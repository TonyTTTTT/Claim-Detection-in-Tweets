NewsClaims	6938	Scientists have determined the virus came about naturally, but there is some uncertainty about how it first infected people.	1
NewsClaims	6939	While a plurality of Americans (43%) say the new coronavirus most likely came about naturally, nearly three-in-ten (29%) say it most likely was created in a lab, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted from March 10 to 16, 2020, as part of the Center’s nearly yearlong Election News Pathways project.	1
NewsClaims	6940	Around a quarter of adults (23%) say it is most likely that the current strain of coronavirus was developed intentionally in a lab; another 6% say it was most likely made accidentally in a lab.	1
NewsClaims	6941	No, the new coronavirus didn't come from outer space.	1
NewsClaims	6942	One wild theory that has made its way around the web is that the virus came from space.	1
NewsClaims	6943	Spoiler alert: The virus did not come from space.	1
NewsClaims	6944	Recently, Chandra Wickramasinghe, known for his work in astronomy and astrobiology, spread the idea that the virus was living on a comet and a piece of that space rock may have fallen to Earth during a brief fireball event over China in October 2019.	1
NewsClaims	6945	"However, scientists have rebuked Wickramasinghe's suggestions that any such illness might have extraterrestrial origins, and his ideas have largely been considered pseudoscience or ""bad science."""	1
NewsClaims	6946	However, despite these theoretical possibilities, there is no credible evidence to show that the new coronavirus came from outer space, he added.	1
NewsClaims	6947	Epstein says that even if COVID-19 becomes a mere seasonal disease, knowing pets’ role in viral spread will be useful.	1
NewsClaims	6948	"""CDC does not have evidence that pets can spread COVID-19, and there’s no reason to think pets might be a source of infection based on the information we have at this time,"" Casey Barton Behravesh, director of the agency’s One Health Office in the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, tells Science."	1
NewsClaims	6949	"""When you walk your dog, stay 6 feet away from other animals."	1
NewsClaims	6950	"""Our focus now should be on human-to-human transmission, because that’s what’s driving the epidemic."""	1
NewsClaims	6951	Given that there are about 150 million dogs and cats in the United States alone, if pets could readily catch COVID-19, we would be seeing tons of cases of by now, says Shelley Rankin, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.	1
NewsClaims	6952	"The same day, Hong Kong’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department reported that a 17-year-old Pomeranian—which had initially tested ""weak positive"" for SARS-CoV-2—had indeed been infected by the virus, likely by its owner or another human."	1
NewsClaims	6953	The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has advised against it, and many experts are concerned about spreading unwarranted fear—especially amid reports that some owners have begun to abandon their pets.	1
NewsClaims	6954	"""Even though we have no evidence that pets can transmit the virus, we desperately need [more] evidence one way or the other,"" says Timothy Baszler, executive director of the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WADDL), which announced 2 weeks ago that it had developed a COVID-19 test for pets."	1
NewsClaims	6955	Warmer temperatures destroys the virus faster, but cool temperatures protect it.	1
NewsClaims	6956	Serious question: Can the virus be spread via packages/parcels?	1
NewsClaims	6957	So if I was handling a lot of packages from China and dealing with co-worker who do I'd be very concerned.	1
NewsClaims	6958	"INDIANAPOLIS, March 10, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced new data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled BLAZE-1 Phase 3 study, demonstrating bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) 700 mg and etesevimab (LY-CoV016) 1400 mg together significantly reduced COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths (""events"") in high-risk patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19."	1
NewsClaims	6959	The latest conspiracy theories about the new coronavirus, which first led to an outbreak in Wuhan, China in late 2019, allege that the virus was man-made, rather than the natural result of people coming into contact with wild animals.	1
NewsClaims	6960	Multiple episodes of his talk show address both of these groundless theories and claim there is evidence that “proves” the new coronavirus was “man-made.”	1
NewsClaims	6961	The blogger’s contention that the new coronavirus may have been engineered using a SARS viral vector, Andersen said, is “just as absurd” as the HIV theory.	1
NewsClaims	6962	“The genetic data is pointing to this virus coming from a bat reservoir,” he said, “not a lab.”	1
NewsClaims	6963	The VitaminC4Covid​​ campaign, so far backed by about 350 leading vitamin C researchers, doctors, healthcare professionals and nutritionists along with 5000+ signatories from about 60 countries, says evidence shows injected or orally taken high doses of vitamin C can halt the onset of severe COVID-19 symptoms.	1
NewsClaims	6964	Vaccines, by their nature, are reactive.	1
NewsClaims	6965	Vitamin C, together with vitamin D and zinc, are proactive.	1
NewsClaims	6966	A randomly controlled trial in Wuhan showed 68% less mortality among critical COVID-19 ICU patients on a ventilator with high dose vitamin C. A Spanish trial showed 17 out of 18 ICU patients had undetectable vitamin C levels.	1
NewsClaims	6967	The best way to keep surfaces in your environment clean is to wipe them down frequently with germ-killing aerosol sprays and antiseptic wipes.	1
NewsClaims	6968	And washing your hands with soap and water — properly and frequently — is still the most important thing you can do to help prevent the spread of both coronaviruses and other infectious diseases.	1
NewsClaims	6969	A single individual can infect more people.	1
NewsClaims	6970	"""They could still easily be spreading it around: whether by spending time in close contact with other people or by touching things like doorknobs and faucet handles."	1
NewsClaims	6971	"That’s why it’s so important to do everything you can to help slow the spread of COVID-19 — that includes staying home, practicing social distancing and practicing good hand hygiene."""	1
NewsClaims	6972	They can also pass that virus along to others — even if they never show any symptoms of infection.	1
NewsClaims	6973	Or even that taking a hot bath can stop COVID-19	1
NewsClaims	6974	The lag in testing means the true number of cases is still unknown, so a lot of infected people might be walking around in public, not realizing they’re spreading the virus.	1
NewsClaims	6975	Myth #2: Warm water or air can kill the coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	6976	That means people may be spreading germs over a longer period of time and not even realize it.	1
NewsClaims	6977	But contrary to what you might have heard, neither taking a hot bath nor drying your hands with a hair dryer set on high heat will kill the coronavirus — either inside or outside of your body.	1
NewsClaims	6978	"That’s why social distancing is so critical."""	1
NewsClaims	6979	Trump says Sweden is ‘paying heavily’ for not ordering coronavirus lockdown as he boasts US made ‘correct decision’	1
NewsClaims	6980	"Despite other European countries enforcing strict lockdowns to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Sweden, with a population of 10 million, has gone for a ""low-scale approach."""	1
NewsClaims	6981	"Anders Tegnell, the country’s chief epidemiologist and top strategist for the country in the fight against the pandemic, said it ""is much more sustainable"" over a longer period."	1
NewsClaims	6982	"One local, Johan Mattsson, told The New York Times: ""My respect for those who died, but we are doing something right here in Sweden."""	1
NewsClaims	6983	Trump previously suggested that the rising number of Swedish deaths is because of the country’s idea to embrace herd immunity.	1
NewsClaims	6984	"But Swedish Health Minister Lena Hallengren recently told The Associated Press: ""We have never had a strategy for herd immunity."""	1
NewsClaims	6985	"On Wednesday, the World Health Organization praised Sweden as a ""model"" for other countries to follow amid the pandemic."	1
NewsClaims	6986	"Mike Ryan, the WHO’s top emergencies expert, said there are ""lessons to be learned"" from the Scandinavian country."	1
NewsClaims	6987	Thousands of social media posts and several YouTube videos are spreading false claims that an American researcher who worked at Harvard University was involved in developing the novel coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	6988	Hong Kong (CNN) A prominent Chinese official has promoted a conspiracy theory that the United States military could have brought the novel coronavirus to China -- and it did not originate in the city of Wuhan, as thought.	1
NewsClaims	6989	"""Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food."""	1
NewsClaims	6990	"""There is no evidence that drinking lots of water flushes out the new coronavirus or the stomach acid kills the virus."""	1
NewsClaims	6991	The CDC advises to wash your hands with soap and water for about 20 seconds before preparing or eating food.	1
NewsClaims	6992	TUCSON - A News 4 Tucson viewer asked us about ingesting the coronavirus from food or drinks and if stomach acid kills the coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	6993	"Among these were the false claim that the virus was part of a Chinese ""covert biological weapons programme"", and a baseless claim that a Canadian-Chinese spy team had sent coronavirus to Wuhan."	1
NewsClaims	6994	The claim that the virus was man-made has been pushed by numerous conspiracy groups on Facebook, obscure Twitter accounts and even found its way on to primetime Russian state TV.	1
NewsClaims	6995	Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, has repeatedly promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US.	1
NewsClaims	6996	On 12 March, he said in a tweet that it might have been the US army that brought the virus to Wuhan.	1
NewsClaims	6997	"A day later, he tweeted an article by the website Global Research headlined ""Further evidence that the virus originated in the US"", and urged users to read and share it."	1
NewsClaims	6998	Is there any evidence for lab release theory?	1
NewsClaims	6999	COVID-19: Further Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US.	1
NewsClaims	7000	The article Mr Zhao tweeted was penned by regular contributor Larry Romanoff, who reiterates the conclusion from his earlier piece - now deleted - that the virus did not originate in China.	1
NewsClaims	7001	But the Chinese research and articles in the magazine Science that he quotes do not actually call into question China being the place where the outbreak started.	1
NewsClaims	7002	Instead, they only suggest that specifically the animal market in Wuhan may not have been the origin of the new coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	7003	"Mr Romanoff also claims that Japanese and Taiwanese scientists ""have determined that the new coronavirus could have originated in the US""."	1
NewsClaims	7004	Mr Romanoff also claims - without evidence - that the US military germ laboratory in Fort Detrick, Maryland, may have been the original source of the virus.	1
NewsClaims	7005	"Claims by elements in the Chinese government and media about the US being a possible origin of the virus prompted a response from US President Donald Trump who referred to Covid-19 as a ""Chinese virus""."	1
NewsClaims	7006	"Fox News primetime host Tucker Carlson cited a study raising the possibility that the coronavirus ""accidentally escaped from a lab in Wuhan""."	1
NewsClaims	7007	"It concluded that ""the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan""."	1
NewsClaims	7008	"Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the US government's response to the Ebola outbreak, tweeted in response to reports about an accidental lab leak: ""The science doesn't preclude a lab origin but does indicate it's quite unlikely."""	1
NewsClaims	7009	Therefore, convincing more Americans the vaccine is safe could have a dramatic impact on efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19.	1
NewsClaims	7010	He attributed his speedy recovery to experimental monoclonal antibody treatment.	1
NewsClaims	7011	Moncef Slaoui, who leads the federal vaccination program, told CNN the vaccine was safe for people who have recovered from coronavirus and presents stronger and possibly longer protection than past infection.	1
NewsClaims	7012	"The novel coronavirus and the SARS outbreak of 2003 have two things in common: Both are from the coronavirus family, and both have been associated with animals commonly sold in ""wet markets."""	1
NewsClaims	7013	"Is eating ""alkaline food"" a viable diet to prevent infection from COVID-19?"	1
NewsClaims	7014	Hydroxychloroquine ‘not an effective treatment’ for COVID-19, leads to longer hospital stays	1
NewsClaims	7015	The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment option for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, according to a new study in the	1
NewsClaims	7016	"""In this analysis of the RECOVERY trial, we determined that hydroxychloroquine was not an effective treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19,"" wrote lead author Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford, and colleagues."	1
NewsClaims	7017	Truth: Antibiotics are used to fight bacteria, not viruses, which is what COVID-19 is.	1
NewsClaims	7018	"This myth may have stemmed from the fact some people who are hospitalized for coronavirus have received antibiotics, but that’s because bacterial ""co-infections"" are possible with COVID-19, according to the WHO."	1
NewsClaims	7019	Myth #8: Spraying alcohol and chlorine all over yourself kills the coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	7020	"From the WHO, ""there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes."""	1
NewsClaims	7021	Truth: This myth has been stemming from the false idea that cold and hot temperatures can kill the virus.	1
NewsClaims	7022	COVID-19 is a respiratory infection, yes, but it requires its own vaccine, which is in the testing phase right now.	1
NewsClaims	7023	COVID-19 can be transmitted anywhere, regardless of how hot or humid the air is.	1
NewsClaims	7024	Truth: The CDC and the WHO have said this from the start: the most effective way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is with frequent handwashing with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol.	1
NewsClaims	7025	"Truth: The WHO says, ""vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus."""	1
NewsClaims	7026	Myth #10: Rinsing your nose, and gargling, with saline solution helps prevent COVID-19 infection	1
NewsClaims	7027	Myth #1: Cold weather kills the novel coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	7028	Myth #13: Antibiotics prevent and treat COVID-19	1
NewsClaims	7029	Truth: This will not cure you of COVID-19 if it has already entered your body.	1
NewsClaims	7030	Myth #14: There are medicines to prevent and treat coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	7031	Truth: The World Health Organization says people of all ages need to take steps to protect themselves from COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	7032	The antibiotic does not treat the virus itself.	1
NewsClaims	7033	This is why social distancing and frequent hand washing is so important.	1
NewsClaims	7034	‘Cold weather kills coronavirus’ and 13 other COVID-19 myths you may be falling for	1
NewsClaims	7035	The best ways are frequent hand washing, the use of hand sanitizer, and social distancing.	1
NewsClaims	7036	You can use medication to relieve symptoms, but those with severe symptoms from coronavirus should seek help from a medical professional.	1
NewsClaims	7037	Myth #11: Eating garlic helps prevent COVID-19 infection	1
NewsClaims	7038	Myth #4: Coronavirus can be transmitted through mosquito bites	1
NewsClaims	7039	Truth: It’s too soon to tell whether UV light is an effective way to kill the new coronavirus, and the World Health Organization does not suggest its use.	1
NewsClaims	7040	Still, the best way to prevent getting COVID-19 is to wash your hands often.	1
NewsClaims	7041	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	7042	While it is true that the U.K.-based Pirbright Institute has accepted funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the patent referenced in these claims covers a separate strain of coronavirus that only affects chickens, not humans.	0
NewsClaims	7043	“Pirbright does not currently work with human coronaviruses,” the institute said in a January 2020 post on its website responding to the patent conspiracy theory.	0
NewsClaims	7044	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7045	Fact-checking websites FactCheck.org and Snopes pointed to a Jan. 21, 2020 tweet from Jordan Sather, a U.S. conspiracy theorist with 140,000 Twitter followers and 218,000 subscribers to his “Destroying the Illusion” YouTube channel, as the earliest example of this claim.	0
NewsClaims	7046	InfoWars then repeated it in the Jan. 23 article about the simulation co-hosted by the Gates Foundation described above.	0
NewsClaims	7047	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	7048	A study published in the journal Nature in February 2020 found the new virus’s genome is “96 percent identical” to a bat coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	7049	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7050	Similar conspiracy theories have been promoted by misinformation websites during earlier disease outbreaks.	0
NewsClaims	7051	For example, NaturalNews.com, a Red-rated network of site promoting both medical and political conspiracies, previously labeled the Ebola virus as a “bioweapon” during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa.	0
NewsClaims	7052	The earliest mention NewsGuard could find of the COVID-19 virus being called a “bioweapon” was a Jan. 23, 2020 video from U.S. conspiracy theorist David Zublick, titled “Breaking: Coronavirus Is Bioweapon For Population Control.” Zublick has 160,000 subscribers on YouTube.	0
NewsClaims	7053	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	7054	In an April 2020 article from the BBC, Dr. Simon Clarke, a microbiology professor at the University of Reading, described claims that 5G either transmits the virus, or suppresses the immune system, thus making people more vulnerable to it, as “complete rubbish.” A March 2020 report from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection found no evidence that 5G networks posed a risk to human health.	0
NewsClaims	7055	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7056	The claims then spread across Facebook Groups and YouTube channels already steeped in misleading 5G claims (such as asserting that it can cause cancer) with a new angle highlighting the novel coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	7057	They were then amplified on social media by celebrities such as actor Woody Harrelson and boxer Amir Khan.	0
NewsClaims	7058	Some in the U.K. eventually attacked 5G telephone poles, prompting the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport to call on platforms to take action against the spread of these conspiracies.	0
NewsClaims	7059	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	7060	Colloidal silver is a liquid substance containing silver particles.	0
NewsClaims	7061	According to the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, “scientific evidence doesn’t support the use of colloidal silver dietary supplements for any disease or condition.” Using colloidal silver can cause a condition called argyria, a permanent bluish-gray discoloration of the skins, nails, and gums.	0
NewsClaims	7062	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7063	Despite the lack of evidence supporting its use, colloidal silver has been promoted as a cure for all kinds of ailments, from bacterial and viral infections to cancer, since the late 19th century.	0
NewsClaims	7064	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	7065	Miracle Mineral Solution, or MMS, is chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleaching agent that has been promoted as a cure-all for everything from cancer to autism.	0
NewsClaims	7066	There is no reliable evidence supporting its use for COVID-19 or any other disease, and ingesting it can cause serious side effects such as severe vomiting and acute liver failure, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.	0
NewsClaims	7067	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7068	It was later promoted in a January 27, 2020 article posted on the website of Jim Humble, a former Scientologist and gold prospector who claimed to have discovered MMS in 1996.	0

NewsClaims	7072	MYTH: “High doses of vitamin C have been proven to be an effective treatment for COVID-19.”	0
NewsClaims	7073	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	7074	Vitamin C has some marginal benefits for the common cold, such as reducing the duration of symptoms if it is taken before catching the cold, but those benefits can be achieved with a diet that includes 200 milligrams of vitamin C, according to Harvard Health Publishing.	0
NewsClaims	7075	The daily dosage being tested in the Chinese trial is 60 times higher.	0
NewsClaims	7076	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7077	The claim originated in a Jan. 26, 2020 press release titled “Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus,” from the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine, which promotes large doses of nutritional supplements.	0
NewsClaims	7078	The article was then republished in full the next day on HealthImpactNews.com, a Red-rated network of health sites with 450,000 Facebook followers that has promoted false health claims such as the debunked link between vaccines and autism.	0
NewsClaims	7079	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	7080	This myth relies on the false claim that what you eat or drink creates an alkaline environment in your body, making it less acidic by raising its pH level.	0
NewsClaims	7081	In reality, drinking lemon juice (or anything else) cannot change your body’s pH level.	0
NewsClaims	7082	Similar alkaline diet remedies have been falsely promoted as cancer cures, prompting Cancer Research UK to call them “biological nonsense” in a March 2014 article.	0
NewsClaims	7083	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7084	This claim, according to a March 2020 article from PolitiFact.com, has its origins in a video shared on Facebook Messenger by Marian Gorban the owner of MrHealthyChannel, an alternative health channel on YouTube with more than 22,000 subscribers.	0
NewsClaims	7085	This claim was first published by the Italian website ViralMagazine.it and received more than 70,000 interactions on Facebook, including more than 40,000 shares, according to data from social media metrics company CrowdTangle.	0
NewsClaims	7086	The false claim was also published on the site FanMagazine.it, which is connected to the Facebook Pages ღஐღ Semplicemente Charlie ღஐღ and Ti amo, però ღஐღ Semplicemente Charlie ღஐღ, which have more than 2 million followers and more than 600,000 followers, respectively.	0
NewsClaims	7087	MYTH: “The Italian Government is preventing migrants from being tested for COVID-19.”	0
NewsClaims	7088	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	7089	The Italian Government has never forbidden the testing of migrants for the COVID-19 virus.	0
NewsClaims	7090	As stated by the director of the provincial health authority of Ragusa Angelo Aliquò in February 2020, “Ministerial guidelines say that only those who come from areas at risk and have symptoms need to be tested.” According to NewSicilia.it, three migrants with symptoms who arrived in Italy on the Ocean Viking ship were tested for COVID-19 in February 2020, and the tests came back negative.	0
NewsClaims	7091	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7092	This claim appears to have first been published by the Red-rated Italian website VoxNews.info on Feb. 27, 2020, misquoting an interview of Aliquò by Il Primato Nazionale, a site connected to the neo-fascist movement CasaPound.	0
NewsClaims	7093	The next day, the Red-rated ViralMagazine.it published an almost identical article — adding more fabricated quotes attributed to Aliquò — which received more than 80,000 Facebook interactions, more than a third of which were shares, according to CrowdTangle data.	0
NewsClaims	7094	MYTH: “Bill Gates plans to use COVID-19 to implement a mandatory vaccine program with microchips to surveil people.”	0
NewsClaims	7095	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	7096	Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his charitable foundation have long supported vaccine initiatives.	0
NewsClaims	7097	However, there is no vaccine — for COVID-19 or otherwise — with a microchip or other surveillance feature.	0
NewsClaims	7098	In December 2019, researchers at MIT, who had received funding from the Gates Foundation, published a paper about technology they developed that can keep a vaccination record on a patient’s skin with an ink-like injection that could be read by smartphone.	0
NewsClaims	7099	The technology does not have the capacity to track patients’ movements, Kevin McHugh, a Rice University bioengineering professor who worked on the study while at MIT, told FactCheck.org.	0
NewsClaims	7100	The Gates Foundation told FactCheck.org that the research is unrelated to COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	7101	Some versions of this conspiracy theory also assert that the purpose of the “tracking” vaccine is to control or reduce the world population, which is also false.	0
NewsClaims	7102	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7103	According to FactCheck.org and BuzzFeed News, conspiracy theorists have distorted comments that Gates made during a March 18 Reddit forum.	0
NewsClaims	7104	Gates discussed “digital certificates,” a technology used to transmit encrypted information online, as part of a solution to expand COVID-19 testing.	0
NewsClaims	7105	However, conspiracy theorists claim that Gates was referring instead to the MIT research into skin-based vaccination records — which is not related to the “digital certificates” Gates was describing.	0
NewsClaims	7106	The website BioHackInfo.com published a story containing the false claims on March 19, 2020, the day after Gates’ Reddit forum, using the term “microchip,” which did not appear in either Gates’ statements or the research.	0
NewsClaims	7107	FactCheck.org and BuzzFeed News reported that the conspiracy theory was subsequently amplified by a YouTube video from the Jacksonville, Florida-based Law of Liberty Baptist Church, which received 1.9 million views as of publication.	0
NewsClaims	7108	MYTH: “Getting a flu shot increases your risk of getting COVID-19.”	0
NewsClaims	7109	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	7110	There is no evidence that the flu vaccine either increases or decreases the risk of being infected with the COVID-19 virus.	0
NewsClaims	7111	Studies cited to back this false claim, such as one published in the journal Vaccine in January 2020, did not mention the COVID-19 virus, having used data collected years before the virus emerged.	0
NewsClaims	7112	While some studies — including the research published in Vaccine — have found an association between the flu shot and non-influenza respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold, over the course of a single flu season, that association was not found in a larger study that included data from multiple seasons.	0
NewsClaims	7113	According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “the preponderance of evidence suggests that this is not a common or regular occurrence and that influenza vaccination does not, in fact, make people more susceptible to other respiratory infections.”	0
NewsClaims	7114	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7115	DisabledVeterans.org, a news site that calls itself a “watchdog” of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, first promoted the claim in a March 11, 2020 article that cited the January 2020 Vaccine study.	0
NewsClaims	7116	The same study was cited in an April 16, 2020 article by Collective Evolution, a NewsGuard Red-rated conspiracy theory website that has more than 5 million followers on Facebook.	0
NewsClaims	7117	MYTH: “Wearing a face mask can cause hypercapnia, a condition of too much carbon dioxide”	0
NewsClaims	7118	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	7119	Hypercapnia is caused by having much carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, such as can be caused by underwater diving.	0
NewsClaims	7120	Health care workers who regularly wear face masks for long periods of time do not develop this condition.	0
NewsClaims	7121	According to health fact-checking website HealthFeedback.org, even surgical and N95 masks are porous enough to allow gas molecules such as carbon dioxide to pass through, while limiting exposure to the respiratory droplets that could spread the COVID-19 virus.	0
NewsClaims	7122	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7123	The earliest example of this claim was an April 6, 2020 post from a Facebook user in Bangkok, Thailand, cited in a May 2020 article from Agence France-Presse.	0
NewsClaims	7124	English language posts promoting the same claim began circulating in Thailand and South Africa that same month, AFP reported.	0
NewsClaims	7125	MYTH: “Wearing a face mask will push the COVID-19 virus into your brain”	0
NewsClaims	7126	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	7127	There is no evidence that wearing a mask will cause the COVID-19 virus to enter the brain.	0
NewsClaims	7128	“Breathing out the virus is not going to appreciably change the amount that is there,” Sarah Stanley, an infectious diseases professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told The Associated Press in a May 2020 fact-checking article.	0

NewsClaims	7161	In their latest updates, smartphones from the two brands included this exposure notification system.	0
NewsClaims	7162	Some countries, like Italy, used this feature to build their national app, but others, like France, chose not to.	0
NewsClaims	7163	In countries where governments decided to use it, citizens still had to download the app first, and to activate the feature before it did anything.	0
NewsClaims	7164	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7165	In Italy, NewsGuard Red-rated site ByoBlu.com claimed on May 26 that the Google feature had been automatically installed and activated on people’s phones.	0
NewsClaims	7166	In France, the Red-rated website LumiereSurGaia.com, a hub of coronavirus hoaxes and false information about topics such as UFOs and the environment, published on May 29 an article claiming that the French government had secretly installed its app on people’s phones, and encouraged users to uninstall it.	0

NewsClaims	7177	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7178	The earliest mention of this false claim found by NewsGuard was a story from ShadOlsonShow.com in late February.	0
NewsClaims	7179	Radio host Olson reported on his site that he was “First to reveal the links to the ‘gain of function’ coronavirus study by Dr. Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina.” The claim received further attention when it was spread in a series of March 3, 2020 tweets from an account using the name Greg Rubini, which has 129,000 followers.	0
NewsClaims	7180	According to a June 2020 article from BuzzFeed News, the Twitter account is run by an Italian man named Gregorio Palusa, a sound engineer and marketer.	0
NewsClaims	7181	Palusa has no proven expertise in national security or intelligence, but conservative cable news network One America News brought this myth further into the mainstream by citing his tweets under the Greg Rubini pseudonym in a March 14 report, describing him as “a citizen investigator and monitored source amongst a certain set in the D.C. intelligence community,” according to liberal nonprofit Media Matters.	0

NewsClaims	7185	There is no evidence that Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has personal financial investments in vaccines being developed for COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	7186	Fauci’s agency is working with pharmaceutical company Moderna on a potential vaccine — one of 141 that are currently in development, according to the World Health Organization — but PolitiFact found no record of a business relationship between Fauci and Moderna in an April 2020 search of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s database.	0
NewsClaims	7187	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	7188	PolitiFact reported that the false accusation against Fauci was made in an April 12, 2020 post on an anti-vaccine Facebook page called I Am Awake, which has 13,000 likes on the platform.	0
NewsClaims	7189	A similar claim was made by anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., on an April 20 podcast hosted on TruePundit.com, a NewsGuard Red-rated website that ranks among the top 850 U.S. news sites as measured by engagement.	0
NewsClaims	7190	Correction: An earlier version of this page incorrectly credited a 2019 study to researchers at Rice University and MIT.	0

NewsClaims	7216	According to him, 3% of patients have side effects associated with the central nervous system.	0
NewsClaims	7217	In addition, ivermectin causes malformation of fetuses in different animals, cannot be used by pregnant women and, at higher doses, is lethal to mice and causes seizures in dogs.	0
NewsClaims	7218	Paulo Bittencourt warns that the three medications in the covid kit (ivermectin, chloroquine and azithromycin) can lead to acute hepatitis.	0
NewsClaims	7219	Although the occurrence is rare, what worries is the large-scale, over-the-counter use to treat a disease that already affects millions of people.	0
NewsClaims	7220	"""The complication can be more frequent with exacerbated use"", he evaluates."	0
NewsClaims	7221	Bittencourt himself had a patient who used ivermectin every 15 days, at his own discretion, to avoid Covid-19.	0

NewsClaims	7241	This is stated again here:https://www.hindawi.com/journals/iji/2013/151028/#conclusions-and-therapeutic-perspective	0
NewsClaims	7242	Given the results of 6 clinical trials in flu and the common cold, seen in the context of the serious criticism on the efficacy and safety of oseltamivir and zanamivir, PEA should be reconsidered by clinicians as a new treatment modality for the flu and respiratory infections due to its documented efficacy and more importantly its very benign side effect profile.	0
NewsClaims	7243	Furthermore, oseltamivir and zanamivir are known to induce resistance; PEA has a very low likelihood of inducing resistance due to its mechanism of action.	0
NewsClaims	7244	Finally, the ease of application of PEA offers the possibility to have a quick therapeutic answer ready in case of a flu epidemic, especially in cases of a mismatch between circulating strains and the recommendations from WHO.	0
NewsClaims	7245	So first off, PEA is not colloidal silver.	0
NewsClaims	7246	Two different things, two different chemicals and two different effects.	0
NewsClaims	7247	Specifically regarding colloidal silver, it does have antiviral properties.	0
NewsClaims	7248	That doesn’t meant it works well in humans.	0
NewsClaims	7249	All the studies you linked were in vitro, or in a Petri dish.	0
NewsClaims	7250	None in actual humans.	0
NewsClaims	7251	As is it irresponsible to warn people away from it on the premise that in vitro results cannot be expected for in vivo use.	0
NewsClaims	7252	It is common for in vitro and in vivo effects to be similar and there has been no established proof of damage from orally dosed silver nanoparticles in humans (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877176/ ).	0
NewsClaims	7253	You are proposing threats without any evidence, against actual evidence to the contrary supporting it’s effectiveness combined with a long history of use.	0
NewsClaims	7254	To quote the NIH:	0
NewsClaims	7255	Colloidal silver can cause serious side effects.	0
NewsClaims	7256	The most common is argyria, a bluish-gray discoloration of the skin, which is usually permanent.	0
NewsClaims	7257	Do you have any evidence of it’s effectiveness in vivo?	0
NewsClaims	7258	While some studies may find that in vivo and in vitro effects are similiar, that can’t be a one-size-fits all, especially with Medical advice.	0
NewsClaims	7259	Colloidal silver is not FDA approved and unless there are in depth clinical trials studying it’s effectiveness and safety, it shouldn’t be taken either.	0
NewsClaims	7260	But don’t be fooled.	0
NewsClaims	7261	The bat connection	0

NewsClaims	7264	That the virus has natural origins is also apparent from its molecular structure.	0
NewsClaims	7265	As Josie Golding, epidemics lead at the UK-based Wellcome Trust, pointed out: The findings “are crucially important to bring an evidence-based view to the rumors that have been circulating about the origins of the virus.”	0
NewsClaims	7266	Letting Trump off the hook?	0
NewsClaims	7267	Would that it were so simple.	0
NewsClaims	7268	All the news reports thus far rely on anonymous sources within the Trump Administration and the intelligence community — and the former have a strong interest in hyping Chinese responsibility in order to divert the spotlight from Trump’s own chaotic, slow and ill-informed response to the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	7269	A New York Times investigation published on April 11 looked in particular at the role of Matthew Pottinger, a former Wall Street Journal correspondent who is a noted China hawk and now deputy national security adviser in the Trump Administration.	0
NewsClaims	7270	The Times report also reveals that “Mr.	0
NewsClaims	7271	Pottinger and others — including aides to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — pressed for government statements to use the term ‘Wuhan Virus’” in order to help seal the impression of direct Chinese responsibility.	0
NewsClaims	7272	The spat has continued with Trump’s latest move to defund the World Health Organization, ostensibly because it has been too sympathetic to the Chinese leadership, but again, more likely in reality aimed to deflect attention from his own missteps.	0
NewsClaims	7273	The Wuhan ‘wet market’	0
NewsClaims	7274	Indeed the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market had reportedly sold chickens, pheasants, bats, hedgehogs, marmots, tiger frogs and snakes, as well as organs from rabbits and other animals, at some point over the previous months.	0
NewsClaims	7275	Wildlife markets in China, as elsewhere in Asia, are notorious for keeping endangered and wild animals in close-confined unsanitary conditions that provide an ideal breeding grounds for germs and an easy route for viruses circulating in wild animals to infect humans via urine, feces or blood as they are butchered.	0
NewsClaims	7276	This was also the case for previous coronavirus epidemics: the earlier SARS and MERS epidemics, respectively, had civet cats and camels as intermediate hosts.	0
NewsClaims	7277	This has led to calls from over a hundred conservation charities to close wildlife markets and stop bushmeat consumption throughout the world, and to do so permanently — both to protect animals from hunting, poaching and other exploitation and to reduce the potential for the next pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	7278	After all, it is not only coronaviruses that have zoonotic origins.	0
NewsClaims	7279	Ebola is likely to have infected humans from gorillas butchered in the forests of central Africa, while HIV is thought to have crossed into humans from chimpanzees, again probably when they were slaughtered for meat.	0
NewsClaims	7280	Protecting endangered wildlife could therefore not only support biodiversity goals, but help humanity avoid the next global pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	7281	With tens of thousands already dead and trillions of dollars wiped off the global economy thanks to COVID-19, the impacts of pandemics are surely too disastrous to allow conspiracy theories to derail a proper evidence-based global response.	0

NewsClaims	7329	As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted7,11.	0
NewsClaims	7330	Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used19.	0
NewsClaims	7331	However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone20.	0
NewsClaims	7332	Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer; and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.	0
NewsClaims	7333	We also discuss whether selection during passage could have given rise to SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	7334	1.	0
NewsClaims	7335	Natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer	0
NewsClaims	7336	As many early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan market in Wuhan1,2, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location.	0
NewsClaims	7337	Although RaTG13, sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis bat1, is ~96% identical overall to SARS-CoV-2, its spike diverges in the RBD, which suggests that it may not bind efficiently to human ACE27 (Fig.	0
NewsClaims	7338	1a).	0
NewsClaims	7339	Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-221.	0
NewsClaims	7340	Although the RaTG13 bat virus remains the closest to SARS-CoV-2 across the genome1, some pangolin coronaviruses exhibit strong similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, including all six key RBD residues21 (Fig.	0
NewsClaims	7341	1).	0
NewsClaims	7342	This clearly shows that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein optimized for binding to human-like ACE2 is the result of natural selection.	0
NewsClaims	7343	Neither the bat betacoronaviruses nor the pangolin betacoronaviruses sampled thus far have polybasic cleavage sites.	0
NewsClaims	7344	Although no animal coronavirus has been identified that is sufficiently similar to have served as the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV-2, the diversity of coronaviruses in bats and other species is massively undersampled.	0
NewsClaims	7345	Mutations, insertions and deletions can occur near the S1–S2 junction of coronaviruses22, which shows that the polybasic cleavage site can arise by a natural evolutionary process.	0
NewsClaims	7346	For a precursor virus to acquire both the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for binding to human ACE2, an animal host would probably have to have a high population density (to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently) and an ACE2-encoding gene that is similar to the human ortholog.	0
NewsClaims	7347	2.	0
NewsClaims	7348	Natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer	0
NewsClaims	7349	It is possible that a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 jumped into humans, acquiring the genomic features described above through adaptation during undetected human-to-human transmission.	0
NewsClaims	7350	Once acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it1,2.	0
NewsClaims	7351	All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the genomic features described above and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had them too.	0
NewsClaims	7352	The presence in pangolins of an RBD very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 means that we can infer this was also probably in the virus that jumped to humans.	0
NewsClaims	7353	This leaves the insertion of polybasic cleavage site to occur during human-to-human transmission.	0
NewsClaims	7354	Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 made with current sequence data point to emergence of the virus in late November 2019 to early December 201923, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases24.	0
NewsClaims	7355	Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognized transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site.	0
NewsClaims	7356	Sufficient opportunity could have arisen if there had been many prior zoonotic events that produced short chains of human-to-human transmission over an extended period.	0
NewsClaims	7357	This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV, for which all human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short transmission chains that eventually resolve, with no adaptation to sustained transmission25.	0
NewsClaims	7358	Studies of banked human samples could provide information on whether such cryptic spread has occurred.	0
NewsClaims	7359	Retrospective serological studies could also be informative, and a few such studies have been conducted showing low-level exposures to SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses in certain areas of China26.	0
NewsClaims	7360	Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether exposures were due to prior infections with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or other SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	7361	Further serological studies should be conducted to determine the extent of prior human exposure to SARS-CoV-2.	0

NewsClaims	7363	Selection during passage	0
NewsClaims	7364	Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models has been ongoing for many years in biosafety level 2 laboratories across the world27, and there are documented instances of laboratory escapes of SARS-CoV28.	0
NewsClaims	7365	We must therefore examine the possibility of an inadvertent laboratory release of SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	7366	In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired RBD mutations (Fig.	0
NewsClaims	7367	1a) during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies of SARS-CoV11.	0
NewsClaims	7368	The finding of SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses from pangolins with nearly identical RBDs, however, provides a much stronger and more parsimonious explanation of how SARS-CoV-2 acquired these via recombination or mutation19.	0
NewsClaims	7369	The acquisition of both the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans also argues against culture-based scenarios.	0
NewsClaims	7370	New polybasic cleavage sites have been observed only after prolonged passage of low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus in vitro or in vivo17.	0
NewsClaims	7371	Furthermore, a hypothetical generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with very high genetic similarity, which has not been described.	0
NewsClaims	7372	Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required repeated passage in cell culture or animals with ACE2 receptors similar to those of humans, but such work has also not previously been described.	0
NewsClaims	7373	Finally, the generation of the predicted O-linked glycans is also unlikely to have occurred due to cell-culture passage, as such features suggest the involvement of an immune system18.	0
NewsClaims	7374	A rapid review of evidence for claims that the so-called sunshine vitamin could reduce the risk of coronavirus was launched amid concerns about the disproportionate number of black, Asian and minority ethnic people contracting and dying from the disease.	0

NewsClaims	7376	"""While there are health benefits associated with vitamin D, our rapid evidence summary did not identify sufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin D supplements for the treatment or prevention of Covid-19,"" said Paul Chrisp, the director of the centre for guidelines at Nice."	0
NewsClaims	7377	"""We know that the research on this subject is ongoing, and Nice is continuing to monitor new published evidence."""	0
NewsClaims	7378	At the same time, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) reached similar conclusions, stating that the evidence did not support recommending vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections.	0
NewsClaims	7379	However, both Nice and the SACN advised that people should continue to follow official guidance, which was updated in April, advising people to consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day to maintain bone and muscle health, amid concerns people were not getting enough sunlight during lockdown.	0
NewsClaims	7380	Prior to April, the advice was for people with little exposure to sunlight and/or with dark skin to take 10 micrograms all year round and for others to consider doing so in autumn and winter.	0
NewsClaims	7381	Nice said the five studies it had examined all had very low quality of evidence, noting that none had adjusted for confounding factors, such as body mass index, higher socioeconomic deprivation and poorer self-reported health.	0
NewsClaims	7382	The SACN said that one of the most widely supported studies to support the hypothesis that vitamin D reduces the risk of acute respiratory tract infections was one led by Prof Adrian Martineau in 2017.	0
NewsClaims	7383	"But Martineau, a professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, has himself described the evidence on vitamin D as ""mixed"" and the SACN said randomised controlled trials published since 2017 had not supported its conclusions."	0

NewsClaims	7538	The reasons have to do with how fragile the virus is.	0
NewsClaims	7539	But, to be extra careful, there are measures you can take that can reduce the risk even further.	0
NewsClaims	7540	Chinese officials have been screening some frozen food packaging for signs of the virus following their scare with the since-exonerated frozen Norwegian salmon in June.	0

NewsClaims	7543	"Viruses are ""obligate intracellular parasites,"" said Rodney Rohde, PhD, an associate dean for research at Texas State University’s College of Health Professions who focuses on public health microbiology."	0

NewsClaims	7569	However, in combination with washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, this method is very effective.	0
NewsClaims	7570	You can also dry your hands after using paper towels, or instead use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.	0

NewsClaims	7573	Myth #7: Thermal scanners can detect everyone who is infected with coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	7574	Truth: Thermal scanners, like thermometers, can detect people who have a higher-than-normal body temperature due to infection from COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	7575	But not everyone who is infected with the coronavirus has a fever yet.	0
NewsClaims	7576	According to the WHO, “it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.”	0

NewsClaims	7580	The same applies to gargling a saline solution.	0

NewsClaims	7582	Myth #12: The coronavirus only affects older people, and not younger people	0
NewsClaims	7583	Truth: The World Health Organization says people of all ages need to take steps to protect themselves from COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	7584	However, people who are older are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the new coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	7585	People with preexisting conditions are also at an increased risk for more severe complications, such as people with heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease.	0
NewsClaims	7586	This myth may have stemmed from the fact some people who are hospitalized for coronavirus have received antibiotics, but that’s because bacterial “co-infections” are possible with COVID-19, according to the WHO.	0

NewsClaims	7589	The Wild World of Mink and Coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	7590	Mink on the lam and corona’s reverse spillover	0
NewsClaims	7591	The first sign of trouble was that the mink stopped eating, said Hugh Hildebrandt, one of two main mink vets in Wisconsin.	0
NewsClaims	7592	Next came coughing and sneezing, lethargy and labored breathing.	0
NewsClaims	7593	Hildebrandt had worked with mink for 30 years.	0
NewsClaims	7594	He wrote the Merck Veterinary Manual section on mink.	0
NewsClaims	7595	But he had never seen anything like this.	0
NewsClaims	7596	Captive mink have a flu season in the fall, just like people—they get it from us, in fact.	0
NewsClaims	7597	But what appeared in the two mink farms in Taylor, Wisconsin, that saw outbreaks in October was not flu, which tends to sicken the weakest animals.	0
NewsClaims	7598	This took out the strongest mink, the mature adult females.	0
NewsClaims	7599	Over a few days, it killed hundreds per day and about 5,500 total on the two ranches.	0
NewsClaims	7600	It whipped through by coat color, light to dark: The lighter-coat mink, ranch-bred to bring out recessive genes, have long been more delicate.	0
NewsClaims	7601	Five to seven days into the outbreak, the ranchers thought that most of the mink were going to die, said Hildebrandt.	0
NewsClaims	7602	"""And they wake up the next morning, and it's just stopped."	0
NewsClaims	7603	They all start eating.	0
NewsClaims	7604	"They eat more than they ever did before."""	0
NewsClaims	7605	The mink detectives	0
NewsClaims	7606	It wasn’t hard to guess the cause.	0
NewsClaims	7607	Wisconsin was a hotspot of the pandemic from late summer on, and workers at mink ranches had already tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	7608	But the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Madison confirmed the suspicion within days.	0
NewsClaims	7609	The first infections of US farmed mink, in Utah in August, had triggered a national investigation involving wildlife and human health experts across local, state, and federal agencies.	0
NewsClaims	7610	Their questions: How did the virus get there, where would it go next, and what could it do?	0
NewsClaims	7611	Soon after that, a second mink—an Oregon farm escapee—tested positive too.	0
NewsClaims	7612	Global industry meets global pandemic	0
NewsClaims	7613	Of all the animals that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (mostly dogs and cats, plus a few other mammals), the only species to have suffered large-scale casualties so far is the American mink,	0
NewsClaims	7614	Neovison vison,	0
NewsClaims	7615	living on mink ranches around the world.	0
NewsClaims	7616	Since the first mink got sick on a Dutch mink ranch in April, millions of the animals have died or been preemptively culled on nearly 400 ranches across Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Lithuania, Greece, Italy, France, Spain, and Canada.	0
NewsClaims	7617	The US has seen 16 ranch outbreaks since August: 12 in Utah, two in Wisconsin, one each in Oregon and Michigan.	0
NewsClaims	7618	"""It’s a top priority in human and veterinary diagnostic labs,"" Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin veterinary lab, said."	0
NewsClaims	7619	One of about a dozen such labs nationwide, the WVDL has been running COVID tests on farmed mink and people, in addition to its usual tests on cows, chickens, and other animals, and is now operating from 5 A.M. to 2 A.M.	0
NewsClaims	7620	Outbreaks on European mink ranches demonstrated the risks.	0
NewsClaims	7621	If the virus managed to establish a reservoir of disease in farmed mink or their wild cousins, it could hamper our fight against the pandemic, harm wildlife, or even threaten ecosystems.	0
NewsClaims	7622	Particularly if it mutated along the way into something deadlier, more transmissible, or harder for modern medicine to attack.	0
NewsClaims	7623	No man is an island, and neither are diseases	0
NewsClaims	7624	Zoonotic outbreaks happen constantly, and disease reservoirs are everywhere.	0
NewsClaims	7625	In one recent week,	0
NewsClaims	7626	ProMed,	0
NewsClaims	7627	the bulletin of the Massachusetts-based International Society for Infectious Diseases, emailed reports of avian influenza in Chinese people and Polish poultry, influenza in an Oregon horse, anthrax in Croatian cattle, and Australian bat lyssavirus in Queensland.	0
NewsClaims	7628	Raccoons harbor rabies; rodents across the American West harbor the bacterium that causes plague.	0
NewsClaims	7629	Diseases can jump the other way too.	0
NewsClaims	7630	People are a reservoir of tuberculosis for cattle.	0
NewsClaims	7631	Whenever a virus jumps to a new host species, it adapts by mutating.	0
NewsClaims	7632	That has come to pass recently: a new, apparently super-contagious variant first discovered in Britain has since been found in dozens of countries.	0
NewsClaims	7633	No evidence has emerged yet that farmed mink have infected people in the US, though that investigation is still ongoing.	0
NewsClaims	7634	But Denmark’s outbreaks showed the potential.	0
NewsClaims	7635	Hundreds of farms were affected—Denmark, the world’s biggest mink producer, had 17 million animals.	0
NewsClaims	7636	A genetic variant dubbed Cluster-5 looked extra nasty, because the virus’s spike proteins had changed in a way that made it more difficult for the monoclonal antibodies used to treat some COVID patients (President Donald Trump was given monoclonal antibodies when he got sick) to recognize the virus, at least in the lab.	0
NewsClaims	7637	But it wasn’t those few human cases that prompted the Danish and Dutch governments to order culls of their mink.	0
NewsClaims	7638	Instead, as Danish virologist Marion Koopmans wrote in a November letter to	0
NewsClaims	7639	The Lancet	0
NewsClaims	7640	,	0
NewsClaims	7641	it was the risk of establishing a new reservoir for the disease, she wrote, and the unknown consequences.	0
NewsClaims	7642	By mid-November, a lucky break emerged from the Danes’ surveillance: Cluster-5 sequences had stopped turning up in human cases and had, they guessed, dead-ended.	0
NewsClaims	7643	It was noteworthy enough that Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), weighed in.	0
NewsClaims	7644	It didn’t look like Cluster-5 had spread far enough to reduce vaccine efficacy, he said, though it was important to keep an eye on it.	0
NewsClaims	7645	Cluster-5 turned out not as bad a variant as feared, but the next one could be worse.	0
NewsClaims	7646	The mysteries of mutation	0
NewsClaims	7647	When it comes to deciding how much to freak out about a zoonotic virus, the details—like what hosts they prefer, how long they stick around, or how fast they can mutate—make all the difference.	0
NewsClaims	7648	"""Some viruses hardly ever change, but a host can remain infected for decades."	0
NewsClaims	7649	"Others mutate at a furious rate and change to outpace our immune response,"" wrote Hon Ip, a virologist at the National Wildlife Health Center, a lab that has been testing wild animals trapped near mink farms."	0
NewsClaims	7650	In the spring of 2020, scientists at both the National Wildlife Health Center and the veterinary lab hurried to create validated genetic tests for SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	7651	Ferrets, which are closely related to mink, are used as animal models in human respiratory health studies.	0
NewsClaims	7652	"""We have a pretty extensive infrastructure to be able to do this very, very quickly,"" said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin veterinary lab."	0
NewsClaims	7653	"""We’d been at this super-high alert level."	0
NewsClaims	7654	"And they (mink farmers) were seeing thousands die per day."""	0
NewsClaims	7655	They knew, too, that Wisconsin had a heck of a lot of mink.	0
NewsClaims	7656	Last year its farmers produced a million pelts, one-third of the US total and the most of any state.	0
NewsClaims	7657	In the past few years, Taylor County, Wisconsin, produced the most mink pelts in North America, according to Hildebrandt.	0
NewsClaims	7658	CDC teams began collecting samples from the people and the mink on affected farms, while US Wildlife Services live-trapped wild animals nearby.	0
NewsClaims	7659	"Farms that went under quarantine would not be released until all their tests were negative, ""and we’re sure we’re not making a wildlife reservoir,"" Poulsen said."	0
NewsClaims	7660	Tracking who gave what to whom will take some time.	0
NewsClaims	7661	(That effort is being led by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.)	0
NewsClaims	7662	Comparing genomic sequences is a tricky chicken-and-egg problem, but some initial results have emerged.	0
NewsClaims	7663	"""Some of them are very, very clear,"" Poulsen said."	0
NewsClaims	7664	"""People became sick from community-acquired infection, and they gave it to the mink."	0
NewsClaims	7665	"But that’s not all the cases."""	0
NewsClaims	7666	The Mink Princesses are no more, but the farms remain	0
NewsClaims	7667	A billboard once stood in the middle of town that proclaimed Medford, Wisconsin, as the Mink Capital of the World.	0
NewsClaims	7668	That crossroads is now the home of the Taylor County Museum, where by coincidence, Mary Schultz of the Taylor County Historical Society, a longtime area resident, just finished curating an exhibit about the annual Medford Mink Festival once held there.	0
NewsClaims	7669	Schultz described the exhibit: a small space, full of mink-covered things.	0
NewsClaims	7670	"""It was a big thing back in the day,"" she said."	0
NewsClaims	7671	The weeklong festival, first held in 1964, included a pageant to choose a Miss Medford Mink Princess from among the local high-schoolers.	0
NewsClaims	7672	(The exhibit includes scrapbooks of all the princesses.)	0
NewsClaims	7673	The pageant included a swimsuit competition, though, thankfully, no mink bikinis.	0
NewsClaims	7674	Many items that would not spring to mind as wanting a bit of fur were made of or topped with a bit of fur, including toothpicks, a toothbrush, a men’s tie and a bowtie, cufflink mice, and a wallet.	0
NewsClaims	7675	"""I don’t know who in the world would wear that tie,"" Schultz said, amused."	0
NewsClaims	7676	The mink billboard came down, Schultz said, around when the mink festivals stopped—the last Mink Princess picture is from 1979.	0
NewsClaims	7677	Today, even in Medford, mink ranches operate discreetly, as they have done ever since the anti-fur campaigns of the 1980s.	0
NewsClaims	7678	"""There’s a great big mink ranch up on a highway northeast of us,"" Schultz said."	0
NewsClaims	7679	"""There’s no sign out there that says what this is, and I don’t even know who owns it."""	0
NewsClaims	7680	An invisible industry	0
NewsClaims	7681	In her	0
NewsClaims	7682	Lancet	0
NewsClaims	7683	letter, Danish virologist Koopmans wrote that the outbreaks in her country should be a lesson for the fur sector worldwide.	0
NewsClaims	7684	"""(T)here is currently no global overview of the location of such farms, and no mandatory surveillance programme."	0
NewsClaims	7685	"In view of our observations, that is urgently needed."""	0
NewsClaims	7686	That will be no easy task.	0
NewsClaims	7687	In Wisconsin, the mink industry was so under the radar that the Wisconsin state veterinarian, Darlene Konkle, had to ask the Fur Commission USA how to reach the farmers and how many there were.	0
NewsClaims	7688	"""Ordinarily, with mink farms, we don’t have a lot of contact with them,"" said Konkle, who works at the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection."	0
NewsClaims	7689	Just 19 of the state’s nearly 65,000 farms are mink farms.	0
NewsClaims	7690	Mink farmers today typically have thousands of animals—hundreds of thousands, even.	0
NewsClaims	7691	But mink are not considered livestock by Wisconsin law.	0
NewsClaims	7692	Mink farms do not need a license to operate.	0
NewsClaims	7693	DATCP does not inspect mink farms, register them, or survey them.	0
NewsClaims	7694	A similar situation pertains in Utah, where Utah state veterinarian David Taylor said in a December One Health conference call that investigators weren’t welcome at the start.	0
NewsClaims	7695	"""This industry is one that has innately a little bit of mistrust, because of the fact that they have been targets, oftentimes,"" Taylor said."	0
NewsClaims	7696	"""So they are very, very closed to having any outside people come onto their farms and see their operations."""	0
NewsClaims	7697	Nor were they keen on sacrificing more animals to assist the scientists with their mortality studies of the virus, just after they had lost so much, said Taylor.	0
NewsClaims	7698	"""So we had to find some compensation for mortality studies before we could even begin."	0
NewsClaims	7699	"And then they were also holding out for compensation for their losses."""	0
NewsClaims	7700	"With some ""creative financing"" by the Utah state legislature of CARES Act money, and diplomacy on the part of the government officials, Taylor said, the ranch gates began to open."	0
NewsClaims	7701	"""When they’re losing that volume of their business in just literally one week’s time, and they’ve lost 50 percent of their breeders and several thousand mink, having someone come in and just understand that that’s life-shattering for them—that was what opened up the door for communication."""	0
NewsClaims	7702	The culling controversy	0
NewsClaims	7703	Animal health authorities in the US could order mink culls, like those in Europe.	0
NewsClaims	7704	Wisconsin authorities have ordered culls in the past for other outbreaks, like on individual deer farms stricken with chronic wasting disease, but never for a whole industry.	0
NewsClaims	7705	But ordering a cull would require a complex legal process, and a mass quarantine of all farms.	0
NewsClaims	7706	"Suzanne Gibbons-Burgener, a public health veterinarian and infectious diseases epidemiologist at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, wrote, ""The decision to depopulate a group of animals is rarely the first response in a disease event and would typically only be necessary if the risk to human or animal health is significant, and other mitigation steps are insufficient to substantially reduce the risk."""	0
NewsClaims	7707	Animal rights groups see the mink outbreaks as another reason to ban the industry.	0
NewsClaims	7708	"The Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association, in a statement, called farmed mink a ""significant public health threat."""	0
NewsClaims	7709	Those in the mink industry called the European cull and calls for bans an overreaction.	0
NewsClaims	7710	But they also said the European situation differed in important ways.	0
NewsClaims	7711	"Denmark had way more mink, more farms—north of a thousand—in an area ""a third the size of Wisconsin,"" Hildebrandt said, with a lot more people around."	0
NewsClaims	7712	Wisconsin’s few farms are mostly in sparsely populated rural areas.	0
NewsClaims	7713	Such spread has not been documented in America.	0
NewsClaims	7714	The Danish cull faced immediate backlash, prompted the resignation of the minister who ordered it, and was halted partway through.	0
NewsClaims	7715	But on December 21, Denmark’s parliament banned mink farming until 2022 and retroactively provided a legal basis for the cull, underscoring the seriousness of the risks.	0
NewsClaims	7716	Across Europe, millions of mink have died or been killed, the Dutch hastened a previously planned ban on fur farming, and France announced it would close its last four farms.	0
NewsClaims	7717	In contrast, China, also the biggest market for mink fur, has seen the European culls as a market opportunity and stepped up breeding.	0
NewsClaims	7718	The ballad of the wandering mink	0
NewsClaims	7719	How fluid are the boundaries between mink farms and the wild?	0
NewsClaims	7720	Pre-pandemic, American mink that escaped or were intentionally released from European farms were considered some of the worst invaders on the continent.	0
NewsClaims	7721	They established themselves quite handily, out-competed the native European mink, and caused all sorts of ecological damage.	0
NewsClaims	7722	But in North America, there’s not much accounting of how often farmed mink escape or what they have done with themselves.	0
NewsClaims	7723	This is partly because American mink already live in the wild, partly because mink farms are very discreet and not closely regulated, and most of all because very few people have looked.	0
NewsClaims	7724	The few include wildlife disease biologist Jeff Bowman and his colleagues at the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, who have long been researching the spread and impact of ranch escapees in their province.	0
NewsClaims	7725	It is usually obvious, Bowman said, which mink are wild and which are ranch-born, even in the trap.	0
NewsClaims	7726	Your wild mink is small, chocolate-brown, and bitey.	0
NewsClaims	7727	It does not come in sapphire, blue iris, white, palomino, or any other color that brings to mind a celebrity baby name, as your farmed mink does (these colors, incidentally, span white, gray, brown, and black).	0
NewsClaims	7728	A farmed mink has been raised on a twice-daily splat of high-quality agricultural leftovers, such as cheese, eggs, and sausage trimmings, is at least twice the size of a wild mink, and is more docile.	0
NewsClaims	7729	(In one YouTube video at a minkery, a white mink the size of a large housecat, in the arms of its handler, gently waves its paws and squints at the light.)	0

NewsClaims	7733	| Photo courtesy of Larissa Nituch	0
NewsClaims	7734	Near Ontario mink ranches, 64 percent of the mink trapped were either escapees or captive-wild hybrids.	0
NewsClaims	7735	When it comes to the coronavirus, Bowman said, these studies may be instructive.	0
NewsClaims	7736	"""Our studies showed that there are potential pathways for spread from farms to other wildlife,"" he said."	0
NewsClaims	7737	Some of the wild mink that Bowman tested were positive for Aleutian mink disease, which is a known problem on local mink farms, where it can cause reproductive failures and death.	0
NewsClaims	7738	The wild mink had their own strains of the Aleutian virus too—it could potentially go back and forth, Bowman said.	0
NewsClaims	7739	Bowman found that mink clearly escaped from certain problem farms much more than others.	0
NewsClaims	7740	When the researchers trapped farther afield, they found far fewer ranch-bred and hybrid mink, just 18 percent of the total.	0
NewsClaims	7741	It seemed the Ontario mink farm escapees hadn’t managed the sort of widespread invasion that was most worrisome.	0
NewsClaims	7742	Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources officials haven’t studied the issue of mink farm escapees like Canadian researchers have (though they are now considering more surveillance as part of the One Health investigation).	0
NewsClaims	7743	But Arnold Groehler, president of the Wisconsin Trappers Association, said he has been catching the odd mink-ranch escapee for many years.	0
NewsClaims	7744	"In the 1970s, he said, ""it was not uncommon to catch mink that had every phase of color there was."	0
NewsClaims	7745	"Jet black, pure white, some that looked like dairy cows."""	0
NewsClaims	7746	Hugh Hildebrandt, the Wisconsin mink vet, said the harsh economics of fur farming mostly solved the escape issues of yore.	0
NewsClaims	7747	The price of a pelt, which always fluctuated with high fashion’s whims, has for the past few years not even covered the roughly $35 cost of raising the animal.	0
NewsClaims	7748	The industry in Wisconsin began with small family farms over a century ago, and those remaining are still all family farms, even if some are now owned by large foreign companies.	0
NewsClaims	7749	But they are mostly large, with very secure fences.	0
NewsClaims	7750	The fences exist to keep wildlife like raccoons, skunks, and wild mink from helping themselves to the food supply or passing diseases to the captive mink.	0
NewsClaims	7751	Whenever Hildebrandt makes his rounds to a ranch, he checks the guard fence.	0
NewsClaims	7752	Because mink live in such tight quarters and are so vulnerable to disease, ranchers were careful about germs long before COVID struck, Hildebrandt said.	0
NewsClaims	7753	Some already required workers to shower before and after shifts.	0
NewsClaims	7754	It is also common to leave ranch clothes on the ranch, because mink are smelly.	0
NewsClaims	7755	Hildebrandt said mink operations are now limiting, as much as possible, how much they move or handle the animals.	0
NewsClaims	7756	Pelting, or mink harvesting, could not be put off, because it must be done as soon as the mink fur out each fall.	0
NewsClaims	7757	But most of that is done now.	0
NewsClaims	7758	At some ranches everyone arriving is photographed, to assist with contact tracing.	0
NewsClaims	7759	Workers and visitors are distanced and masked up, if not wearing the paper suits that health care workers don.	0
NewsClaims	7760	"""They wouldn’t last long with mink,"" Hildebrandt said."	0
NewsClaims	7761	The CDC sent a field team to Wisconsin that ran through safety procedures for workers and ran a national webinar for mink ranchers.	0
NewsClaims	7762	Government guidelines are all voluntary, except at the affected farms, which were quarantined.	0
NewsClaims	7763	At quarantined farms, anything coming in or out is controlled, including dead mink.	0
NewsClaims	7764	Scientists are still assessing how much risk the bodies pose, said Utah state veterinarian David Taylor, at the CDC’s December webinar on zoonotic disease updates.	0
NewsClaims	7765	Hot composting can kill pathogens, but it has to be done right.	0
NewsClaims	7766	"""After we went onto these farms and saw what they considered to be composting, which really were just piled-up mink, we made the decision here in Utah to just have these buried at landfills,"" he said."	0
NewsClaims	7767	"""We just felt like right now that was the quickest, easiest way to dispose of these animals and the most safe."""	0
NewsClaims	7768	(Pelts currently on the market are all pre-pandemic, from last year’s mink.)	0
NewsClaims	7769	So far the swabs haven’t turned up any virus, said Caitlin Cossaboom, a CDC veterinarian, in a December web presentation.	0
NewsClaims	7770	The question remains of how many farmed mink are out there, on the lam.	0
NewsClaims	7771	"Even in recent years, trapper Groehler has found a few mink with obvious ""heavy ranch genetics,"" which he suspects came from a few old-school ranches left in the area—the sort that might be hand-feeding mink in small sheds."	0
NewsClaims	7772	Some escapees, he said, had become the bane of a trout hatchery near a small-scale mink ranch.	0
NewsClaims	7773	"""A lot of people have a mindset that if the ranch mink would escape, it wouldn’t survive in the wild—they’re used to getting their food twice a day; they wouldn’t know how to hunt,"" he said."	0
NewsClaims	7774	"""But it’s interesting how things survive."	0
NewsClaims	7775	They adapt.	0
NewsClaims	7776	If you are hungry, you eat anything smaller than you.	0
NewsClaims	7777	"And when they find a wonderful food source like a fish hatchery, that’s like heaven on earth for them, and they’re staying put."""	0
NewsClaims	7778	Maybe mink are better at pandemics than we are?	0
NewsClaims	7779	Groehler worries about what SARS-CoV-2 might do among thousands of captive mink.	0
NewsClaims	7780	"""It can mutate from the mink, and what will it turn into next?"	0
NewsClaims	7781	What other animal species will it affect next?	0
NewsClaims	7782	"I don’t think anybody knows yet."""	0
NewsClaims	7783	The animals most at risk right now are the mink on farms—and perhaps their fellow captive mustelids, the endangered black-footed ferret.	0
NewsClaims	7784	These ferrets, once spread across much of the American West, have been reintroduced from near-extinction over the past 40 years through a painstaking captive breeding program, which includes artificial insemination and even training the kits how to hunt.	0
NewsClaims	7785	In northern Colorado, the National Black-Footed Ferret Conservation Center, which houses about 170 adult ferrets, or two-thirds of the captive breeding population, has locked down like a mink farm—no nonessential visitors allowed; handwashing, PPE, temperature checks, disinfection of cages.	0
NewsClaims	7786	The population of ferrets has been split into pods, much like American schoolchildren.	0
NewsClaims	7787	Before SARS-CoV-2, the ferrets’ biggest threat was another zoonotic disease: sylvatic plague, from the same bacterium that causes bubonic plague.	0
NewsClaims	7788	It was also introduced by people, via ships.	0
NewsClaims	7789	For mink or ferrets, people are the disease reservoir.	0
NewsClaims	7790	Though perhaps there is relief in sight.	0
NewsClaims	7791	Some mink will be vaccinated before many of us are.	0
NewsClaims	7792	About 120 black-footed ferrets at the Colorado captive center have already been inoculated with an experimental vaccine created at the National Wildlife Health Center.	0
NewsClaims	7793	There are also some reasons for hope in the nature of the virus and the mink.	0
NewsClaims	7794	As infectious as it is, SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t seem to stick around long outside its hosts—unlike Aleutian mink disease virus, which lasts for months, or the chronic wasting disease-causing prions that can persist in soil for years.	0
NewsClaims	7795	The wild American mink, too, naturally follows CDC guidelines better than many of us have, preferring solitude to the company of its conspecifics.	0
