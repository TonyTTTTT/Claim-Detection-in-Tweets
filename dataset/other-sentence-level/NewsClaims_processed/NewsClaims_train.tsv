NewsClaims	0	Barely 1 month after Chinese health authorities reported the first cases of a mysterious new pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, the world may be on the cusp of a new pandemic.	1
NewsClaims	1	A team led by Shi Zheng-Li of the Wuhan Institute of Virology reported on 23 January that 2019-nCoV's sequence was 96.2% identical to that of a bat coronavirus and 79.5% identical to the SARS coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	2	From the start, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan—which sold mammals as well as fish—was considered a likely source of the outbreak because most of the early patients had visited it.	1
NewsClaims	3	The first known patient became ill on 1 December 2019 and had no links to the market, according to a paper published by Chinese researchers in The Lancet on 24 January that offered details about the first 41 patients in Wuhan.	1
NewsClaims	4	Using these differences and presumed mutation rates, several groups have calculated that the virus began to spread around mid-November 2019—which supports the thesis that spread may have occurred before any of the cases linked to the market.	1
NewsClaims	5	One group put the origin of the outbreak as early as 18 September 2019.	1
NewsClaims	6	“Now it seems clear that [the] seafood market is not the only origin of the virus,” he wrote in an email to Science.	1
NewsClaims	7	The duo targets the protease enzyme used by HIV to copy itself, and it might thwart the coronavirus's protease as well.	1
NewsClaims	8	U.S. biotech Regeneron is trying to identify monoclonal antibodies effective against 2019-nCoV, as it did previously for MERS and Ebola.	1
NewsClaims	9	Asked about the reports, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: “There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV (virus) and the WHO recommends enrolment into a randomized controlled trial to test efficacy and safety.”	1
NewsClaims	10	The U.S. drugmaker Gilead says it has started clinical trials of patients in China infected with the new coronavirus, using an experimental drug called remdesivir, but stressed that this work is investigational at this stage.	1
NewsClaims	11	Heat is key to killing coronavirus on surfaces	1
NewsClaims	12	"""If you wash and dry a cloth face mask on high heat, then you should be good to go,"" according to professor Travis Glenn."	1
NewsClaims	13	For decontamination of packages and masks, the warmer the better	1
NewsClaims	14	Heat is key to killing coronavirus, said Travis Glenn, professor of environmental health science at the University of Georgia College of Public Health.	1
NewsClaims	15	"""Coronavirus lives a few days on many surfaces at room temperature, but it dies far faster at higher temperatures."	1
NewsClaims	16	"It will also live a lot longer if the temperatures are low,"" said Glenn."	1
NewsClaims	17	"""Storing packages in a cold garage is not likely to reduce coronavirus on or in those packages."""	1
NewsClaims	18	Storing delivery boxes in the garage for a few days to allow any possible coronavirus contamination to die off was Glenn’s sister’s strategy.	1
NewsClaims	19	Heat can also be wielded as a tool, said Glenn.	1
NewsClaims	20	"""If you heat a material up to 130 degrees F, which is the high setting on a dryer or a very low oven setting, you only need about 20 minutes to kill greater than 99.99% of the virus,"" said Glenn."	1
NewsClaims	21	"""If you’re heating up to 150 degrees F or higher, then you only need about five minutes to kill greater than 99.99%."""	1
NewsClaims	22	While it’s not practical to toss an Amazon package or a meal kit delivery in an oven or dryer, it could be a very effective way to disinfect face masks.	1
NewsClaims	23	"""If you wash and dry a cloth face mask on high heat, then you should be good to go,"" said Glenn, and you may be able to disinfect a cloth mask just by running it through a hot dryer cycle."	1
NewsClaims	24	"""More testing needs to be done, but we know that the warmer you make it, the less time it takes for the virus to die,"" said Glenn."	1
NewsClaims	25	"So, you can either rotate two masks, leaving one in the car while you shop, or just leave your mask in your car when you get home, as long as you’re parking someplace warm."""	1
NewsClaims	26	This may be welcome news for health care and essential retail workers who wear masks daily and may need a faster or more convenient way to disinfect between uses.	1
NewsClaims	27	Intravenous vitamin C is a safe broad-spectrum antiviral used to effectively treat, cure, or prevent contraction of coronavirus according to many Chinese doctors.	1
NewsClaims	28	High-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels but can also prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS) related to COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	29	Federal health agencies and veterinary experts have said since the beginning of the pandemic that pets are unlikely to pose a significant risk to people.	1
NewsClaims	30	"What’s more, Sykes notes there have been multiple reports of households where one pet tested positive and others didn’t. ""Everything we’ve learned so far suggests that it’s unlikely that pets are a significant source of transmission,"" she says."	1
NewsClaims	31	Indeed, pets are much more likely to get the virus from humans than the other way around.	1
NewsClaims	32	Still, most researchers think pets pose little risk to people—and to other pets as well.	1
NewsClaims	33	A few studies have shown that cats can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats, but all were conducted in an artificial laboratory setting.	1
NewsClaims	34	Hard evidence from controlled studies for this assertion was lacking—and still is—but everything scientists have seen so far suggests cats and dogs are highly unlikely to pass SARS-CoV-2 to humans.	1
NewsClaims	35	That could give scientists a better sense of how likely pets are to transmit the virus to other pets, how long pets remain contagious, and what—if any—clinical signs of COVID-19 show up.	1
NewsClaims	36	"And because there aren’t any drugs for the disease, he says, ""We wouldn’t prescribe anything"" for the pet."	1
NewsClaims	37	Because pet testing remains rare, it’s unclear how many cats and dogs have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.	1
NewsClaims	38	A genetic study of the viral sequences in the first two dogs known to have COVID-19 indicates they caught it from their owners.	1
NewsClaims	39	But some researchers caution that this finding may be due in part to limited testing: Most of the pets that have been evaluated got the tests because they lived with humans who had already tested positive.	1
NewsClaims	40	Myth #1: Cold weather kills the novel coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	41	Truth: The CDC and the WHO have said this from the start: the most effective way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is with frequent handwashing with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol.	1
NewsClaims	42	The WHO says there is “no reason to believe cold weather can kill the new coronavirus,” or other diseases, for that matter.	1
NewsClaims	43	Myth #2: COVID-19 cannot be transmitted in hotter, more humid climates	1
NewsClaims	44	Myth #3: Taking a hot bath prevents you from getting COVID-19	1
NewsClaims	45	Truth: This myth has been stemming from the false idea that cold and hot temperatures can kill the virus.	1
NewsClaims	46	Myth #4: Coronavirus can be transmitted through mosquito bites	1
NewsClaims	47	From the WHO, “there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.” This is because the new coronavirus is spread primarily through droplets when someone with the coronavirus sneezes or coughs.	1
NewsClaims	48	Myth #5: Hand dryers are effective in killing the new coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	49	Truth: The heat from a hand dryer alone is not enough to kill the new coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	50	Myth #6: UV lamps kill the new coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	51	Truth: It’s too soon to tell whether UV light is an effective way to kill the new coronavirus, and the World Health Organization does not suggest its use.	1
NewsClaims	52	Myth #8: Spraying alcohol and chlorine all over yourself kills the coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	53	Truth: This will not cure you of COVID-19 if it has already entered your body.	1
NewsClaims	54	The World Health Organization says they both can be used to disinfect surfaces, however.	1
NewsClaims	55	Myth #9: Getting a pneumonia vaccine protects against COVID-19	1
NewsClaims	56	Truth: The WHO says, “vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.” COVID-19 is a respiratory infection, yes, but it requires its own vaccine, which is in the testing phase right now.	1
NewsClaims	57	Myth #10: Rinsing your nose, and gargling, with saline solution helps prevent COVID-19 infection	1
NewsClaims	58	But this does not apply to COVID-19, and other respiratory infections.	1
NewsClaims	59	Myth #11: Eating garlic helps prevent COVID-19 infection	1
NewsClaims	60	Truth: There is no scientific evidence that eating garlic prevents you from being infected with the novel coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	61	The best ways are frequent hand washing, the use of hand sanitizer, and social distancing.	1
NewsClaims	62	Myth #13: Antibiotics prevent and treat COVID-19	1
NewsClaims	63	Truth: Antibiotics are used to fight bacteria, not viruses, which is what COVID-19 is.	1
NewsClaims	64	The antibiotic does not treat the virus itself.	1
NewsClaims	65	Myth #14: There are medicines to prevent and treat coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	66	Right now, there is no medication recommended to prevent or treat COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	67	"Biological Weapon"", ""Sputnik: Coronavirus Could be Designed to Kill Elderly Italians"", ""Arab Writers: The Coronavirus Is Part Of Biological Warfare Waged By The U.S. Against China"", ""Iran Cleric Blames Trump For Coronavirus Outbreak in Religious City"", ""Coronavirus: Iran's deputy health minister rejects biological warfare theory"", ""Coronavirus: Misinformation and false medical advice spreads in Iran"", ""Civil Defense Chief: Coronavirus Likely Biological Attack against China, Iran"", ""Virus is biological attack on China and Iran, Iranian civil defense chief claims"", ""Coronavirus may be US 'biological attack': IRGC head Hossein Salami"", ""The Lie that Triggered Khamenei's 'Biological Attack' Conspiracy Theory"", ""Prophet's perfume and flower oil: how Islamic medicine has made Iran's Covid-19 outbreak worse"", ""Senior Iranian cleric who died from coronavirus blamed US for outbreak"", ""Marco Rubio: Russia, China and Iran are waging disinformation war over coronavirus"", ""Bioweapon conspiracy video creeps into Senate coronavirus hearing"", ""Constituyente Elvis Méndez: ""El coronavirus lo inocularon los gringos, ""Why Coronavirus Conspiracy Theories Flourish."	1
NewsClaims	68	"[324][325], Social media posts and internet memes claimed that COVID-19 derives from ""Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease 19"", or similar, as supposedly the ""19th virus to come out of China""."	1
NewsClaims	69	[25] The conspiracy theory spread widely on social media, but subsequent scientific investigation showed that the virus originated in bats.	1
NewsClaims	70	[48], On 22 February, US officials alleged that Russia is behind an ongoing disinformation campaign, using thousands of social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to deliberately promote unfounded conspiracy theories, claiming the virus is a biological weapon manufactured by the CIA and the US is waging economic war on China using the virus.	1
NewsClaims	71	"[f], Iran's Press TV asserted that ""Zionist elements developed a deadlier strain of coronavirus against Iran""."	1
NewsClaims	72	He said Iran was hard-hit because its close ties to China and reluctance to cut air ties introduced the virus, and because early cases had been mistaken for influenza.	1
NewsClaims	73	It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	74	Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses2, it is likely that bats serve as reservoir hosts for its progenitor.	1
NewsClaims	75	“It’s actually a respiratory virus,” Lavin says, meaning that the virus is transmitted via tiny droplets of spit and mucus that may be expelled when coughing and sneezing.	1
NewsClaims	76	However, it’s not believed that it’s transmitted by water,” Lavin says.	1
NewsClaims	77	“The good news is that the average amount of chlorine that’s in a pool is going to kill the virus,” Lavin says.	1
NewsClaims	78	The CDC reported on March 10 that “there is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the use of pools and hot tubs.	1
NewsClaims	79	Proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (e.g., with chlorine and bromine) of pools and hot tubs should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.”	1
NewsClaims	80	Though the risk of transmission from surfaces is relatively low, especially if you’re practicing good hand-washing hygiene, the bigger concern is the people you’ll meet at the pool.	1
NewsClaims	81	Wash your hands frequently, particularly after you’ve been in a public space or after blowing your nose, sneezing, or coughing.	1
NewsClaims	82	If soap is not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.	1
NewsClaims	83	The novel coronavirus likely originated in bats, but the pathogen may have then hopped into dogs before infecting humans, a new study suggests.	1
NewsClaims	84	"""This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved in a new host (or new host tissue) with high ZAP expression,"" which would place evolutionary pressure on the virus to shed CpG sites, Xia wrote."	1
NewsClaims	85	This is another conspiracy theory about the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, based on recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about biological weapons and the Lugar Lab in Georgia.	1
NewsClaims	86	"A group of 27 prominent public health scientists, from nine countries, wrote a statement published online by the Lancet, that ""strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin"", and they “overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,” just like many other viruses that have recently emerged in humans."	1
NewsClaims	87	Breaking news: China will admit coronavirus coming from its P4 lab	1
NewsClaims	88	Last updated on Feb 3, 2020: Miles Guo identified the Chinese scientist “Deyin Guo” to be the person who created the Wuhan Coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	89	Now the Chinese Communist Party is blaming the U.S. for creating Wuhan coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	90	The Chinese Communist Party will finally admit that the real source of the coronavirus is from “a lab in Wuhan” linked to its covert biological weapon programs.	1
NewsClaims	91	As the “novel” coronavirus originated in Wuhan is spreading to ten countries, more and more people including international bio-weapon experts are questioning its link to the Wuhan P4 lab located about 20 miles from a seafood market where the first few cases of human infections were found.	1
NewsClaims	92	A reliable source, one of the Chinese kleptocrats, told Miles Guo today that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will admit to the public of an “accidental” leak of lab-created virus from a P4 lab in Wuhan to put blames on “human errors”.	1
NewsClaims	93	A recent case report from a team of UK investigators at the University of Cambridge and Barts Health has found that remdesivir is likely to be a highly effective antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2.	1
NewsClaims	94	"""The dramatic response to the drug - on repeated challenge - suggests that it can be a highly effective treatment, at least for some patients."""	1
NewsClaims	95	The problem was its inclusion in a list of medications - known as the covid kit - which, although they have no proven effectiveness in treating Covid-19, was advocated by politicians as a solution to the disease.	1
NewsClaims	96	According to the company, there is no data that support the effectiveness of the drug against Covid-19.	1
NewsClaims	97	[2] Several religious groups have claimed their faith will protect them from the virus.	1
NewsClaims	98	[3] Without evidence, some people have claimed the virus is a bioweapon accidentally or purposefully leaked from a laboratory, a population control scheme, the result of a spy operation, or the side effect of 5G upgrades to cellular networks.	1
NewsClaims	99	It is thought by most virologists that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in bats, and transferred to humans via a spillover event, possibly involving another intermediate animal host.	1
NewsClaims	100	The Pew Research Center found, for example, that one in three Americans believed the new coronavirus had been created in a lab; one in four thought it had been engineered intentionally.	1
NewsClaims	101	Though the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been determined, unfounded speculation and conspiracy theories regarding the possibility the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology have gained popularity during the pandemic.	1
NewsClaims	102	"[28][26][24][29] Despite much speculation on the Internet, ""lab"" related theories are not supported by scientific evidence."	1
NewsClaims	103	Although early clinical tests are underway, today there is no vaccine.	1
NewsClaims	104	On March 12th, 2020, Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta held a global town hall on “Corona Facts and Fears.” During the discussion, Anderson said to the viewing audience, “And, again, if you are concerned about coronavirus, and you haven’t gotten a flu shot…you should get a flu shot.”	1
NewsClaims	105	In searching the literature, the only study we have been able to find assessing flu shots and coronavirus is a 2020 US Pentagon study that found that the flu shot INCREASES the risks from coronavirus by 36%.	1
NewsClaims	106	"), one thing in particular is certainly not helping anyone: Claims that it somehow originated with one woman eating something people are referring to as ""bat soup."""	1
NewsClaims	107	Initially, this novel coronavirus was believed to have started in a large seafood or wet market, suggesting animal-to-person spread, according to the CDC.	1
NewsClaims	108	Is it possible that the novel coronavirus began with an infected animal at the market—and then went on to person-to-person transmission once people were infected?	1
NewsClaims	109	“By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes,” Kristian Andersen, PhD, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research and corresponding author on the paper, said in a statement.	1
NewsClaims	110	There is no evidence to back up this rumor, which has circulated on the internet.	1
NewsClaims	111	In response to the outbreak of the corona virus the Chinese authorities have placed more than a dozen cities under quarantine.	1
NewsClaims	112	The coronavirus 2019-nCoV is a biological weapon developed by the British, even if they pursued scientific goals.	1
NewsClaims	113	"So, molecular biologists saw structural details similar to the 2019-nCoV on the electron microscope image of the ""British invention""."	1
NewsClaims	114	There is no evidence to suggest it was developed artificially as a weapon of mass destruction.	1
NewsClaims	115	Based on our findings we believe this therapeutic approach has the potential to significantly impact the high morbidity and mortality of coronavirus-infected patients and patients infected with other respiratory pathogens.	1
NewsClaims	116	The president was roundly criticized for pondering whether or not UV light or other disinfectants that have proved effective at killing the Wuhan coronavirus on surfaces could somehow be administered inside the body to treat patients suffering from the disease.	1
NewsClaims	117	Want to support Townhall so we can keep telling the truth about China and the virus they unleashed on the world?	1
NewsClaims	118	Pre-clinical findings indicate the technology’s significant impact on eradicating a wide range of viruses and bacteria, inclusive of coronavirus. ...	1
NewsClaims	119	Potential Wuhan Coronavirus Treatment Uses UV Light to Disinfect Lungs	1
NewsClaims	120	"""Our team has shown that administering a specific spectrum of UV-A light can eradicate viruses in infected human cells (including coronavirus) and bacteria in the area while preserving healthy cells,"" stated Dr. Pimentel of Cedars-Sinai."	1
NewsClaims	121	During Thursday's coronavirus task force briefing, President Trump asked White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx whether sunlight has been explored as a possible treatment for those suffering from disease, specifically the coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	122	MacCleery noted during her testimony that the National Institutes of Health says there is no evidence for silver supplements to prevent or treat any condition.	1
NewsClaims	123	"""On a recent episode of Mercola's podcast, he actually advises consumers to take the immunity-boosting supplements he sells and then attempt to contract the COVID-19 virus deliberately because his supplements will allegedly reduce their symptoms."	1
NewsClaims	124	The most striking new claim in recent days, ahead of Biden’s announcement, was in the Wall Street Journal, which reported that US intelligence agencies were told that three unnamed staff at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) were sick enough to go hospital in November 2019 with symptoms that might have been coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	125	Biden also revealed that two of the 18 US intelligence agencies lean towards the theory it jumped from an animal species to humans and “one leans more toward” the lab theory, suggesting a striking lack of clarity.	1
NewsClaims	126	Meanwhile, outside of US intelligence circles, the broad consensus among scientific experts remains that the most likely explanation is that Covid-19 jumped to humans from an animal host in a natural event.	1
NewsClaims	127	The experience of Sars and Mers suggests that coronaviruses do break out naturally and that understanding their origins is difficult.	1
NewsClaims	128	Remdesivir Is Not An Effective Treatment For COVID-19, WHO Says	1
NewsClaims	129	"The panel analyzed remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir-ritonavir used on hospitalized COVID-19 patients and wrote that ""the role of these drugs in clinical practice has remained uncertain."""	1
NewsClaims	130	The World Health Organization is advising against using the antiviral drug remdesivir as a COVID-19 treatment, citing that there is no evidence of the drug improving patients’ recovery.	1
NewsClaims	131	The company said the promising vaccine was shown to be 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 in clinical trials.	1
NewsClaims	132	While there is so far no evidence being offered to support this suggestion, the fact that the mere possibility is being reported in mainstream media outlets like the Washington Post and Yahoo News might seem to give credence to earlier conspiracy theories about the virus being engineered in a biowarfare laboratory and deliberately released into the human population.	1
NewsClaims	133	Whether the virus first infected humans at the infamous Wuhan “wet market” or somehow took a more complicated route via a so far unidentified Chinese laboratory, the ultimate source of the novel coronavirus is still the same: wild populations of bats.	1
NewsClaims	134	None of the current speculation changes the one fact that is established beyond reasonable doubt — SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus, meaning it came from an animal and jumped into the human population.	1
NewsClaims	135	Indeed, it is thanks to their work that we know that SARS-CoV-2 is 96 percent “identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus” (to quote from a Feb. 3 Nature paper co-authored by the institute’s scientists) and that its most likely original host is the horseshoe bat.	1
NewsClaims	136	An investigation by the United States military into the origins of the virus, while noting the high degree of “speculation and rumor” around the issue, concurred that “the weight of evidence seems to indicate ‘natural.	1
NewsClaims	137	In the Nature Medicine paper, the scientists reach the definitive conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 is “the product of natural evolution,” Golding added, “ending any speculation about deliberate genetic engineering.”	1
NewsClaims	138	As the NYT reported, Pottinger and colleagues urged the CIA and other agencies to search for evidence that might “bolster his theory” that the “virus may have originated in one of the laboratories in Wuhan studying deadly pathogens” — even though “they didn’t have any evidence” to support such a contention.	1
NewsClaims	139	This “Wuhan Virus” insult infuriated Beijing, leading one Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson to spin his own retaliatory conspiracy theory about the origins of COVID-19 — that it was brought to China by the US military.	1
NewsClaims	140	Despite these competing geopolitical conspiracy theories, the most likely explanation about the origins of COVID-19 remains the original one: that the virus first spread into the human population of Wuhan from an animal at the city’s notorious “wet market.”	1
NewsClaims	141	While bats are consumed in China and may have been sold in the Wuhan wet market, it seems unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 jumped directly to people from wild bats.	1
NewsClaims	142	An “intermediate host” was probably involved in the virus’s evolution into a form more adapted to humans.	1
NewsClaims	143	A frenzy of speculation has arisen around the idea that the novel coronavirus responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic might originally have escaped from a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan.	1
NewsClaims	144	Scientists writing in Nature Medicine journal on March 17 made clear that “all notable SARS-CoV-2 features” were also observed “in related coronaviruses in nature” and that therefore “we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.”	1
NewsClaims	145	Currently pangolin — a scaly mammal endangered in the wild but often sold in Chinese markets — is the leading contender.	1
NewsClaims	146	Facebook Messenger video falsely claims hot lemon juice can kill the coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	147	On its website, the World Health Organization says that, while it recommends eating plenty of fruits and vegetables to stay healthy, there is no scientific evidence that lemon treats or prevents COVID-19 infection.	1
NewsClaims	148	A video being passed around on Facebook Messenger claims that curing the novel coronavirus is as easy as drinking hot lemon juice.	1
NewsClaims	149	Second, there is no evidence that vitamin C is effective against COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	150	"The hot lemon can kill the proliferation of this virus in our bodies!"""	1
NewsClaims	151	To prevent coronavirus infection, officials advise people to regularly wash their hands, avoid touching their face, disinfect surfaces in their homes daily and avoid people who are sick.	1
NewsClaims	152	“Proud of my dad for spearheading the approval of ivermectin as an affordable drug to fight covid-19.	1
NewsClaims	153	"(JAMA) reporting findings that ""do not support"" the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19."	1
NewsClaims	154	The study showed no evidence that hydroxychloroquine prevented death or helped patients recover from COVID-19 more quickly.	1
NewsClaims	155	Myth: Coronavirus is man-made	1
NewsClaims	156	As the coronavirus outbreak turned into a full-fledged public health crisis, a fringe theory about the virus' origins started to take hold on the internet: that the virus didn't come from nature, but had instead been created in a lab.	1
NewsClaims	157	One version popularized outside China suggested that a Chinese lab had been secretly working on a bioweapon that got leaked.	1
NewsClaims	158	Myth: Home remedies can cure or prevent the virus	1
NewsClaims	159	And vitamin C. But despite what some corners of social media would have you believe, there's no evidence from the outbreak that eating garlic, sipping water every 15 minutes or taking vitamin C will protect people from the new coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	160	Some posts have suggested that putting sesame oil on your body or spraying yourself with alcohol or chlorine will kill the virus.	1
NewsClaims	161	That's also false.	1
NewsClaims	162	Same goes for using essential oils, colloidal silver and steroids.	1
NewsClaims	163	There are some chemical disinfectants , including bleach, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform, that may kill the virus on surfaces.	1
NewsClaims	164	Stay at least three feet away from anyone who may be infected.	1
NewsClaims	165	Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.	1
NewsClaims	166	Myth: Everyone should wear a mask	1
NewsClaims	167	Myth: Heat can kill the virus	1
NewsClaims	168	Reality: Hand dryers can't kill the virus, Hand dryers can't kill the virus, according to WHO .	1
NewsClaims	169	Myth: The virus can be transmitted through mail	1
NewsClaims	170	Getting a letter or package from China won't put you at risk of contracting the virus, according to WHO	1
NewsClaims	171	Taken together, our findings plus the evidence to date suggest that azithromycin is not a sufficiently effective treatment to justify routine use for treatment of COVID-19, neither in the community nor in hospitals.	1
NewsClaims	172	Additionally, there was an aim to cast doubt on the virus’ origins in China and demonstrate China’s support for multilateral efforts to combat its spread.	1
NewsClaims	173	Some small studies have demonstrated the potential for convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19 patients, but there are also some contradictory studies as well.	1
NewsClaims	174	First reported by The New York Times, the hold was placed after senior U.S. public health policy officials in charge of the national COVID-19 response, including National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci and Clifford Lane, NIAID deputy director, argued the emerging data was not strong enough to support approval under EUA.	1
NewsClaims	175	In March, the FDA created a pathway with strict guidelines for physicians to use convalescent plasma on seriously ill COVID-19 patients.	1
NewsClaims	176	In July, the National Institute of Health updated its treatment guidelines which suggest there is “insufficient data” to support convalescent plasma as an approved treatment for COVID-19, CNBC said.	1
NewsClaims	177	It cannot be said that the virus escaped from a P4 laboratory located in Wuhan, as the video claims	1
NewsClaims	178	The AFP fact-checking cell had, for example, proved that the coronavirus detected in China had not been created in the laboratory and then patented, which the author of the video is careful not to specify.	1
NewsClaims	179	Nothing proves that the virus is a creation of the man and more precisely of the French	1
NewsClaims	180	The “patented” and “created by the French” coronavirus?	1
NewsClaims	181	"On social networks, a new conspiratorial theory which circulates massively affirms that the coronavirus was created ""in laboratory"" and ""patented""."	1
NewsClaims	182	"The author of the video over-interprets the term ""inventor"" which is used to designate the owners of the patent, and not the inventors of a potential virus."	1
NewsClaims	183	The Institut Pasteur did not invent COVID-19 or the virus at its origin, Sars-CoV-2.	1
NewsClaims	184	Keep six feet of distance.	1
NewsClaims	185	"But as the climate has turned cold and some of us have moved indoors, John Bush, a professor of applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calls such a rule of thumb ""dangerous"" and ""overly simplistic."""	1
NewsClaims	186	Cotton masks bought them two more minutes of safety.	1
NewsClaims	187	Opening the windows to increase ventilation helps more.	1
NewsClaims	188	However, upgrading from coarse cotton masks to surgical masks increased the number to a whopping two hours.	1
NewsClaims	189	It’s a demonstration that wearing masks properly does help.	1
NewsClaims	190	As you can see, more space helps people stay safe.	1
NewsClaims	191	"The model seems to suggest that, when we’re stuck indoors during the peak of a pandemic, the only way to ""stay safe out there"" is to try to not go out there—or let anyone in—at all."	1
NewsClaims	192	PHOENIX – As the first wave of the pandemic picked up speed in Arizona in the spring of 2020, Juan and Rosa Aguirre heard that doctors in Mexico were prescribing a medicine thought to prevent and cure COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	193	Medical experts contend there isn’t yet enough credible science to justify using ivermectin as an off-label prevention or treatment for COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	194	"The ivermectin controversy gained heft in Arizona when a Wisconsin pulmonologist, Pierre Kory, told a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in December 2020 that mountains of data from around the world support ivermectin’s ""miraculous impact"" as a preventative and healing agent of COVID-19."	1
NewsClaims	195	Still, Shah said, most studies purporting that ivermectin is safe and effective in treating COVID-19 patients lack scientific rigor.	1
NewsClaims	196	Studies around the world, she said, provide evidence of the medicine’s efficacy in treating COVID-19 patients.	1
NewsClaims	197	Does eating an alkaline diet prevent you from getting infected with the novel coronavirus?	1
NewsClaims	198	No, that's not true: This claim is a medical myth saying that eating an alkaline diet could prevent someone from being infected with the coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	199	On Facebook, dietician Julie Perk reiterated that the diet does not prevent coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	200	NO, the Institut Pasteur did not create the SARS-CoV-2 virus and release it in the city of Wuhan to cause the pandemic and implicate the Chinese authorities	1
NewsClaims	201	A scientific paper published on March 17, 2020 refutes the theory that a creation by a laboratory may be behind this emerging virus.	1
NewsClaims	202	"See below ""There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was created by humans""."	1
NewsClaims	203	A scientific article published on March 17, 2020 disproved the idea that this virus resulted from a laboratory creation.	1
NewsClaims	204	Coronaviruses are mainly transmitted from person to person via respiratory droplets, either by being inhaled or deposited on mucosal surfaces, including aerosols produced when coughing and speaking.	1
NewsClaims	205	Transmission through contact with contaminated fomites is considered possible, although it has not yet been documented for SARS-CoV-2, and cultivable virus has not been detected in real-life situations [1,2].	1
NewsClaims	206	Viral RNA has also been detected on rare occasions in blood specimens, but there is no evidence of transmission through contact with blood [3-5].	1
NewsClaims	207	Research from the United Kingdom in September and October 2020 concluded that children, notably those between 12-16 years of age, played a significant role in introducing SARS-CoV-2 infection into households, coinciding with the timing of school reopenings [12].	1
NewsClaims	208	It is therefore possible that the difference in observed attack rates by age was due to spousal contacts having higher risk of transmission compared to other contacts, rather than a true age-related difference; there appears to be a research gap in understanding transmission risk for child contacts and non-spouse adult contacts [11].	1
NewsClaims	209	In educational settings, notably primary schools, where appropriate infection prevention and control measures are in place, SARS-CoV-2 transmission from children does not appear to occur very frequently [18-22].	1
NewsClaims	210	There is evidence that there is an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to teachers when secondary schools are open.	1
NewsClaims	211	It has been observed that the effect of school closures for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission was small in the second wave compared to the first wave in Europe, suggesting that schools were able to operate more safely in the second wave through having implemented measures such as symptom screening, asymptomatic testing, contact tracing, sanitisation, ventilation, distancing, reducing group sizes and preventing the mixing of groups [24].	1
NewsClaims	212	Nonetheless, in the third wave, widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (with high transmissibility) increases the possibility of onward transmission in schools and subsequently household settings [17,25], particularly in the absence of appropriate in-school mitigation measures.	1
NewsClaims	213	An age-structured modelling study from the Netherlands, based on the virus characteristics of previously dominant SARS-CoV-2 strains, concluded that the largest impact on community transmission was achieved by reducing contacts in secondary schools [29].	1
NewsClaims	214	Several outbreak investigation reports have shown that COVID-19 transmission can be particularly effective in crowded, confined indoor spaces [31] .	1
NewsClaims	215	Transmission can be linked with to specific activities, such as singing in a choir [32].	1
NewsClaims	216	Poor ventilation in confined indoor spaces is associated with increased transmission of respiratory infections and COVID-19 in particular [33].	1
NewsClaims	217	In a restaurant outbreak of 10 cases in three families in Guangzhou, China, transmission was attributed to the spread of respiratory droplets carrying SARS-CoV-2 by the airflow generated by the air-conditioning [34].	1
NewsClaims	218	Similarly, two other outbreaks from China in January 2020 attribute air conditioning systems using a re-circulating mode as a likely aid to transmission [35].	1
NewsClaims	219	Well-maintained, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems may have a complementary role in decreasing transmission in indoor spaces by increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air [33]	1
NewsClaims	220	Participating in meetings and sharing the same office space has been reported in literature as a risk factor for contracting COVID-19 [39,40].	1
NewsClaims	221	canteen and dressing rooms), transport and accommodation may also contribute to transmission [42].	1
NewsClaims	222	A systematic review and meta-analysis of 172 observational studies both in healthcare settings and the community, that looked into the effect of distance from the source patient and the use of respiratory and eye protection in the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, concluded that physical distancing of at least one metre, use of face masks and eye protection were associated with a much lower risk of transmission [49].	1
NewsClaims	223	Medical professionals from the preeminent organizations on public health Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization have started changing their stance that COVID-19 is airborne.	1
NewsClaims	224	Prior to this, doctors hypothesized that COVID-19 was transmitted by droplets larger than aerosols and primarily through contaminated surfaces.	1
NewsClaims	225	Doctors are concerned with the dosage of droplets that leads to infection.	1
NewsClaims	226	Detering Airborne Transmission with an Air Filter	1
NewsClaims	227	Besides those physical barriers, another weapon to combat airborne transmission is an air filter.	1
NewsClaims	228	An air filter can capture these small particles and trap them, limiting their spread.	1
NewsClaims	229	MERV 16 filters capture up to 96% of virus-sized airborne particles and virus-sized airborne particles*.	1
NewsClaims	230	The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers recommends a minimum MERV rating of 13 to neutralize airborne viruses.	1
NewsClaims	231	Filters are critical in helping capture those droplets circulating in the airstream.	1
NewsClaims	232	They do not have a 100 percent success rate and virus-laden droplets can still circulate even with an air purifier.	1
NewsClaims	233	Along with our precautionary measures, air filters do help in limiting the spread of airborne viruses whether it is a whole-home or portable system.	1
NewsClaims	234	Social distancing, frequently washing hands and surfaces, shielding your mouth and nose with a mask, and installing an air purifier are the best methods to keep you and your family safe.	1
NewsClaims	235	Forty-four percent of Republican respondents in a new survey by Yahoo News and YouGov said they believed that Bill Gates wanted to use coronavirus vaccines to implant location-tracking microchips into people.	1
NewsClaims	236	MYTH: Coronavirus was formulated in a lab in Wuhan	1
NewsClaims	237	Coronavirus myths: viral nature of misinformation	1
NewsClaims	238	SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by exposure to infectious respiratory fluids	1
NewsClaims	239	The principal mode by which people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is through exposure to respiratory fluids carrying infectious virus.	1
NewsClaims	240	People release respiratory fluids during exhalation (e.g., quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing) in the form of droplets across a spectrum of sizes.1-9 These droplets carry virus and transmit infection.	1
NewsClaims	241	Risk of transmission is likewise greatest close to an infectious source where the concentration of these exhaled droplets and particles is greatest.	1
NewsClaims	242	Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from inhalation of virus in the air farther than six feet from an infectious source can occur	1
NewsClaims	243	Although infections through inhalation at distances greater than six feet from an infectious source are less likely than at closer distances, the phenomenon has been repeatedly documented under certain preventable circumstances.10-21 These transmission events have involved the presence of an infectious person exhaling virus indoors for an extended time (more than 15 minutes and in some cases hours) leading to virus concentrations in the air space sufficient to transmit infections to people more than 6 feet away, and in some cases to people who have passed through that space soon after the infectious person left.	1
NewsClaims	244	Current evidence strongly suggests transmission from contaminated surfaces does not contribute substantially to new infections.	1
NewsClaims	245	Transmission through soiled hands and surfaces can be prevented by practicing good hand hygiene and by environmental cleaning.	1
NewsClaims	246	A Peruvian criminal court recently issued an order accusing Bill Gates, George Soros and the Rockefeller family of creating the COVID-19 virus.	1
NewsClaims	247	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the chances of getting coronavirus from delivered packages is likely very low.	1
NewsClaims	248	Researchers said no COVID-19 cases have been linked to contact with packages.	1
NewsClaims	249	The spread of Covid-19 has turned us into a nation of hand-washing obsessives, citizens who vigorously interlace our fingers and circle-scrub our thumbs with an exacting, anxiety-fueled intensity.	1
NewsClaims	250	"""Electric towels"" were supposed to prevent the spread of contagious disease."	1
NewsClaims	251	But it’s not over when you flip off the faucet: Drying your hands matters too, because damp skin provides a hospitable environment for microorganisms and, as a result, might increase the likelihood that you’ll pass on pathogens.	1
NewsClaims	252	"A 2018 study produced even more troubling results, finding that ""potential pathogens and spores"" could be ""dispersed throughout buildings and deposited on hands by hand dryers."""	1
NewsClaims	253	Dyson has made the case that, while other brands of hand dryers might spread disease, its products are perfectly safe even in hospitals.	1
NewsClaims	254	Wash Your Hands—but Beware the Electric Hand Dryer	1
NewsClaims	255	On 28th January – three days before Britain formally left the EU - Dr Belyakov said in a video that 'the artificial nature of the virus, it all adds up to a single puzzle'	1
NewsClaims	256	Covid-19 was accidentally created as a bioweapon in 2015 at the Pirbright Institute in Woking;	1
NewsClaims	257	Earlier this year, the ultra-nationalist Svobodnaya Pressa news website published an article titled: 'Coronavirus - Patent Found That Proves British Trace in 2019-nCoV: The British had a hand in a new dangerous pneumonia'.	1
NewsClaims	258	Mr Sitnikov cited online conspiracy theories which say that Covid-19 is a bioweapon which was accidentally created in the UK.	1
NewsClaims	259	Porton Down, the Salisbury laboratory at the centre of the Skripal Novichok scandal, 'patented a vaccine' for Covid-19;	1
NewsClaims	260	Mr Nikulin told the host that he was 'certain' coronavirus was a 'man-made disease' and said: 'the Americans and the British have already announced that they already have a vaccine.	1
NewsClaims	261	Kremlin-backed media has broadcast propaganda which states Covid-19, the new form of coronavirus, was created as a tool for the benefit of the UK.	1
NewsClaims	262	EXCLUSIVE: Russian media blames BRITAIN for the coronavirus outbreak: Propaganda accuses UK of 'smearing something in Wuhan' and links the virus to Salisbury novichok attack	1
NewsClaims	263	The British 'smeared something in Wuhan' in the same way that they 'smear[ed] nerve agent on Skripal's door handle';	1
NewsClaims	264	'Maybe they smeared something in Wuhan, Hubei, too, such as an escalator hand rail on the subway – something thousands of people touch daily.'	1
NewsClaims	265	Those who received PCV13 had a 35% lower incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis, 32% lower incidence of COVID-19 hospitalization and 32% lower incidence of COVID-19 death, the study showed.	1
NewsClaims	266	In contrast, an alternative pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23), which prevents severe pneumococcal disease was not associated with protection.	1
NewsClaims	267	"""One of the most interesting aspects of our findings was that the patients who received PCV13 received some protection against COVID-19, while those who received PPSV23, another pneumococcal vaccine, did not."""	1
NewsClaims	268	The genomic data cannot pinpoint the origin, but they do show that the jump from animals to humans happened recently, Koopmans says.	1
NewsClaims	269	Development of entirely new treatments has started as well.	1
NewsClaims	270	"""Now it seems clear that [the] seafood market is not the only origin of the virus,"" he wrote in an email to"	1
NewsClaims	271	That doesn't mean 2019-nCoV jumped directly from bats to humans, says evolutionary biologist Kristian Andersen of Scripps Research.	1
NewsClaims	272	Scientists don't know how long the incubation period lasts or whether infected people who show no symptoms can transmit the virus.	1
NewsClaims	273	But by 28 January, several countries had reported local human-to-human transmission, which may change the equation.	1
NewsClaims	274	"""Remdesivir has had activity against every coronavirus we've tested, and I'd be surprised if it didn't have activity against"" 2019-nCoV, says co-author Mark Denison, a virologist at Vanderbilt University."	1
NewsClaims	275	The same study showed better outcomes for remdesivir, an experimental drug made by Gilead and previously tested against Ebola that interferes with the viral polymerase enzyme.	1
NewsClaims	276	In meetings on 22 and 23 January, a special WHO committee that includes Koopmans was divided on whether a PHEIC was warranted, in part because there was no evidence the disease was spreading between people outside of China.	1
NewsClaims	277	"China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported on 26 January that a seemingly healthy man appeared to have infected ""a few colleagues."""	1
NewsClaims	278	That indicates the market played a role in spreading the virus, says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University—but he says other data suggest it wasn't the origin.	1
NewsClaims	279	"""But to be honest, we still do not know where the virus came from now."""	1
NewsClaims	280	The duo targets the protease enzyme used by HIV to copy itself, and it might thwart the coronavirus's protease as well.	1
NewsClaims	281	Lucey contends the virus was already circulating silently among humans before it contaminated the seafood market, possibly by infected animals, humans, or both.	1
NewsClaims	282	From the start, the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan—which sold mammals as well as fish—was considered a likely source of the outbreak because most of the early patients had visited it.	1
NewsClaims	283	Almost certainly from animals, but when and how are mysteries.	1
NewsClaims	284	The ideal treatment for 2019-nCoV may well be a drug like remdesivir plus monoclonal antibodies, Denison says.	1
NewsClaims	285	"""Mosquitoes do not carry COVID, but because the symptoms are so similar you’ll need to talk with your doctor to see about getting a COVID test,"" Juanette Willis, with the DeKalb County Board of Health, told FOX 5."	1
NewsClaims	286	For powerful, long-lasting immunity, a so-called live attenuated vaccine is the gold standard.	1
NewsClaims	287	That's great news for humans, because it's easy to tear open with soap or alcohol-based disinfectants.	1
NewsClaims	288	Chloroquine phosphate, used for decades to treat malaria, changes the pH level in human cells, making them less acidic—and less hospitable to certain viruses.	1
NewsClaims	289	A class of drugs called protease inhibitors, long used to treat HIV and hepatitis C, disrupt the viral replication process.	1
NewsClaims	290	Another class of medications targets an enzyme called polymerase, which strings together copies of the virus's genetic material, RNA, inside the host cell.	1
NewsClaims	291	Two promising candidates in this category—remdesivir, originally developed to treat Ebola, and favipiravir, first deployed against the flu—impersonate the building blocks of RNA and get incorporated into the chain.	1
NewsClaims	292	In rare cases, those viruses are also zoonotic, which means they can pass between humans and animals—as was the case with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory system (SARS), two severe coronaviruses in people.	1
NewsClaims	293	Initially, this novel coronavirus was believed to have started in a large seafood or wet market, suggesting animal-to-person spread, according to the CDC.	1
NewsClaims	294	But a large number of people diagnosed with the virus reportedly didn't have exposure to the wet markets, and now it's clear that the virus is primarily spreading person-to-person, says the CDC.	1
NewsClaims	295	"While experts still haven't pinpointed the actual source, new research released online by the CDC on April 21 concludes that SARS-CoV-2 ""is probably a novel recombinant virus""—one that has features closely related to coronaviruses found in bats and pangolins (scaly-skinned mammals)."	1
NewsClaims	296	However, none of the existing coronaviruses represents its immediate ancestor, notes Susanna K. P. Lau, MBBS, MD, head of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong, and colleagues, who analyzed the genome of the novel coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	297	"""Although the Wuhan market was initially suspected to be the epicenter of the epidemic, the immediate source remains elusive,"" Dr."	1
NewsClaims	298	If the Wuhan market were the source, it's possible, they say, that bats carrying the bat coronavirus were mixed in the market, enabling a new combination virus to develop.	1
NewsClaims	299	"""However, no animal samples from the market were reported to be positive,"" the team points out."	1
NewsClaims	300	"What's more, neither the first identified case in a human nor other early patients had visited the market, ""suggesting the possibility of an alternative source."""	1
NewsClaims	301	", also throws cold water on an Internet rumor that the virus may have been created in a lab: ""there is currently no evidence showing that SARS-CoV-2 is an artificial recombinant."""	1
NewsClaims	302	"""By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes,"" Kristian Andersen, PhD, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research and corresponding author on the paper, said in a statement."	1
NewsClaims	303	Andersen and colleagues' research implicates bats and possibly pangolins.	1
NewsClaims	304	", but even if bats are partly to blame, the likelihood that ""bat soup"" played a role is just an extremely misinformed (and potentially xenophobic) rumor."	1
NewsClaims	305	No, Coronavirus Was Not Caused by 'Bat Soup'–But Here's What Researchers Think May Be to Blame	1
NewsClaims	306	Since then, more than 9.6 million people worldwide have developed the infection, and at least 490,000 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's real-time tracker, which maps confirmed cases of the illness we now know as COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	307	"helping anyone: Claims that it somehow originated with one woman eating something people are referring to as ""bat soup."""	1
NewsClaims	308	The clip was reportedly met with outrage from Twitter users, who quickly began calling out Chinese eating habits as the cause of the outbreak.	1
NewsClaims	309	"No serious sources suggest China ""created"" the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has caused the COVID-19 outbreak."	1
NewsClaims	310	A recent analysis of the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus found no evidence that it was developed artificially in a lab or otherwise engineered.	1
NewsClaims	311	The virus comes from a family of viruses originating in animals that includes others such as SARS and MERS.	1
NewsClaims	312	It was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central China in late 2019 and has been rapidly spreading across the world.	1
NewsClaims	313	Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	314	Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	315	Can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?	1
NewsClaims	316	However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.	1
NewsClaims	317	No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.	1
NewsClaims	318	By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.	1
NewsClaims	319	To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).	1
NewsClaims	320	By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.	1
NewsClaims	321	The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.	1
NewsClaims	322	The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.	1
NewsClaims	323	However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.	1
NewsClaims	324	Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.	1
NewsClaims	325	There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases.	1
NewsClaims	326	From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather.	1
NewsClaims	327	Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.	1
NewsClaims	328	Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV.	1
NewsClaims	329	Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.	1
NewsClaims	330	The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.	1
NewsClaims	331	Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.	1
NewsClaims	332	To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.	1
NewsClaims	333	The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.	1
NewsClaims	334	However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	335	The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.	1
NewsClaims	336	To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes.	1
NewsClaims	337	WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.	1
NewsClaims	338	‘I see the disinfectant — where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute.	1
NewsClaims	339	The horrific incident came days after Donald Trump seemingly suggested ingesting disinfectants and ultraviolet light as a possible treatment for coronavirus last week.	1
NewsClaims	340	Man drank pint of disinfectant after Donald Trump suggested it as Covid-19 treatment	1
NewsClaims	341	‘So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light — and I think you said that hasn’t been checked but you’re going to test it,’ Trump said during a White House press conference with coronavirus task force coordinator Dr Deborah Birx.	1
NewsClaims	342	This conspiracy theory should be easy to debunk: it is biologically impossible for viruses to spread using the electromagnetic spectrum.	1
NewsClaims	343	It’s worth repeating, as the World Health Organization (WHO) points out, that viruses cannot travel on mobile networks, and that COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in many countries that do not have 5G networks.	1
NewsClaims	344	A recent variant of this conspiracy theory, particularly beloved by anti-vaccination activists, is the idea that COVID is part of a dastardly Gates-led plot to vaccinate the world’s population.	1
NewsClaims	345	The Epoch Times insists on calling COVID “the CCP virus” in all its coverage.	1
NewsClaims	346	A spicier variant is that COVID not only escaped from a lab, but it was intentionally created by Chinese scientists as a biowarfare weapon.	1
NewsClaims	347	This idea was spread initially by Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who Tweeted “it’s possible that the US military brought the virus to Wuhan.”	1
NewsClaims	348	These comments, according to Voice of America news, “echoed a rumored conspiracy, widely circulated in China, that US military personnel had brought the virus to China during their participation in the 2019 Military World Games in Wuhan last October.”	1
NewsClaims	349	In early March, Italian attorney Francesco Billota penned a bizarre article for Il Manifesto, falsely claiming that GM crops cause genetic pollution that allows viruses to proliferate due to the resulting environmental “imbalance.”	1
NewsClaims	350	Vaccines could be based on either GM attenuated viruses or use antigens produced in GM insect cell lines or plants.	1
NewsClaims	351	Alex Jones, between rants about hoaxes and the New World Order, urges viewers to buy expensive miracle pills that he claims can cure all known diseases.	1
NewsClaims	352	Dr. Mercola, a quack anti-vax and anti-GMO medic who has been banned from Google due to peddling misinformation, claims that vitamins (and numerous other products he sells) can cure or prevent COVID.	1
NewsClaims	353	Despite evidence to the contrary, nearly 3 in 10 Americans believe the coronavirus was created in a lab, according to survey results released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center.	1
NewsClaims	354	"Approximately 29% of those surveyed said the virus was ""most likely"" made in a lab, with a large share of that group (23%) saying it was done so intentionally."	1
NewsClaims	355	Only 6% of respondents said the coronavirus was created accidentally, while 43% said it most likely came about naturally.	1
NewsClaims	356	Younger adults and those with a high school diploma or a lower education level were more likely to believe that the coronavirus was made in a lab.	1
NewsClaims	357	Republicans were also more likely than Democrats to say the coronavirus was created by scientists.	1
NewsClaims	358	He suggested that it may be possible that coronavirus is a targeted biological weapon, like he said Ebola and the bird flu were, that infects some people and not others, and he said that the U.S. government may be testing a pathogenic agent it began developing in 1999.	1
NewsClaims	359	There's no evidence that taking vitamin C regularly can help prevent coronavirus or COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	360	Myth 1: The novel coronavirus was engineered in a lab in China.	1
NewsClaims	361	Because the pathogen first emerged and began infecting people in Wuhan, China, President Donald Trump has claimed—without evidence—that it started in a laboratory there.	1
NewsClaims	362	Some conspiracy theorists have even speculated it was engineered as a bioweapon, although U.S. intelligence agencies have categorically denied this possibility, stating that the intelligence community “concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.” No credible evidence has emerged to support an accidental lab release either.	1
NewsClaims	363	As Scientific American reported earlier this year, Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli—who studies bat coronaviruses and whose laboratory Trump and others had suggested was COVID-19’s source—compared the pathogen’s sequence against that of other coronaviruses her team had sampled from bat caves and found that it did not match any of them.	1
NewsClaims	364	Zhengli also explained in detail why her lab could not have been the source of the virus in a lengthy response in Science.	1
NewsClaims	365	But the evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 was not created in a lab.	1
NewsClaims	366	Myth 2: Wealthy elites intentionally spread the virus to win power and profit.	1
NewsClaims	367	Myth 5: Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment.	1
NewsClaims	368	In a tweet, Trump called the hydroxychloroquine treatment “one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,” and he has mentioned it repeatedly in his public coronavirus briefings.	1
NewsClaims	369	Several studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine does not protect against COVID-19 in those who are exposed.	1
NewsClaims	370	Myth 6: The Black Lives Matter protests led to increased transmission.	1
NewsClaims	371	A white paper analysis of protests in 315 of the largest U.S. cities by the National Bureau of Economic Research found no evidence that they led to more COVID-19 cases or deaths.	1
NewsClaims	372	Myth 8: We can achieve herd immunity by letting the virus spread through the population.	1
NewsClaims	373	Myth 4: You don’t need to wear a mask.	1
NewsClaims	374	Although early guidance on masks from the CDC and the WHO was confusing and inconsistent, there is now a strong consensus among public health authorities—supported by numerous studies—that wearing a face covering can limit the transmission of the coronavirus through small exhaled droplets.	1
NewsClaims	375	"According to American media, COVID-19 originated from China and ""was quickly spread around the world by air travelers who ran high fevers."""	1
NewsClaims	376	"The US One America News Network TV-channel (OANN) cited Greg Rubini, a US intelligence expert, who said that it ""was genetically engineered as a Bio-Weapon at the Univ."	1
NewsClaims	377	Independent analysts have spoken with numerous biologists who suggest the virus was likely created artificially.	1
NewsClaims	378	Of course, some American and mainstream media rushed to refute any arguments suggesting the virus was man-made.	1
NewsClaims	379	But researchers believe that the risk is low because donors have fully recovered from the infection.	1
NewsClaims	380	Your doctor may consider convalescent plasma therapy if you're in the hospital with COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	381	The risk of getting COVID-19 from convalescent plasma hasn't been tested yet.	1
NewsClaims	382	These can be given to people with COVID-19 to boost their ability to fight the virus.	1
NewsClaims	383	It's not yet known if convalescent plasma therapy will be an effective treatment for COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	384	However, more research is needed to determine if convalescent plasma therapy will be an effective treatment for COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	385	Convalescent plasma therapy may help people recover from COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	386	However, this therapy might help you recover from the disease.	1
NewsClaims	387	In India, the use of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure for COVID-19 is being recommended to more people.	1
NewsClaims	388	As safety concerns prompt several countries to reconsider the controversial use of a malaria drug to treat COVID-19, India’s government is recommending that front-line workers take the medicine to prevent infection.	1
NewsClaims	389	The task force says its latest decision is based on three new observational studies, conducted by government agencies, that it says show that the anti-malarial drug can prevent infection.	1
NewsClaims	390	A case-controlled study cannot determine whether the drug actually prevented infection, says Joseph Cheriyan, a clinical pharmacologist at the University of Cambridge, UK.	1
NewsClaims	391	So far, scientists have proven that the new coronavirus could not have had been created in a lab.	1
NewsClaims	392	Their analyses clearly show that the SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construction or a deliberately manipulated virus and is of animal origin.	1
NewsClaims	393	"""Our current data does not specifically pinpoint the geographical area where the virus emerged, so we cannot specifically confirm emergence in Wuhan; however, the number of early case reports and diagnostic testing is highly convincing for emergence in China in late 2019."""	1
NewsClaims	394	"""This combination of data puts viral emergence in China between October and December of 2019."	1
NewsClaims	395	Instead, Dr Tom Jefferson suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could have been lying dormant across the world until emerging under favourable environmental conditions.	1
NewsClaims	396	Earlier this month, an Oxford University professor claimed that the coronavirus may not have originated in China.	1
NewsClaims	397	Dr Rossman says that currently, the best evidence for the location and date of SARS-CoV-2 emergence into the human population comes from the early detection of positive cases in China and from the determination of cases presumed to be caused by SARS-Cov-2 through the symptoms exhibited (the study of which is called symptomology).	1
NewsClaims	398	"Dr Rossman adds that ""we know the SARS-CoV-2 virus rapidly degrades in the environment (such as on contaminated surfaces) and so it is very unlikely that the virus would be able to persist in the environment."""	1
NewsClaims	399	SHANGHAI/GENEVA (Reuters) - Doctors in Shanghai are using infusions of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the coronavirus to treat those still battling the infection, reporting some encouraging preliminary results, a Chinese professor said on Monday.	1
NewsClaims	400	“We are positive that this method can be very effective in our patients,” he said.	1
NewsClaims	401	Scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are due in weeks, while the head of a Wuhan hospital had said plasma infusions from recovered patients had shown some encouraging preliminary results.	1
NewsClaims	402	However, it is possible that the virus originated in bats and adapted to be able to cause human infection through transmission from other animals based on other similar coronaviruses.	1
NewsClaims	403	COVID-19 is a naturally occurring virus and was not made in a laboratory.	1
NewsClaims	404	But according to an April report, 13 of the 41 original cases had no link to the market — which suggests the market wasn't the origin site of the pandemic.	1
NewsClaims	405	Experts from the WHO and China conducted an investigation into the coronavirus' origins in Wuhan.	1
NewsClaims	406	Further examination of blood samples taken in 2019 could be the best way to find out when this pandemic really began.	1
NewsClaims	407	A growing body of evidence suggests the coronavirus was spreading globally months before the first cases in a Wuhan market captured global attention last December.	1
NewsClaims	408	A May investigation also led the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to rule the market out as the origin place of the outbreak.	1
NewsClaims	409	The WHO team confirmed the virus didn't make its initial jump from animals to humans at the Huanan market.	1
NewsClaims	410	The Wuhan market was not the origin of the pandemic	1
NewsClaims	411	Few people wear masks on a pier in Oceanside, California, June 22, 2020.	1
NewsClaims	412	Most likely, the market was simply the site of an early superspreader event, with one sick person infecting an atypically large number of others.	1
NewsClaims	413	"The levels go down, but less so in cases of severe infection,"" Marion Koopmans, a virologist on the WHO team, told the Wall Street Journal."	1
NewsClaims	414	Although pinpointing the exact date of the virus' first jump from animals to people is impossible without more data, these findings suggest the pandemic's December anniversary is arbitrary.	1
NewsClaims	415	"The U.S. president has at times referred to the disease as a ""Chinese virus,"" a term he said he embraced after a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman tweeted an unsubstantiated theory about U.S. Army athletes introducing the pathogen to Wuhan."	1
NewsClaims	416	"""What we know is that the ground zero for this virus was within a few miles of that lab,"" Peter Navarro, a Trump trade adviser, said Sunday on Fox News."	1
NewsClaims	417	"""If you simply do an Occam’s razor approach that the simplest explanation is probably the most likely, I think it’s incumbent on China to prove that it wasn’t that lab."""	1
NewsClaims	418	The U.S.-China blame game has helped fuel scrutiny of the Wuhan lab, which was studying bat-borne coronaviruses like the one that causes Covid-19.	1
NewsClaims	419	The facility has been the center of multiple conspiracy theories, including one that’s circulated on Chinese social media since late January that the new coronavirus escaped from the lab.	1
NewsClaims	420	Multiple posts have cited previous blunders by Chinese scientists as evidence that similar research projects haven’t been executed properly.	1
NewsClaims	421	While many Republicans have emphasized the Chinese origins of a virus that has killed more than 40,000 Americans, Cotton has been among the most vocal urging an investigation into the lab’s role.	1
NewsClaims	422	"On Friday, he told Fox News that ""circumstantial evidence"" was ""stacking up pretty quickly that this virus may have originated in those labs in Wuhan."""	1
NewsClaims	423	Although the first known cluster centered on a wet market in Wuhan, the ultimate origins of the virus remain a mystery and Chinese officials have raised the possibility that the virus didn’t begin in the country at all.	1
NewsClaims	424	Meanwhile, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, has endorsed studies that have shown the virus evolved naturally, as opposed to being genetically engineered.	1
NewsClaims	425	"Shi Zhengli -- a researcher at the institute known as ""Bat Woman"" for her expeditions in bat caves -- said in a February social media post that she would ""swear on my life"" that the virus had nothing to do with the lab."	1
NewsClaims	426	Wuhan Lab Denies Any Link to First Coronavirus Outbreak	1
NewsClaims	427	A top Wuhan laboratory official has denied any role in spreading the new coronavirus, in the most high profile response from a facility at the center of months of speculation about how the previously unknown animal disease made the leap to humans.	1
NewsClaims	428	Yuan Zhiming, director of the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, hit back at those promoting theories that the virus had escaped from the facility and caused the outbreak in the central Chinese city.	1
NewsClaims	429	"""There is absolutely no way that the virus originated from our institute,"" Yuan said in an interview Saturday with the state-run China Global Television Network."	1
NewsClaims	430	"The CDC explains this a bit more, saying ""In general, because of poor survivability of [other coronaviruses SARS and MERS] on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures."""	1
NewsClaims	431	The best way to stop the spread of the virus remains to regularly wash your hands with soap and water for twenty seconds, or if that’s not available, using a hand sanitiser that has at least 60% alcohol.	1
NewsClaims	432	"And the WHO explains that: ""The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."""	1
NewsClaims	433	"The NHS says simply ""There is currently no evidence that you can catch coronavirus from parcels and letters"", and that it’s ""very unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food."""	1
NewsClaims	434	The main way the virus spreads is believed to be from person-to-person contact.	1
NewsClaims	435	"A scientific paper surveying the available evidence on how long coronaviruses can survive on inanimate surfaces, published after the Covid-19 outbreak began, concluded that ""Human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days."""	1
NewsClaims	436	"It’s possible that the suggestion that the novel coronavirus can survive on surfaces for 28 days may stem from an article by AccuWeather, which referenced a 2010 study and said that at ""lower temperatures, the virus could survive on a stainless steel surface from 5 to 28 days""."	1
NewsClaims	437	The advice from medical bodies including the NHS, the USA’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the World Health Organisation (WHO) all say that the risk of catching the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 from a package is low, or that there’s no evidence this can happen.	1
NewsClaims	438	FACT: Studies show hydroxychloroquine does not have clinical benefits in treating COVID-19	1
NewsClaims	439	Current data shows that this drug does not reduce deaths among hospitalised COVID-19 patients, nor help people with moderate disease.	1
NewsClaims	440	Since the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), there have been widespread claims on social media that certain foods and supplements can prevent or cure COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	441	Overall, there’s no evidence indicating that foods can even affect the pH levels of blood, cells or tissues – let alone cure viral infections.	1
NewsClaims	442	However, there’s no scientific evidence that lemon can cure the disease.	1
NewsClaims	443	Coronavirus: there are no miracle foods or diets that can prevent or cure COVID-19	1
NewsClaims	444	There is also currently no existing scientific evidence demonstrating that a ketogenic diet can prevent coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	445	Lemon is a good source of vitamin C, which is important for helping immune cells work properly.	1
NewsClaims	446	"Some of the ""alkaline foods"" said to ""cure"" coronavirus were lemons, limes, oranges, turmeric tea and avocados."	1
NewsClaims	447	Though we all want to protect ourselves against COVID-19, there is currently no evidence that eating certain foods or following certain diets will protect you against coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	448	The ketogenic diet won’t prevent coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	449	"Fake news spread on social media claims ""super foods"" can cure COVID-19."	1
NewsClaims	450	Misinformation spread on social media suggests the virus can be cured by eating foods with a pH (level of acidity) that is higher than the virus’s pH.	1
NewsClaims	451	However, the BDA does advise adults living in the UK to take a daily supplement of 10 micrograms of vitamin D and eat vitamin D rich foods, like oily fish, egg yolks, and fortified breakfast cereals to ensure adequate vitamin D levels.	1
NewsClaims	452	The ketogenic (keto) diet, which is a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet, has been said to be protective against COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	453	The bottom line is that there are no miracle foods or supplements guaranteed to protect people from novel coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	454	One viral Facebook video claimed that drinking warm water with lemon slices could combat novel coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	455	Though garlic is considered to be a healthy food, there’s no evidence showing that eating it can prevent or cure COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	456	Singles out a certain food over others to protect or treat the virus	1
NewsClaims	457	The British Dietetic Association (BDA) has stated no specific food or supplements can prevent a person from catching COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	458	The coronavirus is part of the American biological war against Russia and China.	1
NewsClaims	459	"""We have been informed by Denmark of a number of persons infected with coronavirus from mink, with some genetic changes in the virus,"" WHO said in a statement emailed to Reuters in Geneva."	1
NewsClaims	460	COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark will cull its mink population of up to 17 million after a mutation of the coronavirus found in the animals spread to humans, the prime minister said on Wednesday.	1
NewsClaims	461	The head of the WHO’s emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, called on Friday for full-scale scientific investigations of the complex issue of humans - outside China - infecting mink which in turn transmitted the virus back to humans.	1
NewsClaims	462	Denmark plans to cull its mink population after coronavirus mutation spreads to humans	1
NewsClaims	463	The radiation warps the structure of their genetic material and prevents the viral particles from making more copies of themselves.	1
NewsClaims	464	As a result, a concentrated form of UVC is now on the front line in the fight against Covid-19.	1
NewsClaims	465	I.e if it is the case that the likliness of transmission of Covid-19 on equipment is low whereas the cost of the operation including H is high it may not be worthwhile.	1
NewsClaims	466	Is using UV light to kill Covid-19 effective?	1
NewsClaims	467	Banks have even been using the light to disinfect their money.	1
NewsClaims	468	A survey released by French polling institute IFOP on 6 April revealed that 59% of the French population believes chloroquine is effective against the new coronavirus.	1

NewsClaims	470	Bioweapons, secret labs, and the CIA: pro-Kremlin actors blame the U.S. for coronavirus outbreak	1
NewsClaims	471	While epidemiologists work to identify the exact source of the outbreak, officially known as 2019-nCov, pro-Kremlin actors are already blaming the United States for supposedly using bioweapons to disseminate the virus.	1
NewsClaims	472	During the Cold War, a Soviet disinformation campaign blamed the United States for the AIDS virus.	1
NewsClaims	473	"Known as Operation Infektion, the campaign began in 1983 when a little-known Indian newspaper — later exposed to be financed by the Soviet leadership — published an anonymous letter with the headline, ""AIDS May Invade India: Mystery Disease Caused by U.S."	1
NewsClaims	474	The column pushed a conspiracy theory that the virus causing AIDS was developed in an underground U.S. biological weapons lab.	1
NewsClaims	475	Narratives blaming the United States for the coronavirus outbreak first appeared on fringe pro-Kremlin outlets, and are spreading to well-established Kremlin media, Russian politicians, and social media platforms including YouTube and VKontakte (VK).	1
NewsClaims	476	Fringe pro-Kremlin outlets have accused the United States of using bioweapons against China, claiming the U.S. is using economic and military tools to pressure its competitor China.	1
NewsClaims	477	An alternate version of the narrative, disseminated by Katushya.org, states that the Chinese military is claiming the virus was artificially produced in U.S. laboratories with the goal of breaking China from within.	1
NewsClaims	478	Pro-Kremlin outlets claimed the United States was behind the spread of coronavirus in China.	1
NewsClaims	479	, the lab is one of many U.S. bases around the world for bioweapons manufacturing, implying it could be doing so again in the current outbreak.	1
NewsClaims	480	In one case he claimed the virus appeared in China because U.S. pharmaceutical companies want to cash in on the vaccine, while in the other he said the U.S. has allegedly used biological weapons against China.	1
NewsClaims	481	Russian MP Vladimir Zhirinovsky claimed the United States had economic motives for allegedly spreading the coronavirus: mostly, to undermine China’s economy.	1
NewsClaims	482	In addition to news outlets, small Russian YouTube channels are beginning to share videos which narrators discuss the coronavirus outbreak and link its appearance in China to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency as well as U.S. bioweapons research.	1
NewsClaims	483	Screenshots of YouTube videos claiming the CIA is behind the coronavirus and that it is a bioweapon of the United States.	1
NewsClaims	484	The Russian social network VK has is also being employed to spread the same disinformation narratives blaming the United States for the outbreak.	1
NewsClaims	485	Accounts on the Russian social network VK spread the same narrative of the United States being behind the coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	486	It is unknown whether these narratives blaming the United States for the coronavirus outbreak will spread alongside the outbreak itself, but it serves as a reminder of Russia’s long history of employing anti-U.S. influence operations during public health crises.	1
NewsClaims	487	MYTH: Pets will give you coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	488	We do not yet know if pets can transmit the virus to people.	1
NewsClaims	489	MYTH: Encouraging your children to practice good hand hygiene won’t make a difference	1
NewsClaims	490	Good hand hygiene is always beneficial and the most important way to prevent the spread of illness.	1
NewsClaims	491	In fact, if school-age kids use sanitizer at least four times over the course of the school day, it can reduce illness-related absences by at least 25 percent in the school.	1
NewsClaims	492	Fact check: An alkaline diet won't kill the coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	493	Though a healthy diet can help strengthen immune systems, there is not enough of an effect to stop the coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	494	The idea behind the benefits of an alkaline diet claim is that increasing the body's pH levels will create an environment that's deadly to the virus.	1
NewsClaims	495	There are no established or approved preventive measures or treatments for COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	496	"A claim posted on Facebook alleged that the pH of the coronavirus varies from 5.5 to 8.5, and ""all we need to do, to beat coronavirus,"" is eat alkaline foods above the pH levels of the virus."	1
NewsClaims	497	The idea that alkaline foods will help beat the coronavirus is also false.	1
NewsClaims	498	The claim: An alkaline diet will help beat the coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	499	"The time needed to freeze and thaw food and food packaging makes contamination with COVID-19 even less likely."""	1
NewsClaims	500	"Cornell University’s Institute for Food Safety likewise reports that ""it is extremely unlikely that any food or food packaging would be contaminated with COVID-19."	1
NewsClaims	501	"""As of now, there is no evidence of transmission from packaging, particularly frozen food packaging, to humans,"" Amira Roess, PhD, MPH, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University in Virginia, told Healthline."	1
NewsClaims	502	"""In one report, over 200,000 frozen food samples were tested for COVID-19, and one came back positive."	1
NewsClaims	503	But that genetic material only means the virus was there, not necessarily that it was still viable and active on the packaging — or in sufficient quantities to cause infection.	1
NewsClaims	504	And while it’s possible that touching an object, such as food packaging, and then touching your mouth or nose could transmit it, the virus is much more likely to be spread through the air.	1
NewsClaims	505	"Based on current data, the amount of virus found on packaging is likely not enough to pose a risk for humans,"" she added."	1
NewsClaims	506	The CDC also notes there’s no evidence of the virus spreading by eating food.	1
NewsClaims	507	For extra reassurance, Roess said people concerned about transmission via frozen food should wipe the items down as soon as they return from the grocery store, before putting them in the freezer.	1
NewsClaims	508	Can the New Coronavirus Be Transmitted by Frozen Foods?	1
NewsClaims	509	"""While it’s impossible to predict ‘zero risk’ for obtaining an infection via active virus on any particular surface, it is very unlikely and very low risk,"" Rohde said."	1
NewsClaims	510	Those handling the products before shipping or in transit should wear masks and gloves, she added.	1
NewsClaims	511	The World Health Organization has said the new coronavirus and COVID-19, the respiratory disease it causes, were unknown before the outbreak was reported in Wuhan, central China, late last year.	1
NewsClaims	512	Italy’s first COVID-19 patient was detected on Feb. 21 in a small town near Milan, in the northern region of Lombardy.	1
NewsClaims	513	This guidance includes frequently washing your hands and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that are used often.	1
NewsClaims	514	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is simply not known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	515	"""To our knowledge, this is the first free-ranging, native wild animal confirmed with SARS-CoV-2,"" Thomas DeLiberto and Susan Shriner, of the USDA’s Animal and Plant Inspection Service, said."	1
NewsClaims	516	Three companies are presently working on mink vaccines that may be ready by the spring, Hildebrandt said.	1
NewsClaims	517	At least 367 people got infected with mink variants, and 12 of those people had Cluster-5.	1
NewsClaims	518	"Epidemiologists use the term ""One Health"" to describe why investigating zoonotic disease outbreaks is critical to the health of people, livestock, wildlife, and the environment."	1
NewsClaims	519	European farms are also managed more cooperatively, which may have offered more opportunities for the farm-to-farm spread that was documented there.	1
NewsClaims	520	Some of these mutations can help the virus spread faster, worsen the severity of disease, make it harder for the body to fight, or make therapeutics or vaccines less effective.	1
NewsClaims	521	Then, in mid-December, a wild mink trapped near a Utah mink farm was confirmed to have the virus.	1
NewsClaims	522	Speed is essential for any zoonotic disease response.	1
NewsClaims	523	To limit risk of the virus spreading further, the bodies must be buried immediately, predators and scavengers kept away, the lined trucks disinfected.	1
NewsClaims	524	Currently, mink farmers are hanging onto this year’s pelts while scientists work out whether fur can spread the virus and if so how to decontaminate it.	1
NewsClaims	525	They knew mink might be susceptible, because they share some immune response similarities and a key lung receptor with people.	1
NewsClaims	526	Researchers found the virus passed from people to mink and back again, mutating as it went.	1
NewsClaims	527	In Europe, the virus had spread from farm to farm, and also jumped back to humans.	1
NewsClaims	528	"The mink almost certainly got it from farmworkers, a jump called ""reverse zoonosis."""	1

NewsClaims	547	MYTH: Sesame oil and garlic can prevent transmission of coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	548	While garlic has been shown to have some antimicrobial properties, neither garlic nor sesame oil will prevent the transmission of this virus.	1
NewsClaims	549	MYTH: Regularly rinsing your nose with saline can prevent coronavirus	1
NewsClaims	550	There is no evidence that rinsing your nose with saline can prevent coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	551	But you can help reduce your risk of catching coronavirus by following proper hand hygiene before touching your mouth, nose, or eyes, all of which have mucosal linings where the virus may enter.	1
NewsClaims	552	MYTH: Drinking liquids will wash the virus into your stomach where it will die	1
NewsClaims	553	While it is always a good idea to stay hydrated, it is definitely still possible to become infected even if you are drinking fluids.	1
NewsClaims	554	MYTH: It’s not safe to receive a package from China	1
NewsClaims	555	It is, in fact, safe to accept packages that have been shipped from China.	1
NewsClaims	556	The CDC notes that there’s a low risk of infection from products that have been shipped from areas with outbreaks because of the virus’s “low survivability on surfaces” (2019-nCoV Frequently Asked Questions, 2020).	1

NewsClaims	560	Two Studies Find That Humidity Prevents Coronavirus Spread	1
NewsClaims	561	Two independent studies have identified a useful tool for stopping the coronavirus: humid air.	1
NewsClaims	562	According to the research, dry air not only hampers our lungs’ ability to clear out respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2, but also makes it harder for our immune systems to fight it off once we’ve been infected,	1
NewsClaims	563	And on the contrary, relative humidity between 40 and 60 percent seems to make it much harder for the coronavirus to take hold — an epidemiological clue that we could weaponize against the virus.	1
NewsClaims	564	Iwasaki collaborated with Swiss physician Walter Hugentobler, who noticed that pilots and flight attendants caught the flu at unusually-high rates, eventually linking the phenomenon to extremely-dry cabin air, according to	1
NewsClaims	565	More recently, MIT engineer Hazhir Rahmandad found that COVID-19 spread more rapidly in dry regions of Iran than those with greater humidity.	1
NewsClaims	566	While the news seems to indicate that the pandemic may drop off during the summer, government leaders and the public could take that as a sign to relax protective lockdown measures and return to normal life.	1
NewsClaims	567	she’s lobbying the World Health Organization to call for greater indoor humidification as a protective measure, especially in places like nursing homes — but the organization has yet to respond.	1
NewsClaims	568	The discredited and unsubstantiated theory claims that a news programme aired in 2015 about a Chinese lab’s experiments and research on other coronaviruses was proof that the novel virus had originated in that same lab.	1
NewsClaims	569	"Salvini tweeted, in all caps, ""2015, the Chinese created a supercoronavirus with bats and mice!!!"""	1
NewsClaims	570	"A director at the Italian National Research Council (CNR) told La Repubblica: ""The current virus does not originate from the first version of Sars, and not least did it come from mice."	1
NewsClaims	571	The magazine Nature, which published the 2015 study on which the TV programme was based, has also said that the novel coronavirus did not originate in a lab.	1
NewsClaims	572	Scientists from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Queensland have developed two new drugs to both prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also treat people who have been exposed to the virus so they do not develop severe disease.	1
NewsClaims	573	"""Our drugs stop the tag from being removed and also protect the untagged ACE2 receptors from being infected."""	1
NewsClaims	574	"""Our new peptide-based drugs can keep the padlock closed and prevent infection taking hold,"" Professor Rao said."	1
NewsClaims	575	Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds, and scientists have already suggested that nCoV-2019 originally came from bats.	1
NewsClaims	576	Now, the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou says that two of its researchers have identified the pangolin as the potential source of nCoV-2019.	1
NewsClaims	577	The statement has no supporting evidence and is another example of conspiracy narratives on a plot against China, profitable to the US; on the UK which invented coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	578	As for the statement that British scientists from Porton Down laboratory put poison on the Skripals' door handle, it is not supported by any evidence.	1
NewsClaims	579	According to results published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, two-thirds of COVID-19 patients improved after taking Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir drug.	1

NewsClaims	630	Scripps Research's analysis of public genome sequence data from SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses found no evidence that the virus was made in a laboratory or otherwise engineered	1
NewsClaims	631	The analysis of public genome sequence data from SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses found no evidence that the virus was made in a laboratory or otherwise engineered.	1
NewsClaims	632	"""By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes,"" said Kristian Andersen, PhD, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research and corresponding author on the paper."	1
NewsClaims	633	The resulting genomic sequence data has shown that Chinese authorities rapidly detected the epidemic and that the number of COVID-19 cases have been increasing because of human to human transmission after a single introduction into the human population.	1
NewsClaims	634	The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was so effective at binding the human cells, in fact, that the scientists concluded it was the result of natural selection and not the product of genetic engineering.	1
NewsClaims	635	"""These two features of the virus, the mutations in the RBD portion of the spike protein and its distinct backbone, rules out laboratory manipulation as a potential origin for SARS-CoV-2"" said Andersen."	1

NewsClaims	637	The researchers proposed bats as the most likely reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 as it is very similar to a bat coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	638	A coronavirus from a pangolin could possibly have been transmitted to a human, either directly or through an intermediary host such as civets or ferrets.	1
NewsClaims	639	However, clinical data are still very limited and inconclusive, and the beneficial effects of these medicines in COVID-19 have not been demonstrated.	1

NewsClaims	641	Taking low-dose aspirin may reduce ICU admissions and in-hospital deaths of COVID-19 patients, according to a new study.	1
NewsClaims	642	While this is reassuring, it’s also important to remind patients that there is NO evidence that elderberry can help treat or prevent COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	643	Overall, there is no strong evidence that elderberry can cause cytokine storm syndrome, but there’s also no good evidence that it can improve symptoms or prevent COVID-19.	1
NewsClaims	644	CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article claimed a laboratory near Wuhan could be to blame for the outbreak of coronavirus.	1
NewsClaims	645	This has since been disputed, with the source said to be an animal market	1
NewsClaims	646	China's deadly coronavirus outbreak was linked to a secret lab created to study the world's most dangerous diseases, insiders claimed.	1
NewsClaims	647	However the sources of the outbreak is said to be at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan - not a lab.	1
NewsClaims	648	Yesterday, coronavirus was linked to bats after the first cases were traced back to a food market in the city.	1
NewsClaims	649	Scientists said the flying mammals could host the virus.	1
NewsClaims	650	The outbreak has also been linked to eating venomous snakes, which were also seen at the food market.	1
NewsClaims	651	The claim: The coronavirus may have originated in a Chinese laboratory.	1
NewsClaims	652	One of the most prominent initial reports on the virus is an article published in January 2020 by the right-leaning Washington Times that suggests the coronavirus may have originated in a research laboratory in Wuhan, China.	1
NewsClaims	653	Related:WHO says coronavirus came from an animal and was not made in a lab	1
NewsClaims	654	More:Fact check: Coronavirus originated in China, not elsewhere, researchers and studies say	1
NewsClaims	655	"They concluded it does not show signs of having been manufactured or purposefully manipulated in a lab, though the exact origin remains murky and experts debate whether it may have leaked from a Chinese lab that was studying it."""	1
NewsClaims	656	Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., has suggested to Congress and Fox News that there may be a connection between the Wuhan lab and the origin of the virus.	1
NewsClaims	657	What researchers say: COVID-19 likely originated in nature	1
NewsClaims	658	Medical journals have pointed toward animals in nature as the origin of the virus.	1
NewsClaims	659	"""It is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin,"" WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said."	1
NewsClaims	660	On April 21, the World Health Organization noted at a briefing that available evidence indicates coronavirus originated in animals in China late last year and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory as has been alleged.	1
NewsClaims	661	Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, said earlier this year in an interview with The Washington Post: “Based on the virus genome and properties, there is no indication whatsoever that it was an engineered virus.”	1
NewsClaims	662	The Scripps Research Institute released a study that rejects the notion that the virus was man-made.	1
NewsClaims	663	A statement in the Lancet, a medical journal, written by public health officials who have been following the progression of the virus also asserted that animals are the likely source: “Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife.”	1
NewsClaims	664	Another study published in the Lancet found results based on samples collected from nine patients who had contracted the virus corroborated the theory that the virus had come from bats.	1
NewsClaims	665	Although scientists say they believe bats were likely the original host, it’s also very possible, the study notes, that the virus was transferred from a bat to another animal that may have been at the seafood market in Wuhan.	1
NewsClaims	666	While experts agree the virus came from nature, its origins beyond that remain unclear.	1
NewsClaims	667	One scenario has the virus occurring naturally – from a bat, say – but accidentally escaping the research facility because of poor safety protocols.	1
NewsClaims	668	Anthony Fauci, the U.S.'s top infectious disease expert, was dismissive of the theory of an accidental escape from a Chinese laboratory, USA TODAY reported on April 18.	1
NewsClaims	669	But two administration officials with knowledge of the investigation, speaking to USA TODAY on condition of anonymity because it is classified and sensitive, said they have always questioned China's account of how the virus originated and have taken seriously suggestions that it may have resulted from a lab accident that the Chinese are covering up.	1
NewsClaims	670	"But even as of Jan. 15, 2021, its origins are unclear, as described in this State Department statement: ""The U.S. government does not know exactly where, when, or how the COVID-19 virus — known as SARS-CoV-2 — was transmitted initially to humans."	1
NewsClaims	671	We rate the claim that COVID-19 may have originated in a Chinese lab as PARTLY FALSE.	1
NewsClaims	672	Suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons in a high-security biomedical laboratory in Wuhan, China, were debunked, based on scientific research since the virus began its global spread.	1
NewsClaims	673	Investigations continue into where COVID-19 began, and no conclusions can be drawn, nor has evidence been presented, that definitively explains the pathogen’s origin.	1
NewsClaims	674	Circumstantial evidence suggests the virus could have escaped from the Wuhan lab due to a lapse in safety measures.	1
NewsClaims	675	"While the authors of the study have demonstrated that the virus can ""survive the time and temperatures associated with transportation and storage conditions associated with the international food trade,"" the potential for contamination of food with infectious virus may be possible."	1
NewsClaims	676	It’s a hypothesis that the authors have advanced, without definitive evidence of transmission at this point in time.	1
NewsClaims	677	Even if you were to consume food containing infectious virus, the acidity of your stomach would likely kill the virus instantly, making it a non-issue in terms of infectious spread within your body.	1
NewsClaims	678	And rightfully so, since the main mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is droplet-spread, person-to-person, and not by surfaces or even fomites.	1
NewsClaims	679	"The CDC has stated that ""currently there is no evidence to suggest that handling food or consuming food is associated with Covid-19."""	1
NewsClaims	680	And, of course this should include meticulous attention to hand hygiene, cleaning of utensils, material and food contact surfaces.	1
NewsClaims	681	The authors of the new study hypothesize that workers in meat processing plants could potentially be a vector for spread of the virus, following exposure to the infected meat that that was previously frozen in other countries.	1
NewsClaims	682	iv found that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for Covid-19, can survive on frozen meat and fish for periods up to 3 weeks, as researchers continue to explore the possibility that contaminated food could be the source of new outbreaks in countries which had previously controlled the virus.	1
NewsClaims	683	"It does, however, argue that efforts to reduce the risk of Covid-19 outbreaks ""seeded by contaminated food must begin at the source; that is food processing premises,"" as the authors state."	1
NewsClaims	684	That said, the contribution from poor working conditions (crowding, poor ventilation, lack of PPE, and shouting due to elevated ambient noise levels) along with contact with other infected workers who report to work—may also be responsible for spread of the virus.	1
NewsClaims	685	Covid-19 Coronavirus Can Survive On Frozen Meat And Fish For Up To 3 Weeks, Study Finds	1
NewsClaims	686	As a result, the potential for infectivity—possessing a high enough viral load which is then capable of transmission to a person—after eating the particular food is quite remote.	1
NewsClaims	687	Thus far, there is no need to be overly concerned, as health officials in Shenzen or Yantai have yet to find any credible threat from these food-borne sources.	1
NewsClaims	688	"Moreover, the WHO has also issued a statement on food safety and handling explaining that ""it is highly unlikely that people can contract Covid-19 from food or food packaging."""	1
NewsClaims	689	In light of the new information obtained from the study, people should still realize that the risk of catching the virus from exposure to, or eating previously refrigerated or frozen meat and fish is theoretical at best.	1

NewsClaims	710	It appears that the virus is becoming more transmissible between humans.	1
NewsClaims	711	Owing to a shortage of specific treatments and considering the relatedness of 2019-nCoV to SARS-CoV, some drugs and pre-clinical vaccines against SARS-CoV could probably be used to treat this virus.	1

NewsClaims	713	While the pro-Kremlin media has been pushing all sorts of different and often contradictory narratives – ranging from bizarre conspiracy theories, to Ukraine responding inadequately to the pandemic, to the West either failing to react or reacting hysterically – the articles that saw the biggest engagement numbers all claimed that the virus was manufactured by the United States.	1

NewsClaims	802	Explications	0
NewsClaims	803	1 _ The Institut Pasteur did not invent Covid-19 or the virus responsible for it, SARS-CoV-2!	0
NewsClaims	804	We would remind you that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, responsible for the current Covid-19 pandemic, is different from the SARS-CoV-1 virus that caused an outbreak in South-East Asia in 2003.	0
NewsClaims	805	It is scientifically false to say that they are genetically identical in every way or that the only difference in their sequence lies in a few elements allegedly derived from the HIV genome sequence..	0
NewsClaims	806	"See below ""No, SARS-CoV-2 wasn't created from HIV in a laboratory!"""	0
NewsClaims	807	These two viruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, do both belong to the coronavirus family (which also includes other viruses) but are two separate viruses.	0
NewsClaims	808	The Institut Pasteur did not invent any viruses (neither SARS-CoV-2 nor SARS-CoV-1) but, in 2004, did invent a vaccine candidate for the previous coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-1.	0
NewsClaims	809	"See below ""The Institut Pasteur did not invent Covid-19 or the virus responsible for it, SARS-CoV-2!"""	0
NewsClaims	810	This vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-1 was the subject of a patent application filed in 2004, which mentions a particular strain of the SARS-CoV-1 virus, which was itself discovered and described in March 2003, i.e.	0
NewsClaims	811	several months before the patent was filed.	0
NewsClaims	812	At the time, the Institut Pasteur proposed several strategies that could enable development of a vaccine (those described in the patent), which included a vaccine based on the virus used in the measles vaccine and another one based on a lentiviral vector.	0
NewsClaims	813	These two scientific approaches to develop a vaccine candidate, proposed for the SARS-CoV-1 virus at the time, are today the subject of new research to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Covid-19 pandemic (new avenues measles vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; lentiviral vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine).	0
NewsClaims	814	It should be noted that the vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-1 was successfully tested on an animal model for the 2002-2003 SARS epidemics(disease caused by SARS-CoV-1 virus) outbreak at the time.	0
NewsClaims	815	But this vaccine candidate was neither ever tested on humans nor marketed as the outbreak had thankfully ended.	0
NewsClaims	816	2 _ The Institut Pasteur did not release any viruses in the city of Wuhan in China!	0
NewsClaims	817	It is false and slanderous to assert that the Institut Pasteur released the coronavirus in the city of Wuhan in China.	0
NewsClaims	818	"The ""BSL-4 laboratory"" in Wuhan, which is mentioned in this video, is a research institute that strictly depends on the Chinese authorities and one with which the Institut Pasteur has no scientific interaction."	0

NewsClaims	859	The Indian paper, initially published without peer review (as is the norm for this type of open science website), was strongly criticized by the scientific community for its approximations and subsequently withdrawn by the authors themselves because of the methodological errors that had been flagged up by their peers.	0
NewsClaims	860	The open science website bioRxiv now displays a banner qindicating that the articles it hosts have not been peer reviewed (see also the column Les Décodeurs, in Le Monde - in French).	0
NewsClaims	861	3 _ An article published in Nature Medicine has since confirmed that there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could have been created by humans	0

NewsClaims	867	A recurring suspicion about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, held by conspiracy groups, is that it is linked to the presence of a P4 laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the virus first appeared.	0
NewsClaims	868	According to conspiracy groups, SARS-CoV-2 was spread when a bat, on which tests had been performed, escaped, and the Institut Pasteur was linked to this.	0
NewsClaims	869	This is completely false.	0
NewsClaims	870	There are four things to remember:	0
NewsClaims	871	There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was created by humans.	0
NewsClaims	872	The P4 laboratory in the city of Wuhan, where the virus SARS-CoV-2 first appeared, has nothing to do with the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai (IPS).	0
NewsClaims	873	This hearsay has no link with the previous work of the Institut Pasteur (Paris) on SARS-CoV-1, the coronavirus that appeared in China in 2002-2003.	0

NewsClaims	883	2 _ The Institut Pasteur of Shanghai (IPS) did not work on coronaviruses in the P4 laboratory in Wuhan, which is associated with a Chinese institute.	0
NewsClaims	884	Scientific collaboration with China, on the most dangerous pathogens (referred to as “class 4,” denoting pathogens that can only be the object of research in extremely secure laboratories, designated as “P4”), and on emerging viruses, fits into the context of a French-Chinese agreement for preventing and combatting emerging infectious viruses, signed in Peking on October 9, 2004.	0
NewsClaims	885	It also fits into the context of the International Health Regulations of 2005, which entered into affect after the agreement, that uphold the principle of containment at source in the battle against infectious diseases.	0
NewsClaims	886	This intergovernmental collaboration directed:	0
NewsClaims	887	Firstly, the construction of the National laboratory of high-security biological containment (a P4 laboratory), in Wuhan on the campus of the Virology Institut of Wuhan (VIW).	0

NewsClaims	892	The P4 laboratory was indeed planned and constructed with the help of France, in the context of the cooperation agreement of 2004.	0
NewsClaims	893	However, the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai (IPS) is absolutely an independent and distinct Franco-Chinese institut​	0
NewsClaims	894	Regarding the alleged work of the Shanghai Pasteur Institute (IPS) on the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	895	Since the emergence of the nouvel coronavirus in Wuhan, the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai (IPS), in line with its mandate, fulfilled its role as a cooperative Franco-Chinese platform, facilitating a better understanding of the evolution of the new virus.	0
NewsClaims	896	It published, as early as the first weeks, an article about the three-dimensional structure of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	897	Its scientific experts furthermore proposed their services to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the Virology Institut of Wuhan, to help the on-site staff, but they were not contacted.​	0
NewsClaims	898	The IPS has neither active projects inside the P4 laboratory in Wuhan, nor active projets in any of the P3 laboratories in Wuhan.	0
NewsClaims	899	The IPS thus brought its active support to other institutes in the Asia region (Hong Kong, Laos, and Cambodia, primarily) and mobilized itself to help preparations in the most vulnerable countries (including African institutes.)	0
NewsClaims	900	3 _ The Institut Pasteur (Paris) indeed conducted research in France on a previous coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), which has nothing to do with SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19.	0
NewsClaims	901	The Institut Pasteur (Paris) indeed conducted research in France, between 2002 and 2004, on a preceding coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) which was the cause of the 2003 epidemic.	0
NewsClaims	902	Furthermore, in 2004 the Institut created a vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-1.	0
NewsClaims	903	The construction of the P4 laboratory of Wuhan began in 2011 and was inaugurated in 2017, which is to say, a dozen years after the invention disclosure that was touted as evidence in the conspiracy theory video.	0

NewsClaims	923	The 2004 patent described the discovery of the virus and the subsequent invention of a vaccine strategy against the virus – and NOT the invention of the virus itself!	0
NewsClaims	924	The vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-1 was not tested on humans because, by the time it was ready, the outbreak had fortunately come to an end and there were no more patients to test it on.	0

NewsClaims	932	Remdesivir Likely Effective Antiviral for SARS-CoV-2	0
NewsClaims	933	The lack of effective antiviral drugs against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a glaring issue since the beginning of the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	934	Investigators and physicians alike have been searching for a potential therapy that can fill this much needed role.	0
NewsClaims	935	Early on, there were hopes that remdesivir, which was originally developed to treat hepatitis C and later found effective against Ebola, could be used as an antiviral against COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	936	However, a large clinical trial showed results which were inconclusive, and the World Health Organization subsequently announced that remdesivir did not significantly reduce mortality rates.	0
NewsClaims	937	However, the investigators behind the case report believed the issue to be much more complicated and decided to pursue it more thoroughly.	0
NewsClaims	938	The case report, published in	0
NewsClaims	939	Nature Communications	0
NewsClaims	940	, approached the use of remdesivir as an antiviral agent differently to determine its effects in a closely monitored patient with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	941	The patient was a 31-year-old man with the rare genetic condition XLA, which impacts the body's ability to produce antibodies and fight infections.	0
NewsClaims	942	The patient reported a fever, coughing and vomiting and was later diagnosed with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	943	After 30 days of persistent symptoms, he was admitted to a hospital and given supplemental oxygen.	0
NewsClaims	944	The investigators implemented a 10-day course of remdesivir and within 36 hours, they observed a dramatic improvement in his symptoms.	0
NewsClaims	945	The clinical response to remdesivir was accompanied by a progressive decrease in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which is produced by the liver in response to inflammation.	0
NewsClaims	946	Doctors also observed an increase in the number of lymphocytes, and performed chest scans that showed clearing of lung inflammation.	0
NewsClaims	947	The patient was discharged from the hospital on day 43 but was readmitted and again tested positive for COVID-19 on day 54.	0
NewsClaims	948	Another course of remdesivir was administered, followed by convalescent plasma therapy on day 69 and 70.	0
NewsClaims	949	He was released 3 days later and has since been symptom free.	0
NewsClaims	950	"""Our patient's unusual condition gave us a rare insight into the effectiveness of remdesivir as a treatment for coronavirus infection,"" Nicholas Matheson, a physician at the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease said."	0
NewsClaims	951	The team suspects that remdesivir should be employed early on in the course of the disease, as this is when it is likely to be most beneficial.	0
NewsClaims	952	They also suggest that the use of the therapy should be tailored to each individual patient depending on underlying conditions.	0

NewsClaims	983	Ebright described a December video from the Wuhan CDC that shows staffers “collecting bat coronaviruses with inadequate [personal protective equipment] and unsafe operational practices.” Separately, I reviewed two Chinese articles, from 2017 and 2019, describing the heroics of Wuhan CDC researcher Tian Junhua, who while capturing bats in a cave “forgot to take protective measures” so that “bat urine dripped from the top of his head like raindrops.”	0
NewsClaims	984	And then there’s the Chinese study that was curiously withdrawn.	0
NewsClaims	985	In February, a site called ResearchGate published a brief article by Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao from Guangzhou’s South China University of Technology.	0
NewsClaims	986	“In addition to origins of natural recombination and intermediate host, the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.	0
NewsClaims	987	Safety level may need to be reinforced in high risk biohazardous laboratories,” the article concluded.	0

NewsClaims	993	Quick Take	0
NewsClaims	994	Several online stories inaccurately claim that the new coronavirus contains HIV “insertions” and shows signs of being created in a lab.	0
NewsClaims	995	But there is no evidence that the new virus was bioengineered, and every indication it came from an animal.	0
NewsClaims	996	Full Story	0
NewsClaims	997	We’ve seen similar claims before, but this time many claims are being fueled by an unpublished — and highly dubious — scientific paper.	0
NewsClaims	998	By delving into the genetic or protein sequences of the virus, many of these stories have an aura of scientific credibility.	0
NewsClaims	999	But scientists who study viruses say they are incorrect.	0
NewsClaims	1000	One set of stories, subsequently shared on Facebook, inaccurately asserts a link between the new coronavirus, also known as 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, and HIV, largely based on an unpublished manuscript by scientists in India.	0
NewsClaims	1001	The paper, which was posted on the preprint website bioRxiv (pronounced “bio-archive”) on Jan. 31, claimed to have identified very short “insertions” in the virus’ protein sequence that had an “uncanny similarity” to HIV.	0
NewsClaims	1002	Numerous scientists, however, almost immediately pointed out flaws in the analysis, noting that the sequences are so short, they match a bevy of other organisms — and there’s no reason to conclude they derive from HIV.	0
NewsClaims	1003	The paper was voluntarily withdrawn by its authors just two days later, with one saying, “It was not our intention to feed into the conspiracy theories and no such claims are made here.”	0
NewsClaims	1004	But the speedy withdrawal wasn’t fast enough to prevent some websites from picking up the story and concluding that the new coronavirus had been crafted in a laboratory.	0
NewsClaims	1005	A ZeroHedge article with the headline, “Coronavirus Contains ‘HIV Insertions,’ Stoking Fears Over Artificially Created Bioweapon,” pounced on some of the language in the preprint to argue that the scientists were saying the virus might be “man-made.” The story also cited tweets from a visiting scientist at Harvard who had commented on the preprint and stated that the scientist’s tweets suggested that the virus “might have been genetically engineered for the purposes of a weapon.”	0
NewsClaims	1006	ZeroHedge is a website that we’ve written about before, including for spreading the false idea that the new coronavirus was stolen from a lab in Canada and then weaponized by the Chinese government.	0
NewsClaims	1007	Originally published the same day of the preprint, the ZeroHedge article was updated the following day to include tweets from the Harvard visiting scientist, who by then had seen some of the criticisms of the preprint and was now advocating for additional studies to be done before jumping to any conclusions.	0
NewsClaims	1008	The Harvard scientist, it should be said, is an epidemiologist, health economist and nutritionist, and does not have expertise in virology or bioinformatics.	0
NewsClaims	1009	The bulk of the article, however, remains unchanged.	0
NewsClaims	1010	Well after the preprint was withdrawn, a website that traffics in vaccine misinformation, Health Impact News, also highlighted the invalid HIV connection.	0
NewsClaims	1011	Separately, a blogger posted a different bogus analysis — also making the rounds on Facebook — that posits a portion of the new coronavirus genome is similar to part of a viral vector that was used in previous research on the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus.	0
NewsClaims	1012	Based on this, the author argues that the new virus could have leaked from a Chinese lab working on a vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	1013	The SARS virus caused a global outbreak in 2003 and is similar but distinct from 2019-nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	1014	Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind InfoWars and the false idea that the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 was a hoax, also waded into the coronavirus misinformation pool.	0
NewsClaims	1015	Scientists with expertise in viral genomics, however, say that no such evidence exists.	0
NewsClaims	1016	Kristian Andersen, the director of infectious disease genomics at the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told us in an email that in both cases, the analyses are “completely wrong.”	0
NewsClaims	1017	The HIV study, he said, was a “misunderstanding of how to perform these types of analyses” that also cherry-picked its findings.	0
NewsClaims	1018	The short proteins the Indian scientists found to be similar to HIV are not from HIV at all, Andersen said, but are the result of the natural evolution of coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	1019	“Had the authors compared nCoV to related bat viruses (and not just SARS as they did),” he wrote, “they would have realized that the peptides are also present in the bat viruses — and most certainly don’t come from HIV.”	0
NewsClaims	1020	Indeed, other experts have noted the same shortcomings, including Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who performed the proper sequence alignments and shared the results in a Twitter thread.	0
NewsClaims	1021	He found that all of the so-called “insertions” appear in a bat virus identified from a cave in Yunnan, China — or were artifacts of improper alignment.	0
NewsClaims	1022	Only one “insertion” is not fully shared with the bat virus, Bedford explained, and “in no way suggests engineering” since it is consistent with the types of insertions and deletions that happen in coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	1023	“There is absolutely no evidence for either (1) sequence insertions or (2) their relationship to HIV,” he concluded.	0
NewsClaims	1024	The vector, he said, was used to understand coronaviruses and develop vaccines — but is different from 2019nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	1025	“While they’re similar (like worms and people are similar) there is absolutely no way that nCoV is in any way related,” he said.	0
NewsClaims	1026	“If one were to look at the two genomes side by side, it’s very easy to show that they’re obviously not the same — or that one somehow led to the other.”	0
NewsClaims	1027	HIV Drugs	0
NewsClaims	1028	As we’ve just established, there’s no connection between HIV and the new coronavirus, but the fact that some countries are using HIV drugs to treat the new coronavirus is included in many of the social media posts to lend credence to the bogus theory.	0
NewsClaims	1029	One Facebook post says, “Ask yourself why they have been treating with HIV drugs from the start,” and the ZeroHedge story proclaims, “The virus even responds to treatment by HIV medications.”	0
NewsClaims	1030	In fact, it’s not yet clear if the virus does respond to HIV drugs — but the rationale to try it is pretty simple.	0
NewsClaims	1031	Timothy Sheahan, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told us in a phone interview that there aren’t that many FDA-approved antiviral drugs, so when a new virus emerges, doctors just give patients “whatever they think might help.”	0
NewsClaims	1032	Many existing antivirals, he said, are HIV medications, so it’s natural to turn to those.	0
NewsClaims	1033	And there is some precedent for HIV drugs possibly working against coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	1034	During the SARS outbreak, for example, scientists performed a drug screen and identified the HIV drug cocktail of lopinavir and ritonavir as having potential antiviral activity against SARS.	0
NewsClaims	1035	That drug combo was also associated with better outcomes among a small group of SARS patients, although it was never tested in a clinical trial, so it’s hard to say if it was truly effective.	0
NewsClaims	1036	It is also currently being tested in a clinical trial in Saudi Arabia against another disease caused by a coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.	0
NewsClaims	1037	Sheahan, however, is skeptical that HIV drugs will be very effective against the new virus.	0
NewsClaims	1038	The levels of the drug that are likely required to diminish viral replication, he said, “are not achievable” in people.	0
NewsClaims	1039	And in his experiments against the MERS virus in cell culture and in mice, he found lopinavir and ritonavir offered little improvement in severe lung disease or viral replication.	0
NewsClaims	1040	No Signs of Bioengineering	0
NewsClaims	1041	As for the general notion that the virus has been bioengineered, there’s no evidence that’s true.	0
NewsClaims	1042	On the contrary, as we’ve explained before, all lines of evidence point to the virus coming from an animal.	0
NewsClaims	1043	That’s consistent with what scientists have learned about the ecology of coronaviruses in the last 20 years, Sheahan said, including SARS and MERS — and it fits with the fact that the virus shares 96% of its genome with a bat virus.	0
NewsClaims	1044	And not only are there no HIV “insertions” in the virus, but by looking at the virus’ genome, scientists also see zero signs of human tampering.	0
NewsClaims	1045	Bedford, the Fred Hutchinson computational biologist, pointed out on Twitter that the virus’ genetic differences to its most recent common ancestor are “consistent with differences expected to arise during natural evolution.”	0
NewsClaims	1046	An engineered virus, he explained, would likely have a “distorted” amino acid to nucleotide ratio, and also have changes focused in on a “subset of genes.” In other words, when engineering occurs, it’s usually to bring about a meaningful change to the virus — but there’s no evidence of that in the 2019-nCoV genome.	0
NewsClaims	1047	Typically, scientists change nucleotides in a targeted way to create changes in the amino acids they code for.	0
NewsClaims	1048	Since amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, that’s the way to change the proteins the virus produces.	0
NewsClaims	1049	But as Bedford said, out of all the nucleotide changes, relatively few — around 14% — alter the corresponding amino acid, or about what you would expect in a naturally evolving virus.	0
NewsClaims	1050	This ratio also matches that of the bat virus that’s found to be the most similar to 2019-nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	1051	Further, when comparing the amino acid changes that do exist, the number of changes in the respective genes in both 2019-nCoV and the bat virus are highly similar.	0
NewsClaims	1052	Again, if the virus had been engineered, one might expect many of the changes to cluster in one or two genes, but that’s not the case here.	0
NewsClaims	1053	All of this argues against the idea of the new virus having come out of a lab.	0

NewsClaims	1154	The first peptide-based drug would be given pre-exposure to the virus and help boost the efficacy of vaccines, while the second drug would stop the spread of the virus in already infected cells.	0
NewsClaims	1155	The discovery of the peptide-based drugs was made possible after the researchers uncovered a previously unknown mode of entry that SARS-CoV-2 exploits to invade cells and cause COVID-19 disease.	0
NewsClaims	1156	Laboratory tests show the first peptide-based drug reduces infection by cloaking the ACE2 receptor protein on human cells.	0
NewsClaims	1157	The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein uses the ACE2 receptor to bind to and invade cells.	0
NewsClaims	1158	The virus then latches onto the cloaking peptides, which they mistake for human cells—preventing infection.	0

NewsClaims	1160	It also boosts the immune system's ability to recognise the virus.	0
NewsClaims	1161	Senior researcher and head of QIMR Berghofer's Gene Regulation and Translational Medicine Group, Professor Sudha Rao, said they were able to develop the drugs after discovering that some people have a chemical tag which acts like a padlock on the ACE2 receptor.	0
NewsClaims	1162	"""The tag can either keep the receptor locked or open—controlling infection."	0
NewsClaims	1163	"This means people who have the 'padlock-like' tag on their ACE2 receptors will be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and those without the tag are more vulnerable to infection,"" Professor Rao said."	0
NewsClaims	1164	The researchers also discovered that if the virus invaded the cells it would unlock the tag from the inside—allowing more efficient virus replication.	0
NewsClaims	1165	"""These are the first drugs we are aware of that can operate on dual fronts."	0
NewsClaims	1166	"We hope, if the clinical trials are successful, that the first drug could be given as a therapy alongside vaccination to prevent the virus binding to cells and taking hold, while the second peptide could be used to stop the virus replicating in already-infected patients."""	0
NewsClaims	1167	The research was conducted on COVID-19 patient blood and human cells.	0

NewsClaims	1169	"""Many of the drugs being developed around the world to treat COVID-19 are targeted at people with severe disease."	0
NewsClaims	1170	"However, these peptide-based drugs are aimed at preventing infection in the first place, and at reducing the severity of the disease before it really takes hold,"" Professor Seddiki said."	0
NewsClaims	1171	"""These drugs could also be very important because they may provide the protection we need for emerging variants and be used to protect the small group of people who cannot be vaccinated."""	0

NewsClaims	1173	"""IDMIT are world leaders in clinical trials and, particularly, tests of potential COVID-19 drugs."	0

NewsClaims	1227	A number of sources suggest that freezing temperatures do not kill the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	1228	Four questions came to City Limits: Coronavirus asking whether the virus can be neutralized by freezing it.	0
NewsClaims	1229	Some researchers point to a 2010 study on two viruses related to the COVID-19 virus as an indication that those viruses survived longer in lower temperatures but don’t address freezing in particular.	0
NewsClaims	1230	And the Journal of Applied and Environmental Microbiology cites the 2010 study, which looks at the effects of temperature and humidity on viral survival.	0
NewsClaims	1231	The 2010 study found, in fact, that the virus survived longer in both lower temperatures and lower humidity.	0
NewsClaims	1232	"The journal article also said research done in 2006 ""expected"" the viruses studied would survive being frozen."	0
NewsClaims	1233	A Washington, D.C.,-based nonprofit called the Federation of American Scientists report the same conclusions.	0
NewsClaims	1234	It states:	0
NewsClaims	1235	"""Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments."	0

NewsClaims	1393	Former White House strategist Steve Bannon repeated a similar claim on Fox News in March.	0
NewsClaims	1394	And opinion columnist Steven Mosher touted the idea in the New York Post in February.	0

NewsClaims	1396	Researchers have been racing to learn about the virus since it was recognized in December 2019 as a new strain.	0
NewsClaims	1397	The Washington Post reported most countries have abandoned their bioweapons programs after years of work did not yield satisfactory results.	0
NewsClaims	1398	Researchers concluded that if the virus were engineered, its genome sequence would more closely resemble earlier and more serious versions of the coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	1399	“If someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness,” the report said.	0
NewsClaims	1400	“But the scientists found that the SARS-CoV-2 backbone differed substantially from those of already known coronaviruses and mostly resembled related viruses found in bats and pangolins.”	0

NewsClaims	1402	These sources include the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Nature; U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine; the New England Journal of Medicine; the Chinese Medical Journal; and the medical journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution.	0
NewsClaims	1403	Researchers who analyzed the genome of the coronavirus found its sequence shared a very high resemblance to a coronavirus in bats, but it's possible other animals may have been involved in the transmission process.	0
NewsClaims	1404	“2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus,” a study published in the science journal Nature said.	0
NewsClaims	1405	Researchers concluded the genome sequences of the coronavirus “was closely related … to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses.”	0
NewsClaims	1406	This is based on circumstantial evidence such as the Wuhan Institute of Virology's history of studying coronaviruses in bats, the lab's proximity to where some of the infections were first diagnosed and China's lax safety record in its labs.	0

NewsClaims	1415	The disinformation campaign promotes unfounded conspiracy theories that the US is behind the new coronavirus outbreak, in an apparent bid to damage America’s image around the world.	0
NewsClaims	1416	State department officials tasked with combatting Russian disinformation told Agence France-Presse (AFP) false personas were being used on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to advance Russian talking points in multiple languages.	0
NewsClaims	1417	“Russia’s intent is to sow discord and undermine US institutions and alliances from within, including through covert and coercive malign influence campaigns,” said Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia.	0

NewsClaims	1426	The US has tested more than 400 people and found 14 confirmed cases, mostly linked to travelers.	0
NewsClaims	1427	A similar outbreak in 2003 involved the Sars virus, which was thought to have come from bats.	0
NewsClaims	1428	Experts said the coronavirus disinformation campaign has parallels with previous conspiracy theories traced to Moscow, including a KGB disinformation campaign in the 1980s that convinced many around the world that US scientists created the HIV virus that causes Aids.	0
NewsClaims	1429	Several thousand online accounts – previously identified for airing Russian-backed messages on major events such as the war in Syria, the Yellow Vest protests in France and Chile’s mass demonstrations – are posting “near identical” messages about the coronavirus, according to a report prepared for the state department’s Global Engagement Center and seen by AFP.	0
NewsClaims	1430	The accounts are run by humans, not bots, and post at similar times in English, Spanish, Italian, German and French.	0
NewsClaims	1431	They can be linked back to Russian proxies, or carry messages similar to Russian-backed outlets such as RT and Sputnik, the report said.	0
NewsClaims	1432	“In this case, we were able to see their full disinformation ecosystem in effect, including state TV, proxy websites and thousands of false social media personas all pushing the same themes,” said Lea Gabrielle, the head of the Global Engagement Center, which is tasked with tracking and exposing propaganda and disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	1433	The US believes the Russian disinformation campaign is making it harder to respond to the epidemic, particularly in Africa and Asia, as some of the public has become suspicious of the western response.	0
NewsClaims	1434	The WHO warned on Friday that the window to stem the global outbreak was narrowing, voicing alarm at a surge of cases with no clear link to China.	0
NewsClaims	1435	A state official said Russian operatives appeared to have been given “carte blanche” to attack the US.	0

NewsClaims	1448	“It is a very important area to pursue,” Ryan said.	0
NewsClaims	1449	“Because what hyperimmune globulin does is it concentrates the antibodies in a recovered patient.	0
NewsClaims	1450	You are essentially giving the new victim’s immune system a boost of antibodies to hopefully get them through the very difficult phase.	0
NewsClaims	1451	“So it must be given at the right time, because it mops up the virus in the system, and it just gives the new patient’s immune system a vital push at the time it needs it.	0
NewsClaims	1452	But it has to be carefully timed and it’s not always successful.”	0
NewsClaims	1453	Ryan added: “So it is a very important area of discovery, and I believe they are starting trials on that in China.	0
NewsClaims	1454	But it is a very valid way to explore therapeutics, especially when we don’t have vaccines and we don’t have specific antivirals.”	0
NewsClaims	1455	As well as using plasma therapies, the Chinese doctors are also trying antiviral drugs licensed for use against other infections to see if they might help.	0
NewsClaims	1456	ROME (Reuters) - The new coronavirus was circulating in Italy in September 2019, a study by the National Cancer Institute (INT) of the Italian city of Milan shows, signaling that it might have spread beyond China earlier than thought.	0
NewsClaims	1457	But it has said “the possibility that the virus may have silently circulated elsewhere cannot be ruled out.”	0

NewsClaims	1459	The Italian researchers’ findings, published by the INT’s scientific magazine Tumori Journal, show 11.6% of 959 healthy volunteers enrolled in a lung cancer screening trial between September 2019 and March 2020 had developed coronavirus antibodies well before February.	0
NewsClaims	1460	A further SARS-CoV-2 antibodies test was carried out by the University of Siena for the same research titled “Unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the pre-pandemic period in Italy”.	0
NewsClaims	1461	It showed that four cases dating back to the first week of October were positive for antibodies, meaning they had got infected in September, Giovanni Apolone, a co-author of the study, told Reuters.	0
NewsClaims	1462	“This is the main finding: people with no symptoms not only were positive after the serological tests but also had antibodies able to kill the virus,” Apolone said.	0
NewsClaims	1463	“It means that the new coronavirus can circulate among the population for a long time and with a low rate of lethality, not because it is disappearing, only to surge again,” he said.	0
NewsClaims	1464	The WHO said it would contact the paper’s authors “to discuss and arrange for further analyses of available samples and verification of the neutralization results”.	0
NewsClaims	1465	Italian researchers told Reuters in March that they reported a higher than usual number of cases of severe pneumonia and flu in Lombardy in the last quarter of 2019 in a sign that the new coronavirus might have circulated earlier than thought.	0
NewsClaims	1466	There’s no evidence that the new coronavirus can survive on packages for 28 days	0
NewsClaims	1467	"A number of posts on Facebook, which have been shared thousands of times, have warned that ""if you order anything from CHINA be careful with your packages"" due to the coronavirus outbreak, because ""the virus can live on a surface for up to 28 days""."	0
NewsClaims	1468	This worry is likely overstated.	0
NewsClaims	1469	There is currently no evidence that this virus can survive that long on packages.	0
NewsClaims	1470	What does the medical advice say?	0
NewsClaims	1471	"As Dr Todd Ellerin, an expert in infectious diseases, wrote on the Harvard Medical School blog: ""Remember, this is a respiratory virus similar to the flu."	0
NewsClaims	1472	We don’t stop receiving packages from China during their flu season.	0
NewsClaims	1473	"We should follow that same logic for this novel pathogen."""	0
NewsClaims	1474	What do we know about how long this coronavirus survives on surfaces?	0
NewsClaims	1475	Because the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 (technically known as SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, there is little direct evidence on how it behaves.	0
NewsClaims	1476	However, because coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that have been studied for decades, it’s possible to look at the characteristics of similar viruses as a reasonable guide to this one.	0
NewsClaims	1477	But it’s worth noting that this was a study of	0
NewsClaims	1478	animal	0
NewsClaims	1479	coronaviruses, not human ones, and that the viruses lasted longest in very cold and dry conditions: at 4°C and 20% humidity.	0
NewsClaims	1480	This study was considered in the above paper that concluded human coronaviruses can survive for up to 9 days.	0
NewsClaims	1481	"In practice, as the WHO says, a package that ""has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature"" is unlikely to see the virus last as long."	0
NewsClaims	1482	"And as the CDC puts it, while it may be possible to pick up the virus from contaminated surfaces in general, ""this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads""."	0
NewsClaims	1483	Important Information about the novel coronavirus (the virus that causes COVID-19) is constantly evolving.	0
NewsClaims	1484	We will refresh our novel coronavirus content periodically based on newly published peer-reviewed findings to which we have access.	0
NewsClaims	1485	For the most reliable and up-to-date information, please visit the CDC website or the WHO’s advice for the public.	0
NewsClaims	1486	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the most recent strain of virus from the coronavirus family to infect humans.	0
NewsClaims	1487	This family of viruses also includes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).	0
NewsClaims	1488	They are called novel coronaviruses because it’s the first time these specific viruses have jumped from animals to humans.	0
NewsClaims	1489	Coronavirus myths, debunked	0
NewsClaims	1490	Rumors have spread rapidly about many aspects of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	1491	Here’s the truth about these coronavirus myths about where the virus originated, who is at risk, how it’s transmitted, and contamination concerns.	0
NewsClaims	1492	That was the start of COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	1493	MYTH: Coronavirus only affects older people	0
NewsClaims	1494	While older people may be more at risk of infection because their immune systems may not be as strong as those of younger adults, they’re far from the only group of people at risk, explains Dr. Patrick J. Kenney, DO, FACOI, who is double-board certified in Internal Medicine and Infectious Disease.	0
NewsClaims	1495	Several groups of people have an increased risk of infection, including those who are immunosuppressed.	0
NewsClaims	1496	Roll outs have begun nationwide but it may be some time before you can get the vaccine yourself.	0
NewsClaims	1497	Even worse, doing so may be harmful to your health.	0
NewsClaims	1498	Chlorine may be used to clean surfaces in your home but should be kept away from your body (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	1499	This is similar to the previous myth.	0
NewsClaims	1500	Bleach may also be used to clean surfaces in your home but should be kept away from the body (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	1501	Ingesting or inhaling chemicals can be deadly.	0
NewsClaims	1502	Exposing parts of your body to ultraviolet (UV) light can be dangerous.	0
NewsClaims	1503	The UV radiation may cause skin irritation, so you should not use UV sterilization lamps on your hands or other parts of your skin (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	1504	It currently isn’t known exactly how temperature affects the virus.	0
NewsClaims	1505	People have wondered the same thing about warm weather as they have about air dryers.	0
NewsClaims	1506	Although some similar viruses such as the common cold spread easier during colder months, the CDC notes that this doesn’t mean you cannot be infected by them during warmer months (2019-nCoV Frequently Asked Questions and Answers, 2020).	0
NewsClaims	1507	The World Health Organization (WHO) says air dryers are not effective at killing the virus, and they advise that you still wash your hands using proper hand hygiene before drying them with an air dryer or paper towels (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	1508	A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be detected in aerosols for up to three hours, on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 hours (Doremalen, 2020).	0
NewsClaims	1509	However, we don’t know how a warmer temperature would affect that timeline.	0
NewsClaims	1510	But there are common household cleaners that can inactivate the virus, and washing your hands following proper protocol can decrease your risk of infection.	0
NewsClaims	1511	Antibiotics target bacteria, not viruses.	0
NewsClaims	1512	COVID-19 is caused by a virus.	0
NewsClaims	1513	Surfaces in your home can also be cleaned with 70% ethanol (alcohol) cleanser, which can be purchased commercially, or bleach or sodium hypochlorite solutions, all of which inactivate the virus.	0
NewsClaims	1514	The fluids do not wash all of the virus particles into the stomach.	0
NewsClaims	1515	MYTH: You can diagnose yourself with COVID-19 by holding your breath	0
NewsClaims	1516	There is no evidence to suggest that being able to hold your breath is associated with whether or not you have COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	1517	If you think you might be sick, seek medical attention.	0

NewsClaims	1565	However, Facebook isn't the only platform used to spread these conspiracies.	0
NewsClaims	1566	On YouTube, the 10 most popular videos about Gates' purported microchipping vaccine have received over 5 million views, according to the same New York Times report.	0
NewsClaims	1567	"On Twitter, images and tweets describing Gates as a ""deep state puppet"" who wants a vaccine to control the population are also being posted and circulated."	0
NewsClaims	1568	These social-media platforms have tried to take steps to curtail the anti-vaccination or coronavirus misinformation movement on its website.	0
NewsClaims	1569	"On May 11, Twitter announced that it would start labeling ""misleading"" coronavirus information."	0
NewsClaims	1570	Last year, YouTube announced that it would demonetize videos on its platform that are pushing the anti-vaccine agenda.	0
NewsClaims	1571	"YouTube and Facebook also recently took down the 26-minute ""Plandemic"" movie from its platforms."	0
NewsClaims	1572	The debunked film featured the discredited scientist Judy Mikovits' claims that the US and vaccine companies created the coronavirus pandemic for profit.	0
NewsClaims	1573	However, the Gates conspiracy theorists don't just live online in the form of bots and fringe theorists on social media.	0
NewsClaims	1574	Public figures like Roger Stone and Laura Ingraham have also been pushing this message.	0
NewsClaims	1575	Gates has been a longtime supporter of vaccinations, and, so far, Gates has donated $300 million to coronavirus vaccine efforts, according to Vox.	0
NewsClaims	1576	Factors such as age and underlying health conditions such as diabetes can put you at a higher risk of contracting coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.	0
NewsClaims	1577	But one more factor that could affect your chances of getting coronavirus is your blood type, at least according to one recent study.	0
NewsClaims	1578	People who have blood Type A were “associated with” a 45% “higher risk of acquiring COVID-19” compared to people with other blood types, according to a study published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed New England Journal of Medicine by a team of European scientists.	0
NewsClaims	1579	Meanwhile, people with blood Type O, the most common blood type, less likely to get coronavirus as people with other blood types.	0
NewsClaims	1580	Don’t miss: Here are 9 hand sanitizers that the FDA warns can be toxic if absorbed by the body	0
NewsClaims	1581	The researchers arrived at this result after performing genetic analysis on more than 1,900 severely ill coronavirus patients in Spain and Italy and comparing them with over 2,000 patients who were not sick.	0
NewsClaims	1582	Also see: Here’s a look at who is most at risk of contracting COVID-19 and how much they earn for taking that risk	0
NewsClaims	1583	A commonality they found was a DNA cluster which determines blood types, among other components within the human body.	0
NewsClaims	1584	This prompted further research into which specific blood types were present in the majority of the severe cases of coronavirus they looked at.	0
NewsClaims	1585	Because the DNA cluster is found in other parts of the body, it may not be the case that blood type can predict one’s risk of contracting coronavirus, said Roy Silverstein, a hematologist who is the chairman of the department of medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin.	0
NewsClaims	1586	“ ‘Those who are not Type A should not interpret this study to mean that they can let their guard down.	0
NewsClaims	1587	Similarly, the data are not yet convincing enough to recommend that those with Type A need to do even more than what is recommended.’ ” — Roy Silverstein, Medical College of Wisconsin	0
NewsClaims	1588	“Those who are not type A should not interpret this study to mean that they can let their guard down,” Silverstein, former president the American Society of Hematology, said.	0
NewsClaims	1589	“Similarly, the data are not yet convincing enough to recommend that those with Type A need to do even more than what is recommended.”	0
NewsClaims	1590	A prior study published by the Southern University of Science and Technology in China, which has not been peer-reviewed, and a study by 23andMe, a privately held genetic-analysis company, pointed to similar results.	0
NewsClaims	1591	But even still, Silverstein urged people to take these findings “with a grain of salt.”	0
NewsClaims	1592	“This study, along with other studies from China and from 23andMe all suggest, but do not prove, a statistical association between non-O blood type with either risk of infection with the COVID-19 virus, or with risk of developing severe disease if infected.”	0
NewsClaims	1593	But the studies, he said, should prompt “more rigorous clinical studies as well as basic science studies to probe the mechanisms by which ABO blood type and or ABO genes might influence coronavirus ability to infect cells or the body’s immune response to the virus.”	0

NewsClaims	1625	Trail of Deceit: The Most Popular COVID-19 Myths and How They Emerged	0
NewsClaims	1626	by John Gregory and Kendrick McDonald	0
NewsClaims	1627	Editor’s Note: This report was updated in June 2020 to add additional COVID-19 myths that have become prominent online.	0
NewsClaims	1628	As COVID-19 has spread across the globe, NewsGuard’s team of journalists has been tracking, rating, and flagging websites spreading information about the disease in the Coronavirus Misinformation Tracking Center.	0
NewsClaims	1629	The tracker lists a growing number of websites that have published false claims about COVID-19, from false cures and phony treatments to conspiracy theories about the disease’s origins.	0
NewsClaims	1630	Many of the sites in the tracking center publish the same hoaxes and myths as misinformation spreads virally from one domain to another and through social media posts that amplify false articles.	0
NewsClaims	1631	Here, we document and debunk the top 10 COVID-19 myths that have spread across these sites—and trace how each myth emerged and began to spread across the internet.	0
NewsClaims	1632	Click each myth below to see its entry.	0
NewsClaims	1633	Or scroll down to browse through the full list.	0
NewsClaims	1634	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1635	The evidence provided for the claim was that two Chinese scientists were escorted from the lab in July 2019.	0
NewsClaims	1636	The CBC did, in fact, report that two Chinese scientists were escorted from the lab that month.	0
NewsClaims	1637	However, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) told the CBC that they were asked to leave due to an investigation of what it described as a “policy breach” and “administrative matter,” and that the matter was not connected to the COVID-19 virus outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	1638	“This is misinformation and there is no factual basis for claims being made on social media,” PHAC spokesperson Eric Morrissette told the CBC in January 2020.	0
NewsClaims	1639	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1640	As NewsGuard’s Washington correspondent Gabby Deutch documented in Wired, the earliest example of this claim was a January 26, 2020 article on GreatGameIndia.com titled “Coronavirus Bioweapon–How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It.” The article was then republished, word-for-word, on Red-rated misinformation site ZeroHedge.com, then one of the top 900 sites in the U.S., whose version was subsequently reposted on RedStateWatcher.com, an anonymously-run conservative site that is among the top 140 U.S. news sites as measured by engagement.	0
NewsClaims	1641	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1642	This claim was attributed to research posted on the website BioRxiv.org, where users can submit scientific studies before they have been peer-reviewed and published.	0
NewsClaims	1643	According to a February 2020 article on the fact-checking website HealthFeedback.org, the study’s finding that there is a similarity between the new strain of coronavirus and HIV “was detected using extremely short protein sequences, a practice that often gives rise to false positive results,” and the authors failed to note that the same sequences are found in many other organisms.	0
NewsClaims	1644	The authors of the study withdrew it from BioRxiv.org two days after it first appeared on the website.	0
NewsClaims	1645	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1646	The preprint study on BioRxiv.org was first promoted by Harvard University epidemiologist and health economist Eric Feigl-Ding in a series of tweets on Jan. 31, 2020, though he did note the study had not been peer-reviewed.	0
NewsClaims	1647	Ding’s tweets and the preprint study were then cited in a ZeroHedge.com article posted that same day, which was in turn republished in full on InfoWars.com, a Red-rated far-right website that falsely asserted that the mass shooting Sandy Hook Elementary was a hoax, among other false claims.	0
NewsClaims	1648	MYTH: “The COVID-19 pandemic was predicted in a simulation.”	0
NewsClaims	1649	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1650	The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Gates Foundation did host a pandemic preparedness exercise called Event 201 in October 2019.	0
NewsClaims	1651	However the scenario used in the exercise involved a fictional coronavirus with different characteristics than the COVID-19 virus.	0
NewsClaims	1652	For example, in this simulation, the virus originated on pig farms in Brazil, not in China.	0
NewsClaims	1653	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1654	This earliest example of this claim was Jan. 22, 2020 post on Reddit’s conspiracy subreddit channel, referencing October 2019 news articles about the simulation along with more recent articles about the outbreak in China.	0
NewsClaims	1655	It was then more widely circulated in a Jan. 23 article from InfoWars.	0
NewsClaims	1656	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1657	“Pirbright does not currently work with human coronaviruses,” the institute said in a January 2020 post on its website responding to the patent conspiracy theory.	0
NewsClaims	1658	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1659	Fact-checking websites FactCheck.org and Snopes pointed to a Jan. 21, 2020 tweet from Jordan Sather, a U.S. conspiracy theorist with 140,000 Twitter followers and 218,000 subscribers to his “Destroying the Illusion” YouTube channel, as the earliest example of this claim.	0
NewsClaims	1660	InfoWars then repeated it in the Jan. 23 article about the simulation co-hosted by the Gates Foundation described above.	0
NewsClaims	1661	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1662	A study published in the journal Nature in February 2020 found the new virus’s genome is “96 percent identical” to a bat coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	1663	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1664	Similar conspiracy theories have been promoted by misinformation websites during earlier disease outbreaks.	0
NewsClaims	1665	For example, NaturalNews.com, a Red-rated network of site promoting both medical and political conspiracies, previously labeled the Ebola virus as a “bioweapon” during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa.	0
NewsClaims	1666	The earliest mention NewsGuard could find of the COVID-19 virus being called a “bioweapon” was a Jan. 23, 2020 video from U.S. conspiracy theorist David Zublick, titled “Breaking: Coronavirus Is Bioweapon For Population Control.” Zublick has 160,000 subscribers on YouTube.	0
NewsClaims	1667	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1668	In an April 2020 article from the BBC, Dr. Simon Clarke, a microbiology professor at the University of Reading, described claims that 5G either transmits the virus, or suppresses the immune system, thus making people more vulnerable to it, as “complete rubbish.” A March 2020 report from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection found no evidence that 5G networks posed a risk to human health.	0
NewsClaims	1669	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1670	The earliest mention NewsGuard could find tying 5G to the new coronavirus was a Jan. 20, 2020 article on the Red-rated, anonymously-run French conspiracy theory blog Les Moutons Enragés, according to data First Draft News shared with NewsGuard.	0

NewsClaims	1675	Colloidal silver is a liquid substance containing silver particles.	0
NewsClaims	1676	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1677	Despite the lack of evidence supporting its use, colloidal silver has been promoted as a cure for all kinds of ailments, from bacterial and viral infections to cancer, since the late 19th century.	0
NewsClaims	1678	Existing sellers of colloidal silver began promoting it as a treatment for COVID-19, most prominently on a Feb. 12, 2020 broadcast of televangelist Jim Bakker’s TV show.	0

NewsClaims	1681	Miracle Mineral Solution, or MMS, is chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleaching agent that has been promoted as a cure-all for everything from cancer to autism.	0
NewsClaims	1682	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1683	The earliest mention of the theory that MMS could treat the new coronavirus strain was a January 25, 2020 tweet from Jordan Sather, the U.S. conspiracy theorist described above as originating the Bill Gates patent conspiracy.	0
NewsClaims	1684	It was later promoted in a January 27, 2020 article posted on the website of Jim Humble, a former Scientologist and gold prospector who claimed to have discovered MMS in 1996.	0

NewsClaims	1688	The earliest example of this claim was a Jan. 31, 2020 post from an anonymous Twitter account based in the Philippines, sharing a recipe claiming the virus “can be cured by one bowl of freshly boiled garlic water,” according to a February 2020 article from FactCheck.org.	0
NewsClaims	1689	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1690	While a clinical trial is underway in China to test whether a high-dose vitamin C regimen is effective against the new strain of coronavirus, the claim that it is a proven treatment for COVID-19 is not supported by scientific evidence.	0
NewsClaims	1691	Vitamin C has some marginal benefits for the common cold, such as reducing the duration of symptoms if it is taken before catching the cold, but those benefits can be achieved with a diet that includes 200 milligrams of vitamin C, according to Harvard Health Publishing.	0
NewsClaims	1692	The daily dosage being tested in the Chinese trial is 60 times higher.	0
NewsClaims	1693	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1694	The claim originated in a Jan. 26, 2020 press release titled “Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus,” from the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine, which promotes large doses of nutritional supplements.	0
NewsClaims	1695	The article was then republished in full the next day on HealthImpactNews.com, a Red-rated network of health sites with 450,000 Facebook followers that has promoted false health claims such as the debunked link between vaccines and autism.	0
NewsClaims	1696	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1697	This myth relies on the false claim that what you eat or drink creates an alkaline environment in your body, making it less acidic by raising its pH level.	0

NewsClaims	1699	Similar alkaline diet remedies have been falsely promoted as cancer cures, prompting Cancer Research UK to call them “biological nonsense” in a March 2014 article.	0
NewsClaims	1700	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1701	This claim, according to a March 2020 article from PolitiFact.com, has its origins in a video shared on Facebook Messenger by Marian Gorban the owner of MrHealthyChannel, an alternative health channel on YouTube with more than 22,000 subscribers.	0
NewsClaims	1702	This claim was first published by the Italian website ViralMagazine.it and received more than 70,000 interactions on Facebook, including more than 40,000 shares, according to data from social media metrics company CrowdTangle.	0
NewsClaims	1703	The false claim was also published on the site FanMagazine.it, which is connected to the Facebook Pages ღஐღ Semplicemente Charlie ღஐღ and Ti amo, però ღஐღ Semplicemente Charlie ღஐღ, which have more than 2 million followers and more than 600,000 followers, respectively.	0
NewsClaims	1704	MYTH: “The Italian Government is preventing migrants from being tested for COVID-19.”	0
NewsClaims	1705	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1706	The Italian Government has never forbidden the testing of migrants for the COVID-19 virus.	0
NewsClaims	1707	As stated by the director of the provincial health authority of Ragusa Angelo Aliquò in February 2020, “Ministerial guidelines say that only those who come from areas at risk and have symptoms need to be tested.” According to NewSicilia.it, three migrants with symptoms who arrived in Italy on the Ocean Viking ship were tested for COVID-19 in February 2020, and the tests came back negative.	0
NewsClaims	1708	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1709	This claim appears to have first been published by the Red-rated Italian website VoxNews.info on Feb. 27, 2020, misquoting an interview of Aliquò by Il Primato Nazionale, a site connected to the neo-fascist movement CasaPound.	0
NewsClaims	1710	The next day, the Red-rated ViralMagazine.it published an almost identical article — adding more fabricated quotes attributed to Aliquò — which received more than 80,000 Facebook interactions, more than a third of which were shares, according to CrowdTangle data.	0
NewsClaims	1711	MYTH: “Bill Gates plans to use COVID-19 to implement a mandatory vaccine program with microchips to surveil people.”	0
NewsClaims	1712	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1713	Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his charitable foundation have long supported vaccine initiatives.	0
NewsClaims	1714	However, there is no vaccine — for COVID-19 or otherwise — with a microchip or other surveillance feature.	0
NewsClaims	1715	In December 2019, researchers at MIT, who had received funding from the Gates Foundation, published a paper about technology they developed that can keep a vaccination record on a patient’s skin with an ink-like injection that could be read by smartphone.	0
NewsClaims	1716	The technology does not have the capacity to track patients’ movements, Kevin McHugh, a Rice University bioengineering professor who worked on the study while at MIT, told FactCheck.org.	0
NewsClaims	1717	The Gates Foundation told FactCheck.org that the research is unrelated to COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	1718	Some versions of this conspiracy theory also assert that the purpose of the “tracking” vaccine is to control or reduce the world population, which is also false.	0
NewsClaims	1719	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1720	According to FactCheck.org and BuzzFeed News, conspiracy theorists have distorted comments that Gates made during a March 18 Reddit forum.	0
NewsClaims	1721	Gates discussed “digital certificates,” a technology used to transmit encrypted information online, as part of a solution to expand COVID-19 testing.	0
NewsClaims	1722	However, conspiracy theorists claim that Gates was referring instead to the MIT research into skin-based vaccination records — which is not related to the “digital certificates” Gates was describing.	0
NewsClaims	1723	The website BioHackInfo.com published a story containing the false claims on March 19, 2020, the day after Gates’ Reddit forum, using the term “microchip,” which did not appear in either Gates’ statements or the research.	0
NewsClaims	1724	FactCheck.org and BuzzFeed News reported that the conspiracy theory was subsequently amplified by a YouTube video from the Jacksonville, Florida-based Law of Liberty Baptist Church, which received 1.9 million views as of publication.	0
NewsClaims	1725	MYTH: “Getting a flu shot increases your risk of getting COVID-19.”	0
NewsClaims	1726	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1727	There is no evidence that the flu vaccine either increases or decreases the risk of being infected with the COVID-19 virus.	0
NewsClaims	1728	Studies cited to back this false claim, such as one published in the journal Vaccine in January 2020, did not mention the COVID-19 virus, having used data collected years before the virus emerged.	0
NewsClaims	1729	While some studies — including the research published in Vaccine — have found an association between the flu shot and non-influenza respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold, over the course of a single flu season, that association was not found in a larger study that included data from multiple seasons.	0
NewsClaims	1730	According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “the preponderance of evidence suggests that this is not a common or regular occurrence and that influenza vaccination does not, in fact, make people more susceptible to other respiratory infections.”	0
NewsClaims	1731	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1732	DisabledVeterans.org, a news site that calls itself a “watchdog” of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, first promoted the claim in a March 11, 2020 article that cited the January 2020 Vaccine study.	0
NewsClaims	1733	The same study was cited in an April 16, 2020 article by Collective Evolution, a NewsGuard Red-rated conspiracy theory website that has more than 5 million followers on Facebook.	0
NewsClaims	1734	MYTH: “Wearing a face mask can cause hypercapnia, a condition of too much carbon dioxide”	0
NewsClaims	1735	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1736	Hypercapnia is caused by having much carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, such as can be caused by underwater diving.	0
NewsClaims	1737	Health care workers who regularly wear face masks for long periods of time do not develop this condition.	0
NewsClaims	1738	According to health fact-checking website HealthFeedback.org, even surgical and N95 masks are porous enough to allow gas molecules such as carbon dioxide to pass through, while limiting exposure to the respiratory droplets that could spread the COVID-19 virus.	0
NewsClaims	1739	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1740	The earliest example of this claim was an April 6, 2020 post from a Facebook user in Bangkok, Thailand, cited in a May 2020 article from Agence France-Presse.	0
NewsClaims	1741	English language posts promoting the same claim began circulating in Thailand and South Africa that same month, AFP reported.	0
NewsClaims	1742	MYTH: “Wearing a face mask will push the COVID-19 virus into your brain”	0
NewsClaims	1743	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1744	There is no evidence that wearing a mask will cause the COVID-19 virus to enter the brain.	0
NewsClaims	1745	“Breathing out the virus is not going to appreciably change the amount that is there,” Sarah Stanley, an infectious diseases professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told The Associated Press in a May 2020 fact-checking article.	0
NewsClaims	1746	“Therefore, there should be no reason why wearing a mask would increase your chance of infection in the brain.”	0
NewsClaims	1747	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1748	A May 11, 2020 article on NewsGuard Red-rated anti-technology website Technocracy.news from Dr. Russell Blaylock, a retired neurosurgeon, was the earliest example of this claim identified by NewsGuard.	0
NewsClaims	1749	Blaylock has previously promoted the debunked link between vaccines and autism in a health newsletter he edits for conservative news site Newsmax.com.	0
NewsClaims	1750	PJ Media, a Red-rated site that is among the top 70 news sites in the U.S. as measured by engagement, repeated Blaylock’s false face mask claims in a May 14 article.	0
NewsClaims	1751	While PJ Media later corrected other information in the article, its correction notice did not address the false claim about face masks pushing the COVID-19 virus into the brain.	0

NewsClaims	1758	On April 1, French far-right website Ns2017.Wordpress.com promoted the claim, and another French Red-rated site called Lanceurdalerte.info shared it again three days later.	0
NewsClaims	1759	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1760	The institute explains on its website that in 2004, it patented a strategy to create a vaccine for another strain of the SARS coronavirus, which is not the virus responsible for the Covid-19 disease.	0
NewsClaims	1761	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1762	As French media Le Monde and Sciences et Avenir have reported, this hoax started with a since-deleted video published on Facebook on March 17.	0
NewsClaims	1763	On March 18, NewsGuard French Red-rated website Ns2017.wordpress.com promoted the claim on its website.	0
NewsClaims	1764	MYTH: “The French government authorized euthanasia in the middle of the crisis”	0
NewsClaims	1765	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1766	In March 2020, the French government issued a decree that allowed doctors to temporarily use anti-epileptic drug Rivotril to alleviate pain for end-of-life patients in severe respiratory distress.	0
NewsClaims	1767	However, the decree did not authorize euthanasia or physician-assisted death.	0
NewsClaims	1768	There is no evidence that any patient in France was euthanized under these circumstances, and euthanasia is illegal in the country.	0
NewsClaims	1769	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1770	First circulated on social media, this false claim was shared on April 7 on NewsGuard Red-rated anti-Islam website RiposteLaique.com.	0
NewsClaims	1771	A day later, it was promoted by French far-right website NS2017.wordpress.com.	0
NewsClaims	1772	On April 16, Red-rated French website BVoltaire.fr published an interview with a French medical doctor named Joëlle de Monredon claiming that the government’s move was “euthanasia and eugenics.” This interview was republished on April 18 by Contre-Info.com, a NewsGuard Red-rated website owned by a nonprofit connected with the Catholic nationalist organization Renouveau Français.	0
NewsClaims	1773	MYTH: In Europe, “Contact tracing apps were automatically installed on people’s smartphones without their consent”	0
NewsClaims	1774	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1775	As countries started lifting lockdowns, Google and Apple developed a tool for governments to build their own contact-tracing apps to curb the spread of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	1776	In their latest updates, smartphones from the two brands included this exposure notification system.	0
NewsClaims	1777	Some countries, like Italy, used this feature to build their national app, but others, like France, chose not to.	0
NewsClaims	1778	In countries where governments decided to use it, citizens still had to download the app first, and to activate the feature before it did anything.	0
NewsClaims	1779	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1780	In Italy, NewsGuard Red-rated site ByoBlu.com claimed on May 26 that the Google feature had been automatically installed and activated on people’s phones.	0
NewsClaims	1781	In France, the Red-rated website LumiereSurGaia.com, a hub of coronavirus hoaxes and false information about topics such as UFOs and the environment, published on May 29 an article claiming that the French government had secretly installed its app on people’s phones, and encouraged users to uninstall it.	0
NewsClaims	1782	(At that time, the French government app had not even been released).	0
NewsClaims	1783	The false claim was then reposted on May 31 by Red-rated site ReseauInternational.net and, on June 1, by WikiStrike.com.	0
NewsClaims	1784	These three websites are among the most popular misinformation sites in France.	0
NewsClaims	1785	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1786	This variation on the false claim that the COVID-19 virus is manmade relies on misrepresenting a study published in the journal Nature Medicine in 2015.	0
NewsClaims	1787	The research found that bat coronaviruses were capable of directly infecting humans, but it did not involve the same strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	1788	The study authors included researchers from UNC as well as the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.	0
NewsClaims	1789	A March 2020 editor’s note on the original study addressed the conspiracy theory.	0
NewsClaims	1790	“We are aware that this article is being used as the basis for unverified theories that the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 was engineered,” the note said.	0
NewsClaims	1791	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1792	The earliest mention of this false claim found by NewsGuard was a story from ShadOlsonShow.com in late February.	0
NewsClaims	1793	Radio host Olson reported on his site that he was “First to reveal the links to the ‘gain of function’ coronavirus study by Dr. Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina.” The claim received further attention when it was spread in a series of March 3, 2020 tweets from an account using the name Greg Rubini, which has 129,000 followers.	0
NewsClaims	1794	According to a June 2020 article from BuzzFeed News, the Twitter account is run by an Italian man named Gregorio Palusa, a sound engineer and marketer.	0
NewsClaims	1795	Palusa has no proven expertise in national security or intelligence, but conservative cable news network One America News brought this myth further into the mainstream by citing his tweets under the Greg Rubini pseudonym in a March 14 report, describing him as “a citizen investigator and monitored source amongst a certain set in the D.C. intelligence community,” according to liberal nonprofit Media Matters.	0

NewsClaims	1798	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	1799	There is no evidence that Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has personal financial investments in vaccines being developed for COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	1800	Fauci’s agency is working with pharmaceutical company Moderna on a potential vaccine — one of 141 that are currently in development, according to the World Health Organization — but PolitiFact found no record of a business relationship between Fauci and Moderna in an April 2020 search of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s database.	0
NewsClaims	1801	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	1802	PolitiFact reported that the false accusation against Fauci was made in an April 12, 2020 post on an anti-vaccine Facebook page called I Am Awake, which has 13,000 likes on the platform.	0
NewsClaims	1803	A similar claim was made by anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., on an April 20 podcast hosted on TruePundit.com, a NewsGuard Red-rated website that ranks among the top 850 U.S. news sites as measured by engagement.	0

NewsClaims	1811	This study comes on the heels of another recent report from Shenzen, China which found SARS- CoV-2 genetic material, not live virus capable of replication, on the surface of frozen chicken wings, a story recently covered by fellow Forbes contributor, Bruce Lee.	0
NewsClaims	1812	Needless to say, as Lee emphasizes, finding genetic material on the surface of food is not the same as finding live replicating virus.	0
NewsClaims	1813	This distinction is important because viruses are quite different than bacteria—they cannot survive on their own without a live host.	0
NewsClaims	1814	Besides, having even enough virus is even more crucial to risk of infection.	0
NewsClaims	1815	In fact, another recent report by Reuters also found the presence of viral genetic material on the outer packaging of frozen seafood in Yantai, China.	0
NewsClaims	1816	Even the possibility of aerosolization of fomites (virus on surfaces) while offered, is still quite remote and does not constitute the primary mode of transmission.	0
NewsClaims	1817	For the new study, the researchers inoculated 500 tiny individual cubes of salmon, chicken and pork from supermarkets in Singapore with a hefty dose of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.	0

NewsClaims	1840	However it does not establish that this is may be a mode of possible transmission of Covid-19.	0

NewsClaims	1854	Remdesivir is a direct-acting antiviral drug that inhibits a virus’ ability to replicate.	0
NewsClaims	1855	The drug binds to the virus’ RNA, where the viral genetic information is housed, and blocks an enzyme called polymerase from reproducing thousands of copies of RNA strands in the host patient.	0

NewsClaims	1881	Those on lopinavir-ritonavir received 400 mg of lopinavir and 100 mg of ritonavir by mouth every 12 hours for 10 days or until discharge, if sooner.	0
NewsClaims	1882	The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality.	0
NewsClaims	1883	Findings from the trial indicate that using lopinavir-ritonavir to treat patients hospitalised with COVID-19 does not reduce deaths within 28 days of treatment beginning.	0
NewsClaims	1884	23% (374/1,616 patients) who received lopinavir-ritonavir and 22% (767/3,424 patients) allocated to usual care died within 28 days.	0
NewsClaims	1885	"Professor Peter Horby, from the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the University of Oxford, UK, co-Chief Investigator of the RECOVERY trial, said: ""The result from the RECOVERY trial is clear."	0
NewsClaims	1886	"When combined with findings from an earlier, smaller trial and with the WHO interim results, this provides strong evidence that lopinavir-ritonavir is not an effective treatment for patients hospitalised with COVID-19."""	0
NewsClaims	1887	[1]	0
NewsClaims	1888	"""Whilst it is disappointing that there was no significant benefit from lopinavir-ritonavir for patients in hospital, these findings have allowed us to focus our efforts on other promising treatments, and have informed the way in which individual patients are treated."""	0
NewsClaims	1889	[1]	0
NewsClaims	1890	The authors also found that lopinavir-ritonavir did not reduce the length of patients' hospital stay, with 69% (1,113/1,616 patients) in the lopinavir-ritonavir group leaving hospital within 28 days, compared with 70% (2,382/3,424 patients) of those receiving usual care.	0
NewsClaims	1891	Both groups had a median stay of 11 days.	0
NewsClaims	1892	No significant difference was observed in the risk of needing to be placed on a ventilator, with 10% (152/1,556 patients) of those in the lopinavir-ritonavir group needing ventilation, compared with 9% (279/3,280 patients) in those receiving usual care.	0
NewsClaims	1893	Results were consistent across all patient subgroups - including age, sex and ethnicity - with no evidence of any benefit from lopinavir-ritonavir treatment.	0
NewsClaims	1894	The authors note that few patients who had undergone intubation - insertion of a tube into the airway to aid breathing using a ventilator - took part in the trial due to difficulties in giving the treatment to patients who could not swallow, and so it is not possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of lopinavir-ritonavir for mechanically ventilated patients.	0
NewsClaims	1895	Results from the large-scale RECOVERY clinical trial - combined with findings from an earlier, smaller trial and with the WHO interim results - provide strong evidence that lopinavir-ritonavir is not an effective treatment for patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and clinical care guidelines should be updated accordingly.	0
NewsClaims	1896	"Writing in a linked Comment, lead authors Bin Cao and Frederick G Hayden (who were not involved the study), from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University, China, and the University of Virginia School of Medicine, USA, say: ""Compared with the first randomised trial to investigate lopinavir-ritonavir in patients with COVID-19 by Cao and colleagues (including the authors of this Comment), the size of the lopinavir-ritonavir group in the RECOVERY trial was much larger and hence provides a more solid evidence base regarding possible lopinavir-ritonavir treatment effects."	0
NewsClaims	1897	"[...] The findings of these two open-label studies support each other and conclude that lopinavir-ritonavir is not effective in improving outcomes for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19."""	0

NewsClaims	1959	The Chicha and Pisco Criminal Appeals Chamber decided that the ever-dreaded Chinese germs were the product of “criminal elite around the world” – mostly multi-billionaires with global depopulation on their minds.	0
NewsClaims	1960	These defendants had tried to appeal, but Judges Tito Gallego, Luis Legia, and Tony Changarei issued a delay, justifying it due to the “unpredictable” nature of the “pandemic.”	0
NewsClaims	1961	It was only predictable for ordinary people, however, as the alleged creators of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) “who have been involved in it and continue to manage it with particular secrecy in their environment” are entirely unaffected.	0
NewsClaims	1962	In fact, Bill Gates has never once been seen wearing a face mask, nor is he willing to take the vaccines he is now pushing everyone else to get for their “safety” and “protection” against the WuFlu.	0
NewsClaims	1963	“No world government, individuals or legal entities, nor the defense of the accused can claim that this pandemic has the quality of ‘foresight,’ except for the creators of the new world order, such as Bill Gates, Soros, Rockefeller, etc.,” the magistrates wrote in their resolution, which was posted to the LP Law portal.	0

NewsClaims	1967	Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Gates et al.	0
NewsClaims	1968	The document specifically names billionaire financier and globalist agitator George Soros, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and the entire Rockefeller family as criminals who are guilty of “managing” and “continuing to direct” the virus straight into the “new world order.”	0
NewsClaims	1969	If only our own criminal justice system would take the same approach, then perhaps we could finally put an end to all the lockdowns, mask-wearing and superstitious paranoia that has brainwashed millions of our own people.	0
NewsClaims	1970	Even better, we could finally try Gates et al.	0
NewsClaims	1971	for their many crimes against humanity and punish them accordingly.	0
NewsClaims	1972	Meanwhile, in lieu of justice, Gates is already planning for the next plandemic, warning those who actually listen to what he has to say that this is war.	0
NewsClaims	1973	“We can’t afford to be caught flat-footed again,” the whiny geek is quoted as saying.	0
NewsClaims	1974	“To prevent the hardship of this last year from happening again, pandemic preparedness must be taken as seriously as we take the threat of war.”	0

NewsClaims	1983	Exposure occurs in three principal ways: (1) inhalation of very fine respiratory droplets and aerosol particles, (2) deposition of respiratory droplets and particles on exposed mucous membranes in the mouth, nose, or eye by direct splashes and sprays, and (3) touching mucous membranes with hands that have been soiled either directly by virus-containing respiratory fluids or indirectly by touching surfaces with virus on them.	0
NewsClaims	1984	The largest droplets settle out of the air rapidly, within seconds to minutes.	0
NewsClaims	1985	The smallest very fine droplets, and aerosol particles formed when these fine droplets rapidly dry, are small enough that they can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.	0
NewsClaims	1986	Infectious exposures to respiratory fluids carrying SARS-CoV-2 occur in three principal ways (not mutually exclusive):	0
NewsClaims	1987	Inhalation of air carrying very small fine droplets and aerosol particles that contain infectious virus.	0
NewsClaims	1988	Risk of transmission is greatest within three to six feet of an infectious source where the concentration of these very fine droplets and particles is greatest.	0
NewsClaims	1989	Deposition of virus carried in exhaled droplets and particles onto exposed mucous membranes (i.e., “splashes and sprays”, such as being coughed on).	0
NewsClaims	1990	Touching mucous membranes with hands soiled by exhaled respiratory fluids containing virus or from touching inanimate surfaces contaminated with virus.	0
NewsClaims	1991	The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies according to the amount of virus to which a person is exposed	0
NewsClaims	1992	Once infectious droplets and particles are exhaled, they move outward from the source.	0
NewsClaims	1993	The risk for infection decreases with increasing distance from the source and increasing time after exhalation.	0
NewsClaims	1994	Two principal processes determine the amount of virus to which a person is exposed in the air or by touching a surface contaminated by virus:	0
NewsClaims	1995	Decreasing concentration of virus in the air as larger and heavier respiratory droplets containing virus fall to the ground or other surfaces under the force of gravity and the very fine droplets and aerosol particles that remain in the airstream progressively mix with, and become diluted within, the growing volume and streams of air they encounter.	0
NewsClaims	1996	This mixing is not necessarily uniform and can be influenced by thermal layering and initial jetting of exhalations.	0
NewsClaims	1997	Progressive loss of viral viability and infectiousness over time influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet radiation (e.g., sunlight).	0
NewsClaims	1998	With increasing distance from the source, the role of inhalation likewise increases.	0
NewsClaims	1999	Per published reports, factors that increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection under these circumstances include:	0
NewsClaims	2000	Enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation or air handling within which the concentration of exhaled respiratory fluids, especially very fine droplets and aerosol particles, can build-up in the air space.	0
NewsClaims	2001	within which the concentration of exhaled respiratory fluids, especially very fine droplets and aerosol particles, can build-up in the air space.	0
NewsClaims	2002	Increased exhalation of respiratory fluids if the infectious person is engaged in physical exertion or raises their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing).	0
NewsClaims	2003	of respiratory fluids if the infectious person is engaged in physical exertion or raises their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing).	0
NewsClaims	2004	Prolonged exposure to these conditions, typically more than 15 minutes.	0
NewsClaims	2005	Prevention of COVID-19 transmission	0
NewsClaims	2006	The infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 needed to transmit infection has not been established.	0
NewsClaims	2007	Although animal studies22-24 and epidemiologic investigations25 (in addition to those described above) indicate that inhalation of virus can cause infection, the relative contributions of inhalation of virus and deposition of virus on mucous membranes remain unquantified and will be difficult to establish.	0
NewsClaims	2008	Despite these knowledge gaps, the available evidence continues to demonstrate that existing recommendations to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission remain effective.	0
NewsClaims	2009	These include physical distancing, community use of well-fitting masks (e.g., barrier face coverings, procedure/surgical masks), adequate ventilation, and avoidance of crowded indoor spaces.	0
NewsClaims	2010	These methods will reduce transmission both from inhalation of virus and deposition of virus on exposed mucous membranes.	0

NewsClaims	2014	Issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and adopted by many businesses, it’s the guideline that most of us have lived by during COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2015	Because when you’re inside, microscopic droplets are trapped right alongside you in a confined space, and standing six feet away from someone doesn’t stop the SARS-CoV-2 virus from floating in the air of your living room where you can potentially inhale it.	0

NewsClaims	2019	Bush, alongside his MIT colleague Martin Z.	0
NewsClaims	2020	Bazant, have answered that question with a complex mathematical model, which simulates the fluid dynamics of virus-loaded respiratory droplets in any space, from a cozy kitchen to a gigantic concert hall.	0
NewsClaims	2021	And because the equation is far too complicated for most people to understand, they turned their findings into a free online tool.	0
NewsClaims	2022	Go to this website, and you can create your own custom scenario to judge COVID-19 risks for yourself.	0
NewsClaims	2023	[Image: COVID-19 Indoor Safety Guideline]	0
NewsClaims	2024	The tool assumes one person in a room with you has COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2025	Then, it hands you an incredible amount of control to tweak the variables at play.	0
NewsClaims	2026	These variables include details about the building: What’s the square footage?	0
NewsClaims	2027	What’s the height of the ceiling?	0
NewsClaims	2028	How about the HVAC system—is it a standard domestic furnace or does it have a fancy HEPA filter?	0
NewsClaims	2029	What’s the humidity?	0
NewsClaims	2030	Is a window open?	0
NewsClaims	2031	The variables also include all sorts of details about human behavior: How many other people are there with you?	0
NewsClaims	2032	Are they wearing masks?	0
NewsClaims	2033	Cotton or surgical?	0
NewsClaims	2034	Do they wear masks properly or pull them down their face a bit?	0
NewsClaims	2035	Are they whispering or singing?	0
NewsClaims	2036	At first glance, all of these controls might seem overwhelming.	0
NewsClaims	2037	(And they are!)	0
NewsClaims	2038	But the payoff is worth it.	0
NewsClaims	2039	Because the tool gives you a very clear answer of how long how many people can safely be in a space together.	0
NewsClaims	2040	Let’s try an example.	0
NewsClaims	2041	You just enjoyed Thanksgiving dinner in a typical 20-foot-by-20-foot dining room with a group of 10 people.	0
NewsClaims	2042	People talked normally.	0
NewsClaims	2043	Nobody was wearing masks since they were eating.	0
NewsClaims	2044	The air was of average humidity.	0
NewsClaims	2045	"""Based on this model, it should be safe for this room to have: 10 people for 18 minutes."""	0
NewsClaims	2046	If you had simply followed a six-foot distance guideline and worn a mask, as the CDC suggests, these guests would be safe hanging out indefinitely.	0
NewsClaims	2047	Which is clearly nonsensical.	0
NewsClaims	2048	"""But what if they were wearing masks?"""	0
NewsClaims	2049	you ask.	0
NewsClaims	2050	Good question.	0
NewsClaims	2051	Let’s assume no one ate and instead talked through coarse cotton masks.	0
NewsClaims	2052	It buys another six minutes.	0
NewsClaims	2053	But with a catch: If those surgical masks are worn improperly by half of the people—say, the masks fit loosely or the wearers’ noses are sticking out—the safe time plummets back down to 32 minutes.	0
NewsClaims	2054	Human factors matter a lot.	0
NewsClaims	2055	"After working on the source math behind this tool, Bush concludes that we absolutely should because it’s the most ""dramatic"" effect he noticed; it moves the needle in any circumstance, buying you precious minutes to stay safe."	0
NewsClaims	2056	However, masks are not hazmat suits.	0
NewsClaims	2057	They cannot overcome the reality of being in a small space with other people.	0
NewsClaims	2058	To prove the point, let’s make that dining room bigger.	0
NewsClaims	2059	In fact, let’s stretch it into a 180,000-square-foot Walmart.	0
NewsClaims	2060	And let’s fill it with 1,000 people who are good about wearing their coarse cotton masks.	0
NewsClaims	2061	The only other variable I’m changing is that the air is probably a bit drier than in your home.	0
NewsClaims	2062	In these conditions, the tool says people should be safe for 68 minutes—if only	0
NewsClaims	2063	one	0
NewsClaims	2064	person has COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2065	Just keep this in mind: Where I live, around Chicago, as many as 1 in 15 people currently have COVID-19, so as many as 66 people in that Walmart could have COVID-19 out of 1,000.	0
NewsClaims	2066	Here, we run into a shortcoming of the tool.	0
NewsClaims	2067	It models a single sick person in a space, not what happens when real infection rates hit what they are now.	0
NewsClaims	2068	And there’s no way to tweak it accordingly.	0
NewsClaims	2069	Obviously this is just a model.	0
NewsClaims	2070	It’s a simulation—researchers’ best guess of how our world works.	0
NewsClaims	2071	It isn’t perfect and cannot guarantee your safety in any situation.	0
NewsClaims	2072	But after using this MIT tool for more than an hour, I went from feeling comforted to feeling like things are even less safe than I thought.	0

NewsClaims	2272	Further analysis indicates that some of the 2019-nCoV genes shared less than 80% nucleotide sequence identity to SARS-CoV.	0
NewsClaims	2273	However, the amino acid sequences of the seven conserved replicase domains in ORF1ab that were used for CoV species classification were 94.4% identical between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, suggesting that the two viruses belong to the same species, SARSr-CoV.	0
NewsClaims	2274	We then found that a short region of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13)—which was previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province—showed high sequence identity to 2019-nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	2275	We carried out full-length sequencing on this RNA sample (GISAID accession number EPI_ISL_402131).	0
NewsClaims	2276	Simplot analysis showed that 2019-nCoV was highly similar throughout the genome to RaTG13 (Fig.	0

NewsClaims	2278	Using the aligned genome sequences of 2019-nCoV, RaTG13, SARS-CoV and previously reported bat SARSr-CoVs, no evidence for recombination events was detected in the genome of 2019-nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	2279	Phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome and the gene sequences of RdRp and spike (S) showed that—for all sequences—RaTG13 is the closest relative of 2019-nCoV and they form a distinct lineage from other SARSr-CoVs (Fig.	0

NewsClaims	2284	The S genes of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 are longer than other SARSr-CoVs.	0
NewsClaims	2285	The major differences in the sequence of the S gene of 2019-nCoV are the three short insertions in the N-terminal domain as well as changes in four out of five of the key residues in the receptor-binding motif compared with the sequence of SARS-CoV (Extended Data Fig.	0
NewsClaims	2286	3).	0
NewsClaims	2287	Whether the insertions in the N-terminal domain of the S protein of 2019-nCoV confer sialic-acid-binding activity as it does in MERS-CoV needs to be further studied.	0
NewsClaims	2288	The close phylogenetic relationship to RaTG13 provides evidence that 2019-nCoV may have originated in bats.	0
NewsClaims	2289	We rapidly developed a qPCR-based detection method on the basis of the sequence of the receptor-binding domain of the S gene, which was the most variable region of the genome (Fig.	0

NewsClaims	2292	4a, b).	0
NewsClaims	2293	Of the samples obtained from the seven patients, we found that six BALF and five oral swab samples were positive for 2019-nCoV during the first sampling, as assessed by qPCR and conventional PCR.	0
NewsClaims	2294	However, we could no longer detect virus-positive samples in oral swabs, anal swabs and blood samples taken from these patients during the second sampling (Fig.	0

NewsClaims	2314	A clear trend was observed in the IgG and IgM titres, which increased over time, except that the IgM titre was decreased in the last sample (Fig.	0
NewsClaims	2315	2b).	0
NewsClaims	2316	As a second analysis, we tested samples from 5 of the 7 virus-positive patients around 20 days after disease onset for the presence of viral antibodies (Extended Data Tables 1, 2).	0
NewsClaims	2317	All patient samples—but not samples from healthy individuals—were strongly positive for viral IgG (Fig.	0
NewsClaims	2318	2b).	0
NewsClaims	2319	There were also three IgM-positive samples, indicating an acute infection.	0
NewsClaims	2320	We next successfully isolated the virus (called 2019-nCoV BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019) from both Vero E6 and Huh7 cells using the BALF sample of patient ICU-06.	0
NewsClaims	2321	Clear cytopathogenic effects were observed in cells after incubation for three days (Extended Data Fig.	0
NewsClaims	2322	6a, b).	0
NewsClaims	2323	The identity of the strain WIV04 was verified in Vero E6 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using the cross-reactive viral N antibody (Extended Data Fig.	0
NewsClaims	2324	6c, d) and by metagenomics sequencing, most of the reads of which mapped to 2019-nCoV, and qPCR analysis showed that the viral load increased from day 1 to day 3 (Extended Data Fig.	0

NewsClaims	2326	Viral particles in ultrathin sections of infected cells displayed a typical coronavirus morphology, as visualized by electron microscopy (Extended Data Fig.	0

NewsClaims	2328	To further confirm the neutralization activity of the viral IgG-positive samples, we conducted serum-neutralization assays in Vero E6 cells using the five patient sera that were IgG-positive.	0
NewsClaims	2329	We demonstrate that all samples were able to neutralize 100 TCID 50 (50% tissue-culture-infective dose) of 2019-nCoV at a dilution of 1:40–1:80.	0
NewsClaims	2330	We also show that this virus could be cross-neutralized by horse anti-SARS-CoV serum (gift from L.-F. Wang) at dilutions of 1:40; however, the potential for cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV antibodies needs to be confirmed with anti-SARS-CoV serum from humans (Extended Data Table 4).	0
NewsClaims	2331	ACE2 is known to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV14.	0
NewsClaims	2332	To determine whether 2019-nCoV also uses ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor, we conducted virus infectivity studies using HeLa cells that expressed or did not express ACE2 proteins from humans, Chinese horseshoe bats, civets, pigs and mice.	0
NewsClaims	2333	We show that 2019-nCoV is able to use all ACE2 proteins, except for mouse ACE2, as an entry receptor to enter ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells that did not express ACE2, indicating that ACE2 is probably the cell receptor through which 2019-nCoV enters cells (Fig.	0
NewsClaims	2334	3).	0
NewsClaims	2335	We also show that 2019-nCoV does not use other coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (Extended Data Fig.	0

NewsClaims	2345	The study provides a detailed report on 2019-nCoV, the likely aetiological agent responsible for the ongoing epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in China and other countries.	0
NewsClaims	2346	Virus-specific nucleotide-positive and viral-protein seroconversion was observed in all patients tested and provides evidence of an association between the disease and the presence of this virus.	0
NewsClaims	2347	However, there are still many urgent questions that remain to be answered.	0
NewsClaims	2348	The association between 2019-nCoV and the disease has not been verified by animal experiments to fulfil the Koch’s postulates to establish a causative relationship between a microorganism and a disease.	0
NewsClaims	2349	We do not yet know the transmission routine of this virus among hosts.	0
NewsClaims	2350	We should closely monitor whether the virus continues to evolve to become more virulent.	0
NewsClaims	2351	Finally, considering the wide spread of SARSr-CoV in their natural reservoirs, future research should be focused on active surveillance of these viruses for broader geographical regions.	0
NewsClaims	2352	In the long term, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and vaccines should be prepared for emerging infectious diseases that are caused by this cluster of viruses in the future.	0
NewsClaims	2353	Most importantly, strict regulations against the domestication and consumption of wildlife should be implemented.	0
NewsClaims	2354	Note added in proof: Since this paper was accepted, the ICTV has designated the virus as SARS-CoV-215; in addition, the WHO has released the official name of the disease caused by this virus, which is COVID-1916.	0

NewsClaims	2359	The practice of spreading disinformation about public health threats is nothing new.	0
NewsClaims	2360	"Experiments."""	0
NewsClaims	2361	Over several years, the false narrative was picked up by other media, before eventually making its way to the United States, including CBS Evening News.	0
NewsClaims	2362	In 1992, Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service admitted that Operation Infektion had been backed by the KGB.	0
NewsClaims	2363	A similar pattern of spreading disinformation appears to be evolving alongside the current outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	2364	While it is not as far along as Operation Infektion, the mechanisms available to spread narratives quickly are much larger and faster in today’s media environment than they were during the Cold War.	0
NewsClaims	2365	Multiple narratives get things rolling	0
NewsClaims	2366	The economic version of the narrative, published by Topcor.ru, suggested that the ongoing trade war with China has cost the U.S. billions of dollars, and the latter would benefit from the virus undermining the former’s economy.	0
NewsClaims	2367	The fringe outlet suggested that the outbreak is essentially a U.S. bioweaponry reconnaissance operation with the goal of testing the capabilities of Chinese biological weapons defenses.	0
NewsClaims	2368	Additional outlets referred to statements by pro-Kremlin military expert Igor Nikulin on	0
NewsClaims	2369	TV Zvezda	0
NewsClaims	2370	, who claimed that the appearance of the virus looked like sabotage.	0
NewsClaims	2371	According to Nikulin, the United States actively researches lethal disease vectors to test them within a population while simultaneously developing cures for them.	0

NewsClaims	2392	While Operation Infektion took years to spread, ultimately it sowed doubt regarding the origins of the AIDS virus.	0

NewsClaims	2395	No evidence flu vaccines make children more vulnerable to coronavirus infections	0
NewsClaims	2396	Copyright AFP 2017-2021.	0
NewsClaims	2397	All rights reserved.	0
NewsClaims	2398	Social media posts claim children vaccinated against the flu are at a significantly higher risk of contracting other respiratory infections, including coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	2399	This is false; large studies in British Columbia and the US found no evidence that the influenza vaccine increases the risk of contracting a coronavirus, and health officials throughout North America recommend the flu vaccine for children during the COVID-19 pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	2400	“Bombshell as flu shots found to cause huge increases in coronavirus infections,” says the headline of an article shared as a screenshot on July 31, 2020 on Facebook.	0
NewsClaims	2401	“Children who are vaccinated with flu shots have a 440 percent increase in risk of contradicting other respiratory infections such as coronavirus, researchers found in a published paper,” claims the post, which also circulated on Instagram.	0
NewsClaims	2402	Screenshot of a Facebook post taken on August 3, 2020	0
NewsClaims	2403	Several posts claim the evidence came from “The British Medical Journal,” sharing this link.	0
NewsClaims	2404	However, that is not a scientific study, but rather a response to an article about the COVID-19 pandemic from a retired pediatrician.	0
NewsClaims	2405	BMJ executive editor Theodora Bloom explained in an email that “Rapid responses” are comments to the editors that appear on the journal’s website but “are not indexed in PubMed and they are not journal articles.”	0
NewsClaims	2406	“Although we moderate Rapid Responses to ensure they are not libellous, for example, they are certainly not endorsed by the publication,” she said.	0
NewsClaims	2407	Another version of the post reveals that the source of the claim is an article on the website NaturalNews, one of a network of internet domains found to host health disinformation which AFP has fact-checked in the past.	0
NewsClaims	2408	NaturalNews was removed from Facebook in May 2020 “for spammy and abusive behavior, not the content they posted,” according to a Facebook spokeswoman.	0
NewsClaims	2409	“They misled people about the popularity of their posts and relied on content farms in Macedonia and the Philippines.”	0
NewsClaims	2410	Screenshot of a Facebook post taken on August 3, 2020	0
NewsClaims	2411	Brian Ward, professor in the McGill University Department of Medicine, said in an email that the claim has been “cherry-picked from a very weak study.”	0
NewsClaims	2412	It is based on a 2012 study titled: “Increased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine.”	0
NewsClaims	2413	The study was conducted from 2008-2009, a decade before the novel coronavirus pandemic, and only included 115 children during one flu season.	0
NewsClaims	2414	It found that over nine months, the children in the group that received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine “had an increased risk of virologically-confirmed non-influenza infections.”	0
NewsClaims	2415	Ward explained that the study, though published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, has methodological flaws, including having 1.5 times more children in the flu vaccine group, compared to the placebo group.	0
NewsClaims	2416	Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Medicine, also said in an email that it is important not to overstate the findings of a small study.	0
NewsClaims	2417	Gilbert further explained: “It isn’t that the flu shot directly made children more susceptible to other viruses.”	0
NewsClaims	2418	She said the children in the placebo group who were not vaccinated were more likely to get the flu and there seemed to be short-term protection from other viruses right after recovering from the flu.	0
NewsClaims	2419	Based on this study, “no-one should make decisions to avoid flu vaccinations,” Gilbert said.	0
NewsClaims	2420	Flu shot and coronavirus risk	0
NewsClaims	2421	Danuta Skowronski, the principal investigator at the British Columbia Center for Disease Control (BCCDC), published a study in May 2020 that included thousands of people over multiple flu seasons in Canada.	0
NewsClaims	2422	It found the “influenza vaccine did not affect seasonal coronavirus risk.”	0
NewsClaims	2423	Skowronski, who plays a critical role in Canada’s national influenza program, helped develop test negative design, a methodology used worldwide to monitor how well the influenza vaccine protects.	0
NewsClaims	2424	Asked if there was any particular coronavirus risk to children who receive the flu shot, Skowronski said: “We saw no association in children nor in adults between the receipt of influenza vaccine and coronavirus risk.”	0
NewsClaims	2425	Similarly, a 2013 study conducted in the US state of Wisconsin covering six flu seasons and including more than 3,000 patients found: “Influenza vaccination was not associated with detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses.”	0
NewsClaims	2426	Claims that a 2017 study also found the flu shot left people vulnerable to infections were also shown to be misleading by AFP Fact Check here.	0
NewsClaims	2427	Flu shot recommended	0
NewsClaims	2428	The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has not yet voted on the flu vaccine recommendations for 2020-2021, but Lisa Black, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), said in an email that AAP has not changed its guidance because of the pandemic and “recommends that everyone over 6 months is vaccinated for influenza.”	0
NewsClaims	2429	The same is true of the Canadian Paediatric Society.	0
NewsClaims	2430	Spokeswoman Genevieve Brouillette said in an email: “Our general guidance (that everyone over 6 months of age be immunized against the seasonal flu) won’t be changing.”	0
NewsClaims	2431	The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that how and where people get a flu vaccine may need to change due to the COVID-19 pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	2432	The flu shot is a regular target of disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	2433	AFP Fact Check has debunked the false claim that the vaccine contains coronaviruses, the false claim that receiving a flu shot will make you test positive for COVID-19, and false ingredient lists for the annual immunization.	0
NewsClaims	2434	Note: The objective of this report is to provide a snapshot overview of the current trends and insights into disinformation activities related to COVID-19/Coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	2435	It does not provide a comprehensive or complete overview and focusses primarily on the external dimension, in line with the European External Action Service (eeas) mandate.	0
NewsClaims	2436	The report was authored by the EEAS Strategic Communications and Information Analysis Division, which contributes to the EU’s efforts to counter disinformation, including through detection, analysis and exposure of disinformation campaigns.	0
NewsClaims	2437	In addressing disinformation and identifying and analysing disinformation surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the EEAS is working closely with the European Commission, European Parliament services and EU Member States.	0
NewsClaims	2438	The EEAS also cooperates on this issue with international partners (G7, NATO and non-state actors).	0
NewsClaims	2439	The results are regularly published on EUvsDisinfo.eu and social media channels.	0
NewsClaims	2440	Insights are shared with EU institutions and EU Member States in real time, including through the Rapid Alert System on Disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	2441	SUMMARY	0
NewsClaims	2442	In line with the previous EEAS Special Reports and based on publicly available information, this edition gives an overview of recent developments around COVID-19 related disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	2443	The report focusses on foreign state and non-state actors trying to exploit the uncertainty in societies as well as people’s fears and insecurities to advance their own agenda.	0
NewsClaims	2444	While misinformation and disinformation[1] relating to issues surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have continued to spread across the globe, the volume has – according to our findings – shown at least a temporary decrease during the period observed, alongside a general downward trend on COVID-19 related web searches[2].	0
NewsClaims	2445	There is a crystallizing and clustering around specific topics and narratives: alleged links between COVID-19 and 5G networks; COVID-19 restrictions as pretext establishing global domination of secretive elites; and attacks on individuals engaged in the development of vaccines, especially Bill Gates.	0
NewsClaims	2446	External actors, notably pro-Kremlin sources, are still involved in spreading disinformation, including by amplifying existing conspiracy theories, which link the COVID-19 pandemic to biological warfare, 5G technology and fuel anti-vaccination sentiment.	0
NewsClaims	2447	The efforts of state actors like China to deflect blame, to use the pandemic to promote their own governmental system and enhance their image abroad continue.	0
NewsClaims	2448	The claim that there are clandestine US biological laboratories on the territory of “former Soviet republics”[3] has been spread both by pro-Kremlin outlets as well as Chinese officials and state media.	0
NewsClaims	2449	Disinformation around COVID-19 has real world consequences.	0
NewsClaims	2450	It has become clear that disinformation is not just a potential health risk when false cures are propagated.	0
NewsClaims	2451	The spread of false information pertaining to the 5G network has also led to multiple arson attacks on telecommunication infrastructure across Europe.	0
NewsClaims	2452	[4]	0
NewsClaims	2453	In some regions and countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is used to restrict freedom of speech and freedom of the media.	0
NewsClaims	2454	The EEAS has observed numerous cases in which governments or state officials have used the crisis to curtail media freedoms.	0
NewsClaims	2455	The work of independent media and fact-checkers is crucial to deliver reliable and authoritative information about the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	2456	Continued threats and harassment against fact-checkers and fact-checking organisations are being observed.	0
NewsClaims	2457	Social media companies continue to invest into detecting and countering misinformation and disinformation on their platforms.	0
NewsClaims	2458	While the efforts are commendable, it is clear that much more needs to be done.	0
NewsClaims	2459	In detail: COVID-19 related disinformation, propaganda and other activities (April 23 – 18 May)	0
NewsClaims	2460	Disinformation and propaganda around COVID-19	0
NewsClaims	2461	As the previous reports, this one focusses specifically on recent activities related to foreign state and non-state actors.	0
NewsClaims	2462	Foreign actors have been trying to exploit citizens’ fears, insecurities and concerns for their own agenda, which must be distinguished from the legitimate democratic debate where citizens voice concerns and criticism in connection with the pandemic and measures taken by governments	0
NewsClaims	2463	The information environment relating to COVID-19 continues to be crowded with disinformation and while many of the targets (the West as such, the EU and NATO, the United States) and themes remain the same, new targets have emerged, notably Bill and Melinda Gates and the Gates Foundation.	0
NewsClaims	2464	Pro-Kremlin media outlets continue to disinform about COVID-19, however the intensity of the disinformation campaign seems to have decreased[5].	0
NewsClaims	2465	Overall, the EUvsDisinfo database now contains nearly 500 examples of COVID-19-related pro-Kremlin disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	2466	Although pro-Kremlin disinformation messages about EU actions in response to COVID-19 and EU solidarity continue to circulate, at least three English-language pro-Kremlin outlets reduced the number of COVID-19 related articles since the second half of April, compared to late March and the beginning of April.	0
NewsClaims	2467	One of those outlets, “South Front”[6], has even removed a dedicated section on COVID-19 from its website.	0
NewsClaims	2468	According to recent reports in Dutch media[7], the General Intelligence and Security service of the Netherlands has determined that Russian narratives about COVID-19 were shared in a number of Dutch-speaking social media groups.	0
NewsClaims	2469	The narratives emphasized alleged lack of European solidarity in the field of COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2470	Such findings are largely consistent with prominent pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about COVID-19, reported by EUvsDisinfo.eu.	0
NewsClaims	2471	Inside Russia, state-controlled channels continue to report on the domestic situation, acknowledging that COVID-19 is a complex challenge, including for Russia.	0
NewsClaims	2472	At the same time, some state-controlled media outlets continue to spread false information about Bill Gates and vaccines; however in at least one case another state-run media outlet has called this out as “conspiracy theories” and challenged it[8].	0
NewsClaims	2473	Russia’s state-controlled TV channels also used the broader COVID-19 situation to advance earlier-established disinformation narratives about the collapse of “perverse” Western values[9] (i.e.	0
NewsClaims	2474	no one in Europe demands gay parades anymore) and abandonment of Ukraine (“the West have disposed of Ukraine like trash”)[10].	0
NewsClaims	2475	In line with our previous analysis, China’s general aim of controlling the narrative on COVID-19 and deflecting any criticism of the country is still present.	0
NewsClaims	2476	China – “having made sacrifices to buy time for the rest of the world”[11] – is portrayed as a responsible and transparent actor in the pandemic and a model for other countries to follow.	0
NewsClaims	2477	In parallel, where established facts or prevailing narratives could be seen as unfavourable to China or could support criticism of Chinese authorities there seems to be the effort of creating doubt in relation to those.	0
NewsClaims	2478	For example, creating doubts about China’s role in the COVID-19 outbreak[12] and countering international calls for an independent inquiry into the origins of the outbreak of the virus in China[13].	0
NewsClaims	2479	At the same time, there has been a shift towards more directly challenging and mocking[14] the US administration and its response to the pandemic[15].	0
NewsClaims	2480	China’s state-run media has been implying a US cover-up[16] and demanding answers from the country[17].	0
NewsClaims	2481	Multiple Russian state-controlled media channels, including RIA Novosti news agency and RT[18], explicitly defended China in face of international criticism of handing the COVID-19 outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	2482	EU-sanctioned TV host and media manager Dmitry Kiselyov compared criticism of the Chinese government to Russia being held responsible for the chemical attack in Salisbury[19] and meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections[20] – referring to two prominent pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives.	0
NewsClaims	2483	Multiple pro-Kremlin outlets have reported (in Russian, French and English) about alleged clandestine US biological laboratories in Ukraine.	0
NewsClaims	2484	The implication behind such disinformation messages is that the US is afraid of leakage[21] of infectious substances on its own territory, that such labs facilitated the US support for Euromaidan[22] that epidemics[23] start around the labs, and more directly that COVID-19 might have been created in one of the labs in Ukraine[24].	0
NewsClaims	2485	These type of messages build on a prominent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the “secret military laboratories”, most notably in the case of Lugar lab in Georgia.	0
NewsClaims	2486	As such, they are easily replicated throughout the region: in Armenia, Georgia, Moldova[25].	0
NewsClaims	2487	The same conspiracy theory about US biological laboratories in former Soviet republics has been also spread by Chinese officials and state media.	0
NewsClaims	2488	This started with statements of a Russian Foreign ministry spokesperson[26] in mid-April, which were later referred to by a Chinese MFA spokesperson[27].	0
NewsClaims	2489	It has been tweeted more than once by an official account of the Chinese MFA[28] and covered by China’s state-run media[29].	0
NewsClaims	2490	RT Russian in turn published an article quoting concerns[30] of a representative of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs about these alleged laboratories[31].	0
NewsClaims	2491	The messaging by Chinese officials and media talk about the need to address “concerns from local people and surrounding countries” or “international concerns”.	0
NewsClaims	2492	The US biolab theory has become embedded into Chinese state media articles implying a wider cover-up by the US[32].	0
NewsClaims	2493	Nature magazine has reported[33] that Chinese state media[34] and officials[35] have been heavily promoting unproven traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) as treatments for COVID-19, including highlighting the sending of TCM to third countries as international aid.	0
NewsClaims	2494	[36] However, there is currently no scientific proof of any medicine preventing or curing COVID-19, a fact also confirmed by the WHO[37].	0
NewsClaims	2495	Freedom House has stated in their overview of Chinese activities[38] that “since March, coordinated and covert attempts by China-linked actors to manipulate information—particularly regarding COVID-19” have been detected in a number of countries, with content often delivered in local languages.	0
NewsClaims	2496	The analysis also highlights a departure from Beijing’s more traditional model of positive propaganda combined with suppression of criticism.	0
NewsClaims	2497	That expanding nature of the Chinese influence toolbox – including a more confrontational tone and “Russian-style disinformation tactics” – has been also noted by other analysts[39] and illustrated by various cases[40] mentioned in our current and previous reports.	0
NewsClaims	2498	The Syrian regime is further advancing its disinformation campaign against sanctions claiming that Western countries are perpetrating an “economic war” against Syria and the Syrian people and that sanctions have crippled the health sector and are impeding the country’s response to COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2499	This was reiterated by Assad claiming that COVID-19 comes in addition to “an economic challenge, which we have been facing as a result of over nine years and unjust sanctions imposed on our people”[41].	0
NewsClaims	2500	Prior to that, the regime’s political representative to the UN further advanced this narrative at a meeting of the UNSC on the humanitarian situation in Syria, claiming that “illegitimate economic measures prevent the medical and health bodies in Syria to obtain the necessary equipment for the test, diagnosis and prevention and treatment of COVID-19”.	0
NewsClaims	2501	[42]	0
NewsClaims	2502	Terrorist groups have been calling for an opportunistic use of the chaos and distraction caused by COVID-19 to perpetrate attacks.	0
NewsClaims	2503	This narrative has raised security and stability implications since it materialised in an increased number of attacks in conflict areas (e.g.	0
NewsClaims	2504	Syria, Iraq) widely reported in the media[43].	0
NewsClaims	2505	When it comes to adverse narratives, the Global Coalition noted that COVID-19 is being described by Da’esh as a retribution for its activities in Iraq and Syria.	0
NewsClaims	2506	An intense appearance of COVID-19 related mis- and disinformation was observed across the Western Balkans, together with an increased activity of local fact-checkers contributing to awareness raising and opening public debate on the issue both locally and internationally.	0
NewsClaims	2507	Local independent fact-checkers are confirming cases of the spread of pseudo-science, conspiracy theories etc., including in relation to health advice and to the alleged impact of 5G networks on COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2508	[44]	0
NewsClaims	2509	Bill Gates[45] and the Gates Foundation have been attacked by multiple actors throughout the last months.	0
NewsClaims	2510	Similar to other private organisations, they are accused of sinister intentions, like seeking global domination[46].	0
NewsClaims	2511	Building on top of these accusations, multilateral initiatives like the Global Pledging effort[47], which partners with private actors, are accused of generating money not for the fight against COVID-19, but to further their private interests.	0
NewsClaims	2512	The COVID-19 pandemic is also used to undermine NATO presence in the Baltic States[48].	0
NewsClaims	2513	A sophisticated influence operation, jointly targeting NATO, media, fact-checkers and state-institutions in the Baltic States[49], is an example of how the pandemic is instrumentalised in attempts to sow distrust among Western partners and intimidate individual voices of the press.	0
NewsClaims	2514	The disinformation narratives used in such influence operations are consistent with those in pro-Kremlin media outlets, as observed by EUvsDisinfo[50].	0
NewsClaims	2515	Update: Social media platforms	0
NewsClaims	2516	Actions taken by the platforms	0
NewsClaims	2517	Twitter announced it would grant researchers access to a real-time data stream of “tens of millions of daily public tweets about COVID-19”, to track misinformation and disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	2518	Twitter said that any developer or researcher with an approved Twitter developer account can apply for access to the COVID-19 stream if they meet certain criteria and the data is used for “the public good.” Twitter said it had never offered a full stream on a particular topic before.	0
NewsClaims	2519	[51] Additionally, Twitter announced that they are introducing “new labels and warning messages that will provide additional context and information on some Tweets containing disputed or misleading information related to COVID-19”.	0
NewsClaims	2520	[52]	0
NewsClaims	2521	Facebook announced in their April 2020 Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour Report[53] that it took down 8 networks for coordinated inauthentic behaviour in April.	0
NewsClaims	2522	Six of them (in the US, Georgia, Myanmar and Mauritania) focussed on domestic audiences.	0
NewsClaims	2523	However, the other two were taken down for foreign interference, with one network emanating from Russia, and one from Iran.	0
NewsClaims	2524	Facebook[54] removed numerous assets of outlets “News Front”[55] and “South Front”[56] (followed by over 270 thousand users) for coordinated inauthentic behaviour on behalf of a foreign entity.	0
NewsClaims	2525	Ahead of the Facebook takedown, EUvsDisinfo exposed[57] these outlets as disseminating pro-Kremlin disinformation on multiple topics, including conspiracy theories about COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines and the global response[58].	0
NewsClaims	2526	According to Facebook, the coordinated inauthentic activity originated in Russia, the non-government controlled areas in Donbas region and Crimea.	0
NewsClaims	2527	“News Front” has previously been linked to the Russian security services (see: reporting by the DFR Lab[59] and Zeit[60]).	0
NewsClaims	2528	Poynter’s Coronavirus Facts Alliance accounts for over 5.000 COVID-19 related fact-checks since February 2020[61], which signifies a significant burden.	0
NewsClaims	2529	Facebook reported labelling about 50 million pieces of content related to COVID-19 on their platform alone with warnings, based on around 7,500 articles by their independent fact-checking partners[62].	0
NewsClaims	2530	Platforms are also still vulnerable to being the tool for viral distribution of false information and conspiracy theories.	0
NewsClaims	2531	In the beginning of May, for example, a pseudo-documentary[63] containing multiple cases of false, misleading and harmful claims spread with high velocity across the internet.	0
NewsClaims	2532	It was first uploaded to YouTube and amplified by conspiracy groups on Facebook[64], gaining millions of views within only a few days.	0
NewsClaims	2533	YouTube and Facebook have removed the “Plandemic” scene, saying that it spread inaccurate information about Covid-19 that could be harmful to the public.	0
NewsClaims	2534	However, the video continued to circulate, as people post new copies.	0
NewsClaims	2535	[65] This shows that further and continued efforts by the platforms are necessary beyond the Code of Practice[66] and as outlined in the previous edition of this report.	0
NewsClaims	2536	Independent research on social media platforms	0
NewsClaims	2537	Bellingcat[67] has discovered an ongoing information operation on Twitter and Facebook using a network of bots made up of newly created and stolen accounts.	0
NewsClaims	2538	The network is pushing topics supportive of the Chinese government and critical of either popular figures or protestors who are against it.	0
NewsClaims	2539	Bellingcat claims that the “content of the accounts correlates with findings made in the past, both by Twitter[68] and other entities[69], of state-linked information operations that are being run out of People’s Republic of China.”	0
NewsClaims	2540	The Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, that has previously researched the broad COVID-19 related censorship on Chinese social media platforms[70], has discovered that communications among international users of WeChat – the most popular social media platform in China and third in the world – are subject to surveillance that was previously thought to be exclusively reserved for China-based accounts[71].	0
NewsClaims	2541	Documents and images transmitted among non-China-registered accounts are monitored for content that is politically sensitive in China and then used to invisibly train WeChat’s Chinese online censorship system.	0
NewsClaims	2542	Earlier research had found that all users who have registered their WeChat accounts with a Chinese phone number are subject to Chinese online censorship regime wherever they are located in the world, even if they have later changed their account to a non-Chinese phone number[72].	0
NewsClaims	2543	This export of Chinese online censorship has raised questions about its role on politics in other countries[73].	0
NewsClaims	2544	The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) has reported a growing significance and impact of Chinese non-state actors on Western social media platforms.	0
NewsClaims	2545	Across March and April, “a loosely coordinated pro-China trolling campaign on Twitter harassed Western media outlets, impersonated Taiwanese users in an effort to undermine Taiwan’s position with the World Health Organization (WHO), spread false information about the COVID-19 outbreak, and joined in pre-existing inauthentic social media campaigns”.	0
NewsClaims	2546	[74]	0
NewsClaims	2547	Data from the Hamilton dashboard of GMF’s Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) shows that there has been a marked increase in the number of posts by Chinese officials on Twitter – from up to 4000 posts in December 2019 to 17.000 tweets in April since the COVID-19 crisis began in early 2020[75].	0
NewsClaims	2548	Twitter is blocked in China.	0
NewsClaims	2549	ASD also found that COVID-19 related messaging on Chinese state media, government and diplomatic Twitter accounts in the end of April and beginning of May were attacking the United States for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, accused Washington of spreading conspiracy theories and framed China as a victim of “scapegoating” from the West.	0
NewsClaims	2550	Other messaging signalled China’s return to normalcy, while highlighting the negative effects the virus is having inside the United States.	0
NewsClaims	2551	[76]	0
NewsClaims	2552	Media freedom	0
NewsClaims	2553	Since mid-March 2020, media watchdogs have drawn attention to numerous cases in which governments have used the crisis to curtail media freedoms, including in the Eastern Partnership countries and Russia, Western Balkans, and the Southern Neighbourhood.	0
NewsClaims	2554	Across the entire Neighbourhood, media are facing restrictions on access to public information and censorship.	0
NewsClaims	2555	Journalists and bloggers are facing threats, harassment and physical violence.	0
NewsClaims	2556	Moreover, the economic downfall has caused additional financial challenge for the already cash-stripped media sector due to reduced revenues from advertising.	0
NewsClaims	2557	This puts the political or economic neutrality of the concerned media outlets at risk, and increases vulnerabilities to malign foreign influence.	0
NewsClaims	2558	Numerous institutions have called for greater respect of media freedoms and an emergency financial assistance to independent media in times of COVID-19[77], including Amnesty International[78], Reporters Without Borders[79] and International Federation of Journalists[80].	0
NewsClaims	2559	İfade Özgürlüğü Derneği[81] (Freedom of Expression Association, an organisation conducting research projects on internet censorship, academic freedom, press freedom and artistic expression) reported on 3 May on[82] that as of May 2020, 415,000 websites and 140,000 URL addresses have been blocked in Turkey, observing a “continued increase in internet censorship” since the outbreak of the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	2560	42,000 tweets, 7,200 Twitter accounts, 12,450 YouTube videos and 6,500 Facebook posts have also been blocked.	0
NewsClaims	2561	A Novaya Gazeta article[83] on the COVID-19 situation in the region of Chechnya was removed following the order of the Russian government; the journalist Elena Milashina herself had faced physical attacks and threats.	0
NewsClaims	2562	Later, Russian authorities allowed Novaya Gazeta to publish a censored version of the article – a section of which was replaced by a black square.	0
NewsClaims	2563	The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the New York Times and the Financial Times of making anti-Russia allegations by misrepresenting the statistics of new COVID-19 infections.	0
NewsClaims	2564	According to the ministry, the outlets made a “politically engaged attempt, to shift public attention from domestic troubles to yet another sensational anti-Russia fake news item”[84].	0
NewsClaims	2565	The ministry said[85] it would send letters to the editorial boards of the New York Times and the Financial Times over their reporting that Russia is undercounting and underreporting COVID-19 deaths, and ask them to publish refutations prepared by the Russian authorities.	0
NewsClaims	2566	The ministry would also contact the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media and UNESCO Director-General, and will notify the UN Secretariat.	0
NewsClaims	2567	According to reporting, this might even lead to a loss of accreditation for those media outlets in Russia, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova saying that “[further] steps will depend on whether they publish retractions”.	0
NewsClaims	2568	[86]	0
NewsClaims	2569	Looking at China, there are media reports of strengthening suppression of information about China’s handling of the COVID-19 outbreak[87].	0
NewsClaims	2570	An increasingly strong enforcement of internet censorship goes beyond merely blocking or deleting unwanted information from online platforms and includes intimidation, detainment and other real world reprisals against internet users by security officials[88].	0
NewsClaims	2571	Concerning China’s domestic media, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has stated that “Beijing has used the crisis to further tighten its control of the media, banning the publication of any reports that question how it has been managed.	0
NewsClaims	2572	This has been made easier since state and privately-owned media organizations are all strictly controlled by the Communist Party”.	0
NewsClaims	2573	[89] China is ranked 177th out of 180 countries in RSF’s 2020 World Press Freedom index.	0
NewsClaims	2574	[90]	0
NewsClaims	2575	19 foreign journalists have been expelled or forced to leave China in the past 12 months[91], the majority of them during the COVID-19 pandemic[92].	0
NewsClaims	2576	In the case of three Wall Street Journal reporters, COVID-19 related coverage was invoked as the justification for the expulsion by the Chinese authorities[93].	0
NewsClaims	2577	Restrictions on foreign correspondents limit the availability of independent information that could be useful in understanding and assessing the measures taken in bringing the outbreak under control in the first country severely affected.	0
NewsClaims	2578	Expulsions of foreign journalists is, however, a long-term the issue that goes beyond the COVID-19 crisis.	0
NewsClaims	2579	The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC) annual survey for 2019[94] also found that “Chinese authorities increasingly use the threat of expulsion and visa denial to retaliate and warn against critical foreign coverage; summon journalists to meetings with officials; and harass Chinese citizens who work for the foreign press.”	0

NewsClaims	2680	Editor's Note: U.S. Masters Swimming has posted an updated version of this article.	0
NewsClaims	2681	Many pools and gyms are closing in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19, a virus that has upended daily life for millions of people around the globe.	0
NewsClaims	2682	With lots of conflicting advice and misinformation floating around in cyberspace, we reached out to an expert, Roberta Lavin, a professor of medicine at the University of Tennessee’s College of Nursing, for guidance on how you can safely navigate these uncharted waters.	0
NewsClaims	2683	(Here's some information on when you might be able to swim again and some resources for swimmers who are out of the water.)	0
NewsClaims	2684	Can COVID-19 be transmitted via water?	0
NewsClaims	2685	These droplets can speed undetected from person to person, causing an infection after the virus enters a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth.	0
NewsClaims	2686	Though this is the typical means of transmission, science is still sorting out the particulars of this new, or novel, coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	2687	“The question remains about all the modes of transmission, which we don’t know at this point.	0
NewsClaims	2688	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on March 10 that “the COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking water.	0
NewsClaims	2689	Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.”	0
NewsClaims	2690	Does chlorine in pool water inactivate the virus?	0
NewsClaims	2691	Assuming that your pool is properly maintained, the disinfecting chemicals in the water should be enough to render the virus inactive.	0
NewsClaims	2692	If chlorine inactivates the virus, can I go swim?	0
NewsClaims	2693	“I think of all the things you could do, swimming is probably safer than most activities,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	2694	But because most pools are housed inside a gym facility or other public space, that presents possibilities for infection before you ever reach the chlorinated water.	0
NewsClaims	2695	“You have to assume that people are infected,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	2696	“Anything they touch would be contaminated.	0
NewsClaims	2697	It would be hard to get in and out of the pool without touching anything or interacting with another person.”	0
NewsClaims	2698	Think about it: How many surfaces do you touch on a normal visit to and from the pool?	0
NewsClaims	2699	You’re reaching for a door handle and using the card scanner or otherwise signing in.	0
NewsClaims	2700	You’re getting changed and putting your clothes in a locker or on a bench.	0
NewsClaims	2701	You’re touching a communal shower tap.	0
NewsClaims	2702	If you use the restroom, that’s a whole other series of doors and surfaces to navigate.	0
NewsClaims	2703	There’s plenty of places for a tiny, invisible virus to cling to and follow you home where it might infect you or a loved one.	0
NewsClaims	2704	Emerging research suggests that the coronavirus can survive on hard surfaces like plastic and steel for up to three days.	0
NewsClaims	2705	It may also hang in the air in tiny droplets called aerosols for up to a half an hour, at which time it can settle on surfaces.	0
NewsClaims	2706	If you’re planning to take part in an organized Masters workout, it's probably best that you don't.	0
NewsClaims	2707	When several swimmers get into a lane together to complete an interval workout, there’s the inevitable few moments at the wall (often while breathing heavily) in proximity to one another that can be a prime opportunity for viral transmission if one of you is carrying the virus.	0
NewsClaims	2708	And not everyone who has the virus shows signs of infection.	0
NewsClaims	2709	Theoretically, if you could go swim laps alone without touching any surfaces or coming into contact with another person, it might be safe to do so.	0
NewsClaims	2710	“If swimmers were in a large Olympic-style pool swimming laps and there was one swimmer in every other lane, then they are probably 6 feet apart,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	2711	But when was the last time you had that sort of arrangement at your local Masters practice?	0
NewsClaims	2712	“And there’s another problem.	0
NewsClaims	2713	Part of our nature is to say, ‘Oh, no.	0
NewsClaims	2714	I’m not getting sick,’ and you deny that it could be a possibility.	0
NewsClaims	2715	And you go out and push through,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	2716	“I think that’s one of the big problems for a lot of people, especially athletes.	0
NewsClaims	2717	You deny that it could possibly be an injury or that you could possibly be sick and you’re going to soldier on through it.	0
NewsClaims	2718	This is not the time to do that.”	0
NewsClaims	2719	Is swimming in open water a better option?	0
NewsClaims	2720	It’s often been said that the solution to pollution is dilution, and that may be true here, too, Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	2721	“Because of the flow of the water and the amount of dilution in a larger body of water such as a lake or river, the virus would not be a concern.	0
NewsClaims	2722	The bigger concern there is that you shouldn’t be swimming in a lake or river by yourself.	0
NewsClaims	2723	And, of course, with social distancing, the goal is to keep people 6 or more feet away from each other.”	0
NewsClaims	2724	Also, across much of the United States, open water venues are only beginning to thaw or are still very cold, which presents the potential for hypothermia if you’re swimming for too long.	0
NewsClaims	2725	Proceed with caution or find alternative means of working out at home.	0
NewsClaims	2726	U.S. Masters Swimming has canceled Spring Nationals and is recommending LMSCs and clubs not to have events until at least May 10.	0
NewsClaims	2727	Is that a good idea?	0
NewsClaims	2728	“It’s an excellent idea,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	2729	“We should have been [canceling large gatherings] sooner probably.” The reason is because of this particular virus’s highly contagious nature.	0
NewsClaims	2730	“We are now fairly certain people are contagious before they ever have symptoms, so they are spreading that virus all over the place before they have any symptoms.	0
NewsClaims	2731	All it takes is a couple of people in an environment in close contact like that” to widen the pandemic, Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	2732	“The average person is spreading the virus to 2.5 more people.	0
NewsClaims	2733	If you put people in an environment like a large gathering and then everyone goes home, they take the virus back home with them and infect others in their community.”	0
NewsClaims	2734	This creates an ongoing cycle of transmission and infection that becomes very difficult to manage.	0
NewsClaims	2735	The CDC has also recommended a cancelation or postponement of all events with 50 or more people, and President Donald Trump went a step further and recommended avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people.	0
NewsClaims	2736	Many Masters meets and open water swims, as well as workouts, easily surpass those totals.	0
NewsClaims	2737	What does it mean to ‘flatten the curve?’	0
NewsClaims	2738	“You keep hearing people talk about ‘flattening the curve,’” Lavin says, referring to a means of reducing the catastrophic potential of COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2739	“Part of the purpose of that is to reduce cases a bit, but it’s also to slow the spread so that hospitals will be able to handle patients.	0
NewsClaims	2740	If we keep the spread down below the number of hospital beds and ICU beds, we can provide excellent treatment and more people will live.	0
NewsClaims	2741	If it gets above the number of available hospital beds and ICU beds and doctors and nurses, then we provide poor treatment.”	0
NewsClaims	2742	In addition, the strain on frontline caregivers is significant and grows with each additional transmission.	0
NewsClaims	2743	“Healthcare workers are at greater risk” of infection themselves when they are overwhelmed with patients, Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	2744	“When they’re tired, they can’t keep up” with safety protocols, such as changing masks and gowns as frequently as they should.	0
NewsClaims	2745	“When people get tired, they make mistakes.”	0
NewsClaims	2746	And if a whole rush of people become ill all at once, that also leads to some difficult decisions for health care workers about who should receive lifesaving care and who might have to go without in times of limited resources.	0
NewsClaims	2747	“Right now, we don’t have enough people or protective gear” to respond adequately to a mass-infection situation, she says.	0
NewsClaims	2748	Therefore, it’s critical that we flatten the curve by following CDC guidelines and reducing person-to-person contact.	0
NewsClaims	2749	These guidelines state:	0
NewsClaims	2750	Wash with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds each time.	0
NewsClaims	2751	Avoid touching your face, particularly your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.	0
NewsClaims	2752	Avoid close contact with people who are sick or who may have been exposed to the virus.	0
NewsClaims	2753	Stay at least 6 feet away from others.	0
NewsClaims	2754	These recommendations are particularly important for those who are at higher risk of infection, including older adults and those with a chronic medical condition such as heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease.	0
NewsClaims	2755	Stay home if you’re sick.	0
NewsClaims	2756	If you develop symptoms or think you may have been exposed to the virus, call your healthcare provider for advice.	0
NewsClaims	2757	Do not go directly to the office or the emergency room.	0
NewsClaims	2758	Call first and ask for guidance.	0
NewsClaims	2759	Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue (or cough or sneeze into your elbow or upper arm).	0
NewsClaims	2760	Throw used tissues in the trash and immediately wash your hands thoroughly.	0
NewsClaims	2761	If you are sick and must go out in public, wear a face mask.	0
NewsClaims	2762	If you are not sick, skip the face mask so that more supplies will be available to healthcare workers and others who truly need these devices.	0
NewsClaims	2763	(Editor's Note, May 9: This guidance from the CDC has changed since this article was originally published on March 19.	0
NewsClaims	2764	The CDC now recommends that everyone wear a cloth face covering when going out in public to reduce the risk of asymptomatic transmission of the virus.)	0
NewsClaims	2765	Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily.	0
NewsClaims	2766	This includes doorknobs, tables, countertops, handles, light switches, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, and any other high-traffic surfaces.	0
NewsClaims	2767	Rubbing alcohol, diluted bleach, and hydrogen peroxide can all disinfect surfaces.	0
NewsClaims	2768	Is there anything else you want Masters swimmers to know to keep themselves safe?	0
NewsClaims	2769	“I would say that to the extent that you’re in an area where you can swim outside, do so in small groups while keeping more than 6 feet between each other,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	2770	“I think that is probably at this point a safe thing to do.	0
NewsClaims	2771	But swimming in the pool, the problem is you’re going to have to go into the gym and touch doors and benches and change clothes.	0
NewsClaims	2772	It’s probably just better not to.”	0
NewsClaims	2773	But you don’t have to become a couch potato either.	0
NewsClaims	2774	In fact, in these stressful and uncertain times, it’s more important than ever to get regular physical exercise.	0
NewsClaims	2775	Recommit to your at-home dryland training routine using free weights, resistance bands, or whatever materials you have at home.	0
NewsClaims	2776	And if you’re permitted to, take advantage of getting out into fresh air.	0
NewsClaims	2777	“It’s spring.	0
NewsClaims	2778	It’s beautiful out.	0
NewsClaims	2779	It’s a great time to go for a walk,” Lavin says.	0
NewsClaims	2780	False claims and misinformation about coronavirus cures have circulated on social media as people search for hope and good news during the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	2781	One viral claim about alkaline diets – eliminating foods that are high in acidity to change the body's pH levels – has been shared on various occasions, and has also been debunked multiple times.	0
NewsClaims	2782	The pH of the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	2783	The post cited research from the Journal of Virology from the American Society for Microbiology.	0
NewsClaims	2784	Though an article about a coronavirus and pH was published in the journal in April 1991, the abstract makes it clear that the study was about a different coronavirus, the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus type 4, or MHV4.	0
NewsClaims	2785	The journal doesn't claim that the MHV4 virus has a specific pH level or range.	0
NewsClaims	2786	Rather, the study looks at what happens when mice or rat cells are infected with MHV4 at pH levels ranging from 5.5 to 8.5.	0
NewsClaims	2787	That is incorrect.	0
NewsClaims	2788	The study cited in the post is unrelated to the new coronavirus, because COVID-19 was unknown until the current outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	2789	The body regulates pH levels, meaning that diets don't change the pH levels of blood cells or tissues.	0
NewsClaims	2790	"An analysis by the MD Anderson Center about the relationship between alkaline diets and pH levels explained that a dietary change may result in a pH shift in saliva or urine, because these are waste products, but ""there’s no way you could ever eat enough that it really impacts your blood."""	0
NewsClaims	2791	Alkaline foods and the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	2792	Eating more alkaline foods is not a proven preventive measure or cure for the coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	2793	Though a healthy diet can help strengthen an immune system, there is no proof that an alkaline diet specifically is beneficial.	0
NewsClaims	2794	The Facebook post incorrectly states the pH levels of some of the listed foods.	0
NewsClaims	2795	The post listed lemons with a pH of 9.9 and limes with a pH of 8.2, when they both have a pH level of 2 to 3.	0
NewsClaims	2796	"Donald Schaffner, a food science specialist, told The Associate Press, ""These pH values for these foods are completely wrong,"" and people can eat these foods if they want, but the best way to prevent getting sick is to stay away from other people."	0
NewsClaims	2797	Our rating: False	0
NewsClaims	2798	The claim that an alkaline diet will help beat the coronavirus is FALSE.	0
NewsClaims	2799	The claim that coronavirus has a pH level of 5.5 to 8.5 cited a study from 1991 about a different coronavirus, not the one that causes COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2800	The post misinterpreted the findings of that study.	0
NewsClaims	2801	There are no confirmed preventive measures or cures for COVID-19.	0

NewsClaims	2806	SPRINGFIELD, Mass.	0
NewsClaims	2807	(WWLP) – The COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	2808	And with that, comes a lot of false information on the internet.	0
NewsClaims	2809	22News has been vigilant in separating fact from fiction when it comes to coronavirus, both nationally and locally.	0
NewsClaims	2810	There are many myths about COVID-19 that have been circulating through social media — here are some of the most common ones, from the World Health Organization.	0
NewsClaims	2811	"The WHO says there is ""no reason to believe cold weather can kill the new coronavirus,"" or other diseases, for that matter."	0
NewsClaims	2812	Myth #2: COVID-19 cannot be transmitted in hotter, more humid climates	0
NewsClaims	2813	Truth: Protective measures, like proper handwashing and social distancing, need to be taken no matter where you live.	0
NewsClaims	2814	Myth #3: Taking a hot bath prevents you from getting COVID-19	0
NewsClaims	2815	Just like the cold weather and hot and humid climate myths, this is not true.	0
NewsClaims	2816	Your body temperature stays relatively stable even when you take an extremely hot bath.	0
NewsClaims	2817	This just leaves you with a risk of a burn.	0
NewsClaims	2818	This prevents viruses on your hands from infecting you when you touch your face.	0
NewsClaims	2819	Truth: As temperatures continue to warm as we dive into spring, mosquitoes will become more common again in Western Massachusetts.	0
NewsClaims	2820	That typically brings a risk of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile Virus, but the increasing population of mosquitoes does not create another channel in which you can get COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2821	This is because the new coronavirus is spread primarily through droplets when someone with the coronavirus sneezes or coughs.	0
NewsClaims	2822	Myth #5: Hand dryers are effective in killing the new coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	2823	Truth: The heat from a hand dryer alone is not enough to kill the new coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	2824	However, in combination with washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, this method is very effective.	0
NewsClaims	2825	You can also dry your hands after using paper towels, or instead use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.	0
NewsClaims	2826	Myth #6: UV lamps kill the new coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	2827	It should especially not be used on hands or your body as it can cause irritation.	0
NewsClaims	2828	UV light has been known to kill the flu virus, however.	0
NewsClaims	2829	Myth #7: Thermal scanners can detect everyone who is infected with coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	2830	Truth: Thermal scanners, like thermometers, can detect people who have a higher-than-normal body temperature due to infection from COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2831	But not everyone who is infected with the coronavirus has a fever yet.	0
NewsClaims	2832	"According to the WHO, ""it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever."""	0
NewsClaims	2833	(WHO)	0
NewsClaims	2834	Spraying alcohol and chlorine all over your body can be harmful if it gets into your eyes or mouth.	0
NewsClaims	2835	The World Health Organization says they both can be used to disinfect surfaces, however.	0
NewsClaims	2836	Myth #9: Getting a pneumonia vaccine protects against COVID-19	0
NewsClaims	2837	Truth: The World Health Organization says there is some evidence that regularly rinsing your nose with saline can help you get over the common cold more quickly.	0
NewsClaims	2838	But this does not apply to COVID-19, and other respiratory infections.	0
NewsClaims	2839	The same applies to gargling a saline solution.	0
NewsClaims	2840	Truth: There is no scientific evidence that eating garlic prevents you from being infected with the novel coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	2841	However, according to the National Institutes of Health, it does have some antimicrobial properties.	0
NewsClaims	2842	Myth #12: The coronavirus only affects older people, and not younger people	0
NewsClaims	2843	However, people who are older are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the new coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	2844	People with preexisting conditions are also at an increased risk for more severe complications, such as people with heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease.	0
NewsClaims	2845	Truth: The World Health Organization is helping with research and development efforts to find treatments for coronavirus, however, they are still under investigation, and must be tested through clinical trials.	0
NewsClaims	2846	Right now, there is no medication recommended to prevent or treat COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2847	New coronavirus threat galvanizes scientists	0
NewsClaims	2848	Barely 1 month after Chinese health authorities reported the first cases of a mysterious new pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, the world may be on the cusp of a new pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	2849	As	0
NewsClaims	2850	Science	0
NewsClaims	2851	went to press, the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, had shot up to more than 4500, most of them in mainland China but more than 80 in 17 other countries and territories.	0
NewsClaims	2852	China has quarantined 35 million people in Wuhan and several other cities in a desperate attempt to slow the spread of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	2853	But as the case numbers keep soaring, the realization has set in that it may be too late to have much impact.	0
NewsClaims	2854	Even seasoned epidemiologists are astonished at the virus's dizzying spread.	0
NewsClaims	2855	Early estimates of the number of infected people—thought to far exceed the number of confirmed cases—became obsolete overnight.	0
NewsClaims	2856	"""Our original results are NO LONGER VALID,"" University of Hong Kong epidemiologist Gabriel Leung tweeted on 22 January, 1 day after his group had posted its first mathematical model of the epidemic."	0
NewsClaims	2857	Leung is now estimating that Wuhan alone had 43,590 infections by 25 January—and that the number is doubling every 6 days.	0
NewsClaims	2858	"""How widespread does this go?"""	0
NewsClaims	2859	asks Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus Medical Center.	0
NewsClaims	2860	"""This deserves our full attention."""	0

NewsClaims	2865	So far 2019-nCoV appears to be milder than its cousin, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had a mortality rate of 10%.	0
NewsClaims	2866	Only 106 deaths have been recorded to date.	0
NewsClaims	2867	But hundreds more people are seriously ill, and their fate is unclear.	0
NewsClaims	2868	And countless other questions remain.	0
NewsClaims	2869	If asymptomatic people frequently infect others, it could vastly complicate efforts to contain 2019-nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	2870	The virus's explosive spread has been met by an unprecedented rush by scientists to uncover its origins, find treatments, and develop vaccines that could save millions of lives if the world really does face a pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	2871	Here are some of the ways researchers are attempting to better understand 2019-nCoV and reduce its harm.	0
NewsClaims	2872	Where Did the Virus Come From?	0
NewsClaims	2873	Genetic analyses are starting to yield some clues.	0
NewsClaims	2874	Chinese researchers first shared a genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV on 11 January.	0
NewsClaims	2875	"Labs in China and abroad have since announced nearly three dozen additional sequences of the virus—""a stellar job,"" Koopmans says."	0
NewsClaims	2876	A team led by Shi Zheng-Li of the Wuhan Institute of Virology reported on 23 January that 2019-nCoV's sequence was 96.2% identical to that of a bat coronavirus and 79.5% identical to the SARS coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	2877	SARS, for example, probably moved from bats to civets—sold as a delicacy in many markets—to humans.	0
NewsClaims	2878	On 27 January, Xinhua reported that researchers have found evidence of the new coronavirus in 33 of 585 environmental samples taken at the market on 1 January—the day it was closed—and on 12 January.	0
NewsClaims	2879	They all came from the western end, which had a concentration of booths selling wildlife.	0
NewsClaims	2880	The first known patient became ill on 1 December 2019 and had no links to the market, according to a paper published by Chinese researchers in	0
NewsClaims	2881	The Lancet	0
NewsClaims	2882	on 24 January that offered details about the first 41 patients in Wuhan.	0
NewsClaims	2883	In that group, 12 others also had no links to the market.	0
NewsClaims	2884	An analysis of the first 30 publicly posted sequences shows they differ from each other by no more than seven nucleotides (see graphic, right).	0
NewsClaims	2885	Using these differences and presumed mutation rates, several groups have calculated that the virus began to spread around mid-November 2019—which supports the thesis that spread may have occurred before any of the cases linked to the market.	0
NewsClaims	2886	One group put the origin of the outbreak as early as 18 September 2019.	0
NewsClaims	2887	Bin Cao, a pulmonary specialist at Capital Medical University in Beijing and the corresponding author of	0
NewsClaims	2888	The Lancet	0
NewsClaims	2889	article, agrees the story is more complicated than many thought.	0
NewsClaims	2890	Science.	0
NewsClaims	2891	Could Existing Drugs Work?	0
NewsClaims	2892	It may take years to develop treatments specifically designed for 2019-nCoV, but researchers hope existing drugs can help.	0
NewsClaims	2893	Wuhan's Jin Yintan Hospital has already launched a randomized, controlled trial of the anti-HIV drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, according to the report in	0
NewsClaims	2894	The Lancet.	0
NewsClaims	2895	"There's a precedent from the SARS outbreak: In a nonrandomized trial published in 2004, researchers saw an ""apparent improved outcome"" from the same two protease inhibitors, combined with a third drug, ribavirin, in SARS patients."	0
NewsClaims	2896	Saudi Arabia is now conducting a trial with the same protease inhibitors, combined with interferon beta-1b, against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a coronavirus distantly related to SARS and 2019-nCoV that is occasionally spread by camels.	0
NewsClaims	2897	But in a recent mouse study by Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, this cocktail had lackluster results against MERS.	0
NewsClaims	2898	Remdesivir combined with interferon slowed viral replication in MERS-infected mice, and their lung function improved.	0
NewsClaims	2899	U.S. biotech Regeneron is trying to identify monoclonal antibodies effective against 2019-nCoV, as it did previously for MERS and Ebola.	0
NewsClaims	2900	"""The idea of using those in combination would have profoundly good prospects."""	0
NewsClaims	2901	Can Vaccines be Developed in Time?	0
NewsClaims	2902	In the stock pandemic movie, scientists develop a vaccine just in time to save the world.	0
NewsClaims	2903	In real life, new vaccines have never been developed fast enough to have a significant impact on an emerging virus.	0
NewsClaims	2904	But in the case of 2019-nCoV, scientists are trying to work at Hollywood speed.	0
NewsClaims	2905	The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a nonprofit formed in 2016 to fund and shepherd the development of new vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, has already given two companies and an academic group a total of $12.5 million to develop 2019-nCoV vaccines.	0
NewsClaims	2906	The efforts began hours after Chinese researchers first published a viral sequence 3 weeks ago.	0
NewsClaims	2907	One is a collaboration between the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and U.S. biotech Moderna, which makes vaccines by converting viral sequences into messenger RNA (mRNA).	0
NewsClaims	2908	(When injected into the body, mRNA causes the body to produce a viral protein, which triggers immune responses.)	0
NewsClaims	2909	Moderna and NIAID have worked on a vaccine against MERS that consists of mRNA coding for a protein on the viral surface called the spike; in theory, all the team needs to do now is swap in the genetic sequence for 2019-nCoV's spike.	0
NewsClaims	2910	CEPI funded a second company, Inovio, to produce vaccines that work in a similar way but are made of DNA.	0
NewsClaims	2911	It, too, has a template for a 2019-nCoV vaccine: another candidate MERS vaccine that relies on the spike protein.	0
NewsClaims	2912	CEPI's third grant went to researchers at the University of Queensland who are developing a vaccine made of viral proteins produced in cell cultures.	0
NewsClaims	2913	Vaccine projects are also underway in mainland China, Hong Kong, Belgium, and Germany.	0
NewsClaims	2914	Once candidate vaccines are available, researchers will test them in animals, then seek approval for phase I human trials.	0
NewsClaims	2915	"""We're building the airplane as we're flying,"" says Inovio CEO Joseph Kim."	0
NewsClaims	2916	NIAID Director Anthony Fauci says the first clinical trial of the Moderna vaccine could start within 3 months.	0
NewsClaims	2917	In the best-case scenario, Barney Graham, who leads the project for NIAID, says the Moderna vaccine could be ready for larger, real-world efficacy tests in humans by summer.	0
NewsClaims	2918	Even if it works, mass-producing it or any other vaccine quickly would present a huge challenge.	0
NewsClaims	2919	With luck, however, the outbreak will fade by summer, and with it the urgency of having a vaccine at the ready.	0
NewsClaims	2920	"""Nobody knows what's going to happen,"" says Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's CEO."	0
NewsClaims	2921	"""We're all hoping we'll never need this vaccine."""	0
NewsClaims	2922	-- Authorization Enables Broader Use of Remdesivir to Treat Hospitalized Patients with Severe COVID-19 Disease in the United States --	0
NewsClaims	2923	-- Based on Patients’ Severity of Disease, Authorization Allows 5-day and 10-day Treatment Durations --	0
NewsClaims	2924	FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational antiviral remdesivir to treat COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2925	The EUA will facilitate broader use of remdesivir to treat hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to remdesivir at additional hospitals across the country.	0
NewsClaims	2926	Allocation of the currently limited available supply of remdesivir will be made based on guiding principles that aim to maximize access for appropriate patients in urgent need of treatment, with direction from and in collaboration with the government.	0
NewsClaims	2927	Remdesivir is authorized for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease.	0
NewsClaims	2928	The optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.	0
NewsClaims	2929	Under the EUA, both 5-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease.	0
NewsClaims	2930	The authorization is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process.	0
NewsClaims	2931	The EUA allows for the distribution and emergency use of remdesivir only for the treatment of COVID-19; remdesivir remains an investigational drug and has not been approved by FDA.	0
NewsClaims	2932	The U.S. government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities most heavily impacted by COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2933	Given the severity of illness of patients appropriate for remdesivir treatment and the limited availability of drug supply, hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority in the distribution of remdesivir.	0
NewsClaims	2934	Gilead is working with the U.S. government on the logistics of remdesivir distribution and will provide more information when the company begins shipping the drug under the EUA.	0
NewsClaims	2935	“We will continue to work with partners across the globe to increase our supply of remdesivir while advancing our ongoing clinical trials to supplement our understanding of the drug’s profile.	0
NewsClaims	2936	We are working to meet the needs of patients, their families and healthcare workers around the world with the greatest sense of urgency and responsibility.”	0
NewsClaims	2937	The EUA is based on available data from two global clinical trials – the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19, including those who were critically ill, and Gilead’s global Phase 3 study evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in patients with severe disease.	0
NewsClaims	2938	Multiple additional clinical trials are ongoing to generate more data on the safety and efficacy of remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	2939	Remdesivir must be administered intravenously.	0
NewsClaims	2940	The optimal dosing and duration of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 is still unknown.	0
NewsClaims	2941	Under this EUA, the 10-day dosing duration is suggested for patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the 5-day dosing duration is suggested for patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO.	0
NewsClaims	2942	If a patient on the 5-day dosing duration does not demonstrate clinical improvement after five days, treatment may be extended for up to five additional days (10 days total).	0
NewsClaims	2943	As previously announced, Gilead has donated the entirety of its existing supply of finished and unfinished product to help address the urgent medical needs posed by this pandemic around the world.	0
NewsClaims	2944	Assuming a 10-day treatment course, Gilead’s donation of 1.5 million individual doses of remdesivir equates to more than 140,000 treatment courses that will be provided at no cost to treat patients following potential emergency authorizations and regulatory approvals, including this EUA.	0
NewsClaims	2945	Gilead will continue to support clinical trials, and expanded access and compassionate use programs for remdesivir.	0
NewsClaims	2946	In addition, Gilead will evaluate global allocation of supply on an ongoing basis using multiple, independent data sources to track the incidence and severity of the outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	2947	An EUA is intended to provide availability of a medicine during an emergency; an EUA is not the equivalent of an FDA approval.	0
NewsClaims	2948	See below for important information about remdesivir.	0
NewsClaims	2949	Scale-Up of Remdesivir Supply	0
NewsClaims	2950	Gilead has aggressively implemented a multipronged approach to scale up production and rapidly build supply of the investigational antiviral remdesivir.	0

NewsClaims	3006	"It recommended several fruits and vegetables supposedly ""more alkaline"" or ""above the pH level"" of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the disease."	0
NewsClaims	3007	The information is inaccurate.	0
NewsClaims	3008	"""Viruses themselves do not have pH levels, because they are not water-based solutions,"" a group of health experts convened by international nonprofit organization Meedan stated in their COVID-19 Expert Database website."	0
NewsClaims	3009	According to Oxford University’s	0

NewsClaims	3011	"a solution is considered water-based if its ""medium or main ingredient"" is water."	0
NewsClaims	3012	The pH scale is used to determine if a water-based solution is acidic (pH level of below 7), neutral (pH level of 7), or basic, oftentimes called alkaline (pH level of above 7).	0
NewsClaims	3013	Eating more alkaline food does not affect blood pH but may affect a person’s saliva and urine pH levels, said Meedan’s team of experts.	0
NewsClaims	3014	"However, ""these changes are variable from person to person and will not prevent or cure COVID-19."""	0
NewsClaims	3015	Maria Carmela Taob, a faculty member of the Department of Food Science and Nutrition (DFSN) of the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, shared a similar sentiment.	0
NewsClaims	3016	Taob explained that a food’s designation -- whether acidic, neutral, or alkaline -- is based on the ash it leaves behind after being combusted under laboratory conditions.	0
NewsClaims	3017	"Meat, fish, poultry, eggs, cheese, and grains produce ""acid-ash,"" while most fruits and vegetables except for prunes, plums, and cranberries generate ""alkaline-ash."""	0
NewsClaims	3018	Coffee, tea, certain sweets, fats, and starches are considered neutral.	0
NewsClaims	3019	The flier, which listed seven fruits, garlic, dandelion, and turmeric tea, assigned wrong pH level to each food, ranging from 7.4 to 22.7.	0
NewsClaims	3020	"In an April 5 FB post, Benelyn Dumelod, an associate professor from UP DFSN, disputed this, saying the maximum pH value of any ""food or nonfood, living or nonliving"" is 14."	0
NewsClaims	3021	Below is a comparison of the foods’ pH values as declared in the flier, against their correct pH values according to several sources including Dumelod.	0
NewsClaims	3022	None were alkaline, or had a pH level between 7.1 and 14.	0
NewsClaims	3023	Both Taob and the experts at Meedan pointed out that a well-balanced diet -- including the consumption of a variety of fruits and vegetables -- can help support one’s immune system.	0
NewsClaims	3024	As far as the World Health Organization (WHO) is concerned, there is still no drug or vaccine proven to cure or prevent one from acquiring COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	3025	Clinical trials, however, are currently being performed in several parts of the world.	0
NewsClaims	3026	"The viral flier, which bore the title ""Goodbye Corona Virus!"	0
NewsClaims	3027	"The symptoms listed in the flier indicating ""if a person has COVID-19"" are also misleading."	0
NewsClaims	3028	"While dry cough and fever are listed by WHO as common symptoms of the disease, sore throat and the loss of the sense of smell and taste are ""less common"" and may affect some patients only."	0
NewsClaims	3029	"Shortness of breath, on the other hand, is developed by ""seriously-ill"" individuals, which is just around one of every five COVID-19 patients, added the WHO’s list of symptoms."	0
NewsClaims	3030	The earliest retrievable online copy of the flier carrying the false claims was uploaded last April 16 on Twitter.	0
NewsClaims	3031	It got over 41,000 retweets and 53,700 likes, and has received comments from netizens pointing out the disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	3032	However, posts bearing the claims about alkalizing foods have been circulating since March in both FB and private messaging application WhatsApp, as shown by fact check articles of Africa Check, the Associated Press, and the Agence France-Presse.	0
NewsClaims	3033	They appear to have twisted the contents of a 1991 study published in the Journal of Virology that looked into coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus type 4 (MHV4), and not the SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	3034	The false flier was published as original content by at least five netizens on FB from June 17 to 22, and continues to be shared this July.	0

NewsClaims	3044	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the most recent strain of virus from the coronavirus family to infect humans.	0
NewsClaims	3045	This family of viruses also includes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).	0
NewsClaims	3046	They are called novel coronaviruses because it’s the first time these specific viruses have jumped from animals to humans.	0
NewsClaims	3047	Coronavirus myths, debunked	0
NewsClaims	3048	Rumors have spread rapidly about many aspects of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	3049	Here’s the truth about these coronavirus myths about where the virus originated, who is at risk, how it’s transmitted, and contamination concerns.	0
NewsClaims	3050	Local health officials in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China reported several cases of pneumonia among a group of people linked to a wholesale market in Wuhan in December 2019.	0
NewsClaims	3051	That was the start of COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	3052	MYTH: Coronavirus only affects older people	0
NewsClaims	3053	While older people may be more at risk of infection because their immune systems may not be as strong as those of younger adults, they’re far from the only group of people at risk, explains Dr.	0
NewsClaims	3054	Patrick J. Kenney, DO, FACOI, who is double-board certified in Internal Medicine and Infectious Disease.	0
NewsClaims	3055	Several groups of people have an increased risk of infection, including those who are immunosuppressed.	0
NewsClaims	3056	MYTH: Recreational drugs cure coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	3057	"Facebook posts have claimed that weed is a cure for coronavirus (False: Cannabis ""Kills Coronavirus,"" 2020)."	0
NewsClaims	3058	Rumors have said the same about cocaine.	0
NewsClaims	3059	One medication, an antiviral drug called Remdesivir, has been shown in certain studies to improve symptoms and shorten hospital stays.	0
NewsClaims	3060	There are also two vaccines that have received emergency use authorization from the FDA – one made by Pfizer and one made by Moderna.	0
NewsClaims	3061	Roll outs have begun nationwide but it may be some time before you can get the vaccine yourself.	0
NewsClaims	3062	MYTH: Spraying chlorine/rubbing alcohol on your body can cure coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	3063	Rubbing or spraying cleaning products—whether that’s chlorine or rubbing alcohol—will not kill viruses already inside your body.	0
NewsClaims	3064	Even worse, doing so may be harmful to your health.	0
NewsClaims	3065	Chlorine may be used to clean surfaces in your home but should be kept away from your body (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	3066	MYTH: Inhaling bleach fumes cures coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	3067	This is similar to the previous myth.	0
NewsClaims	3068	Inhaling bleach fumes is dangerous and will not kill viruses that are already inside you.	0
NewsClaims	3069	Bleach may also be used to clean surfaces in your home but should be kept away from the body (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	3070	Ingesting or inhaling chemicals can be deadly.	0
NewsClaims	3071	MYTH: Ultraviolet light can kill coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	3072	Exposing parts of your body to ultraviolet (UV) light can be dangerous.	0
NewsClaims	3073	The UV radiation may cause skin irritation, so you should not use UV sterilization lamps on your hands or other parts of your skin (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	3074	MYTH: Air dryers can kill coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	3075	It currently isn’t known exactly how temperature affects the virus.	0
NewsClaims	3076	People have wondered the same thing about warm weather as they have about air dryers.	0
NewsClaims	3077	Although some similar viruses such as the common cold spread easier during colder months, the CDC notes that this doesn’t mean you cannot be infected by them during warmer months (2019-nCoV Frequently Asked Questions and Answers, 2020).	0
NewsClaims	3078	The World Health Organization (WHO) says air dryers are not effective at killing the virus, and they advise that you still wash your hands using proper hand hygiene before drying them with an air dryer or paper towels (WHO, n.d.).	0
NewsClaims	3079	A study published in the	0
NewsClaims	3080	New England Journal of Medicine	0
NewsClaims	3081	found that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be detected in aerosols for up to three hours, on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 hours (Doremalen, 2020).	0
NewsClaims	3082	However, we don’t know how a warmer temperature would affect that timeline.	0
NewsClaims	3083	But there are common household cleaners that can inactivate the virus, and washing your hands following proper protocol can decrease your risk of infection.	0
NewsClaims	3084	MYTH: Antibiotics are effective at treating coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	3085	"""Antibiotics do not treat viruses of any kind, including coronaviruses,"" Dr. Kenney states unequivocally."	0
NewsClaims	3086	Antibiotics target bacteria, not viruses.	0
NewsClaims	3087	COVID-19 is caused by a virus.	0
NewsClaims	3088	MYTH: Sesame oil and garlic can prevent transmission of coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	3089	While garlic has been shown to have some antimicrobial properties, neither garlic nor sesame oil will prevent the transmission of this virus.	0
NewsClaims	3090	MYTH: Regularly rinsing your nose with saline can prevent coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	3091	There is no evidence that rinsing your nose with saline can prevent coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	3092	But you can help reduce your risk of catching coronavirus by following proper hand hygiene before touching your mouth, nose, or eyes, all of which have mucosal linings where the virus may enter.	0
NewsClaims	3093	Surfaces in your home can also be cleaned with 70% ethanol (alcohol) cleanser, which can be purchased commercially, or bleach or sodium hypochlorite solutions, all of which inactivate the virus.	0
NewsClaims	3094	MYTH: Drinking liquids will wash the virus into your stomach where it will die	0
NewsClaims	3095	While it is always a good idea to stay hydrated, it is definitely still possible to become infected even if you are drinking fluids.	0
NewsClaims	3096	The fluids do not wash all of the virus particles into the stomach.	0
NewsClaims	3097	MYTH: You can diagnose yourself with COVID-19 by holding your breath	0
NewsClaims	3098	There is no evidence to suggest that being able to hold your breath is associated with whether or not you have COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	3099	If you think you might be sick, seek medical attention.	0
NewsClaims	3100	MYTH: It’s not safe to receive a package from China	0
NewsClaims	3101	It is, in fact, safe to accept packages that have been shipped from China.	0
NewsClaims	3102	"The CDC notes that there’s a low risk of infection from products that have been shipped from areas with outbreaks because of the virus’s ""low survivability on surfaces"" (2019-nCoV Frequently Asked Questions, 2020)."	0

NewsClaims	3105	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers not to purchase or drink a product sold online as a medical treatment due to a recent rise in reported health issues.	0
NewsClaims	3106	Since 2010, the FDA has warned consumers about the dangers of Miracle or Master Mineral Solution, Miracle Mineral Supplement, MMS, Chlorine Dioxide (CD) Protocol, Water Purification Solution (WPS) and other similar products.	0
NewsClaims	3107	Miracle Mineral Solution has not been approved by the FDA for any use, but these products continue to be promoted on social media as a remedy for treating autism, cancer, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and flu, among other conditions.	0
NewsClaims	3108	“The FDA’s drug approval process ensures that patients receive safe and effective drug products.	0
NewsClaims	3109	Miracle Mineral Solution and similar products are not FDA-approved, and ingesting these products is the same as drinking bleach.	0
NewsClaims	3110	Consumers should not use these products, and parents should not give these products to their children for any reason,” said FDA Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless, M.D.	0
NewsClaims	3111	“The FDA will continue to track those selling this dangerous product and take appropriate enforcement actions against those who attempt to evade FDA regulations and market unapproved and potentially dangerous products to the American public.	0
NewsClaims	3112	Our top priority is to protect the public from products that place their health at risk, and we will send a strong and clear message that these products have the potential to cause serious harm.”	0
NewsClaims	3113	Websites selling MMS describe the product as a liquid that is 28% sodium chlorite in distilled water.	0
NewsClaims	3114	Product directions instruct consumers to mix the sodium chlorite solution with citric acid – such as lemon or lime juice – or another acid before drinking.	0
NewsClaims	3115	In many instances, the sodium chlorite is sold with a citric acid “activator.” When the acid is added, the mixture becomes chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleaching agent.	0
NewsClaims	3116	The FDA recently received new reports of people experiencing severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, life-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration and acute liver failure after drinking these products.	0
NewsClaims	3117	The FDA is not aware of any scientific evidence supporting the safety or effectiveness of MMS products, despite claims that the solution is an antimicrobial, antiviral and antibacterial.	0
NewsClaims	3118	The FDA encourages consumers to talk to a health care professional about treating medical conditions or diseases.	0
NewsClaims	3119	Consumers who have experienced an adverse health effect after ingesting this product should seek immediate medical attention.	0
NewsClaims	3120	Anyone who has experienced an adverse health effect that may be related to MMS should report it through the FDA’s MedWatch Safety Information program as soon as possible at 800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm.	0
NewsClaims	3121	The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.	0
NewsClaims	3122	The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.	0

NewsClaims	3165	The research report referred to in the Journal of Virology & Anti viral Research is related to a completely different coronavirus - Mouse Hepatitis Virus Type-4 or MHV-4 & not COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	3166	The report was published way back in 1991.	0
NewsClaims	3167	People are desperate for hope during the coronavirus outbreak, and online claims touting this diet are going viral.	0

NewsClaims	3265	4 COVID-19 myths	0
NewsClaims	3266	Last updated Oct.	0
NewsClaims	3267	13, 2020	0
NewsClaims	3268	Have you heard the one about how the coronavirus (COVID-19) isn’t nearly as bad as catching the flu?	0
NewsClaims	3269	"How about the claim that only ""old people"" need to worry about COVID-19?"	0
NewsClaims	3270	after	0
NewsClaims	3271	you’ve been infected?	0
NewsClaims	3272	None of these things are true.	0
NewsClaims	3273	But myths like these can gain a lot of traction because people read or hear about them and then repeat them to friends and family.	0
NewsClaims	3274	"That’s why it’s important to separate fact from fiction before hitting the ""share"" button."	0
NewsClaims	3275	"""Besides practicing social distancing and regular handwashing, sharing accurate information is one of the best things we can do to help slow the spread of COVID-19,"" says infectious diseases and infection control specialist Roy Chemaly, M.D."	0
NewsClaims	3276	To set the record straight, here’s what he wants you to know about some of the most common myths related to COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	3277	"Myth #1: COVID-19 only affects ""old people,"" so I’m not at risk."	0
NewsClaims	3278	Fact: The COVID-19 pandemic concerns everyone, because people of any age can be infected with the virus that causes it.	0
NewsClaims	3279	And while most cases of COVID-19 are mild, the elderly and people with chronic health conditions, such as cancer, are even more vulnerable.	0
NewsClaims	3280	Children appear to be both less susceptible to infection by the virus and less likely to develop COVID-19 as a result.	0
NewsClaims	3281	"Still, says Chemaly, ""It’s important to remember that healthy people in their 30s and 40s have developed severe COVID-19 symptoms, and some people with chronic health conditions in their 70s and 80s have not."	0
NewsClaims	3282	"So, no one is risk-free."""	0
NewsClaims	3283	Fact: Bacteria that causes food-borne illness can be destroyed by exposing it to high temperatures during the cooking process.	0
NewsClaims	3284	The same can be said of some other microorganisms, too.	0
NewsClaims	3285	If you actually	0
NewsClaims	3286	have	0
NewsClaims	3287	the coronavirus, though, the best thing you can do is stay at home.	0
NewsClaims	3288	Take care of yourself there until the infection has run its course, or until your symptoms become severe enough that you need to seek medical attention.	0
NewsClaims	3289	"""There is no existing treatment right now that can actually kill the virus,"" says Chemaly."	0
NewsClaims	3290	"""At this point, we can only treat the symptoms."	0
NewsClaims	3291	Myth #3: COVID-19 is not as bad as the flu.	0
NewsClaims	3292	Fact: COVID-19 is different from the flu in several important ways.	0
NewsClaims	3293	First, the 2019 novel coronavirus appears to be more contagious.	0
NewsClaims	3294	Second, symptoms of the flu tend to come on suddenly, then get worse within a day or two.	0
NewsClaims	3295	Symptoms of COVID-19 can be mild and much more gradual, building up over several days or even weeks.	0
NewsClaims	3296	Third, while most flu-related deaths are caused by secondary infections (such as pneumonia) or other complications, most deaths stemming from COVID-19 are caused by the body’s immune response to the virus itself.	0
NewsClaims	3297	"""The severe respiratory distress syndrome that some people develop as a result of infection makes it hard for them to breathe,"" explains Chemaly."	0
NewsClaims	3298	"""Finally, because we haven’t encountered this particular coronavirus before as a species, we have no vaccine, no effective anti-viral treatment, and no immunity, whereas we have all three of those for the flu,"" Chemaly says."	0
NewsClaims	3299	Myth #4: Social distancing doesn’t apply to me.	0
NewsClaims	3300	"Fact: This myth has multiple variations: everything from, ""I don’t have any symptoms, so I can still go out,"" to ""my local or state government hasn’t put a stay-at-home order in place, so I don’t need to do it"" to ""there aren’t that many coronavirus cases in my area, so I don’t need to worry"" – or even ""I’ve been pretty good about staying home, so it’s OK if I make an exception and go out this time."""	0
NewsClaims	3301	But they’re all untrue.	0
NewsClaims	3302	According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some people infected with the coronavirus may not show any symptoms.	0
NewsClaims	3303	That means they might not even know they have COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	3304	"""And just because someone doesn’t"	0
NewsClaims	3305	know	0
NewsClaims	3306	"they have the coronavirus, doesn’t mean they’re not contagious,"" says Chemaly."	0
NewsClaims	3307	"That’s also why no city, part of town or neighborhood can be considered ""safe,"" even if few confirmed cases have been reported there yet."	0
NewsClaims	3308	"""Don’t underestimate your personal risk for coronavirus — or put others at risk — based on a false claim,"" says Chemaly."	0

NewsClaims	3339	(CNN) As the novel coronavirus -- and panic about the coronavirus -- continues to spread around the world, so too are bogus claims, conspiracy theories and misinformation about the disease.	0
NewsClaims	3340	"There's so much inaccurate information floating around out there that the World Health Organization is calling it an ""infodemic."""	0
NewsClaims	3341	In perhaps the clearest sign of the times, WHO has joined TikTok to help set the record straight.	0
NewsClaims	3342	The myths exist both on the fringes of the internet and in more mainstream outlets.	0
NewsClaims	3343	And while social media platforms are now taking steps to elevate credible information and remove content that could confuse people, they're fighting an uphill battle.	0
NewsClaims	3344	Meanwhile, censorship and government mistrust in some countries have created a petri dish for misinformation to spread.	0
NewsClaims	3345	Here's the truth about the new coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	3346	Reality: Don't believe everything you read on the internet.	0
NewsClaims	3347	The rumors, which originated from unverified social media accounts and weren't supported by any credible evidence, got more elaborate as time went on.	0
NewsClaims	3348	Another that gained traction among nationalistic parts of the Chinese social mediasphere suggested that the virus originated in the US -- and that many Americans thought to have died of the flu this season were actually killed by COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	3349	Scientists in both China and the West have widely dismissed these theories, though that hasn't stopped them from spreading.	0
NewsClaims	3350	Experts are still trying to figure out the exact source of the virus, but research indicates that it likely originated in bats and was transmitted to an intermediate host before jumping to people -- just like its cousin that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic.	0
NewsClaims	3351	Reality: Garlic is good for you.	0
NewsClaims	3352	So is water.	0
NewsClaims	3353	And vitamin C. But despite what some corners of social media would have you believe, there's Garlic is good for you.	0
NewsClaims	3354	So is water.	0
NewsClaims	3355	But if the virus is already in your body, putting those substances on your skin or under your nose won't kill it -- and can actually be dangerous.	0
NewsClaims	3356	And this should go without saying, but please, please, do not ingest chemical disinfectants either.	0
NewsClaims	3357	There's currently no cure for the novel coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	3358	And while research is underway, it could be more than a year before a vaccine becomes available.	0
NewsClaims	3359	The best way to protect yourself right now is to do what you would every cold and flu season.	0
NewsClaims	3360	Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze with your elbow or a tissue that you throw away immediately after.	0
NewsClaims	3361	And disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch.	0
NewsClaims	3362	If you have symptoms that feel worse than a common cold, seek treatment early.	0
NewsClaims	3363	Myth: Black people don't get coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	3364	Reality: Anyone can get coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	3365	Any person who comes into close contact with someone who is infected is at risk for contracting the virus, according to the CDC.	0
NewsClaims	3366	Take it from Dr. Jennifer Caudle, an African American family medicine physician and on-air health expert who has also been debunking coronavirus myths .	0
NewsClaims	3367	Caudle said she worries that some people may not take proper precautions to protect themselves against the virus because they may have heard this myth.	0
NewsClaims	3368	"""Black people can get coronavirus, just like other people,"" she told CNN."	0
NewsClaims	3369	Look no further than Africa, where the pandemic is gaining a foothold.	0
NewsClaims	3370	So far, the virus hasn't spread in Africa as quickly as it has on some other continents.	0
NewsClaims	3371	But numbers there are rising fast	0
NewsClaims	3372	Ten African nations have reported nearly 100 coronavirus cases.	0
NewsClaims	3373	Egypt has been the worst hit with at least 59 cases -- more than half of all confirmed cases on the continent.	0
NewsClaims	3374	Reality: This one's a little trickier, and varies from country to country.	0
NewsClaims	3375	Given the shortage of masks in the US and the resulting price-gouging , US officials have warned the public not to hoard masks, particularly N95 respirators, so that they remain available to those most at risk.	0
NewsClaims	3376	Those who should wear masks are people who already have the new coronavirus and could potentially infect others, those caring for an infected patient in close settings and health care workers.	0
NewsClaims	3377	Outside the US, the guidance around face masks is different.	0
NewsClaims	3378	Authorities across Asia, which has now been dealing with the virus for months, have urged that people wear surgical masks particularly on public transportation or in other crowded places to prevent transmission of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	3379	However, Hong Kong's health authority does say that N95 respirators are generally not recommended for use by the general public, given that wearing and removing it properly requires special training.	0
NewsClaims	3380	To determine whether you need to wear a mask or not, it's best to check the latest guidance issues by your country's health authorities.	0
NewsClaims	3381	The organization also says that UV lamps shouldn't be used to sterilize hands or other areas of the body because the radiation can irritate skin.	0
NewsClaims	3382	President Donald Trump has previously suggested that heat kills the virus and that because of this, the current outbreak will have dissipated by spring.	0
NewsClaims	3383	Reality: Feel free to check your mail.	0
NewsClaims	3384	Researchers are still studying exactly how the new coronavirus infects people, but judging by previous coronaviruses, it doesn't stay alive for long on objects and surfaces.	0
NewsClaims	3385	Myth: Kids can't get the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	3386	Reality: Anyone of any age can get the new coronavirus, though older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to serious infections.	0
NewsClaims	3387	While most confirmed cases of the virus have occurred in adults, children have been infected too, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	0
NewsClaims	3388	Myth: People who get the coronavirus will die	0
NewsClaims	3389	Reality: Officials Officials estimate the death rate for the virus to be around 3% to 4% globally, based on the information they have, though they expect that number to fall.	0
NewsClaims	3390	People who get coronavirus will typically get sick with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold.	0
NewsClaims	3391	Symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache and a fever that can last for a couple of days.	0
NewsClaims	3392	Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own.	0
NewsClaims	3393	The disease can be fatal but those cases are rarer.	0
NewsClaims	3394	For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like pneumonia or bronchitis.	0
NewsClaims	3395	Given that thousands of people have been infected and authorities are still struggling to contain the virus, though, even a 3% to 4% mortality rate is worrisome.	0
NewsClaims	3396	CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to reflect the varied guidance around face masks in countries outside the US.	0
NewsClaims	3397	A clinical hold on a potential treatment for COVID-19 is becoming political.	0
NewsClaims	3398	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a hold on the Emergency Use Authorization for convalescent plasma as a potential treatment for COVID-19 over what was described as a lack of robust data supporting its use.	0
NewsClaims	3399	"""The three of us are pretty aligned on the importance of robust data through randomized control trials, and that a pandemic does not change that,"" Lane told the Times, as reported by CNN."	0
NewsClaims	3400	Convalescent plasma is collected from patients who have recovered from a virus such as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	3401	The idea is that the plasma, which contains antibodies against the virus, will be administered into patients who are critically ill.	0
NewsClaims	3402	That pathway is still available for physicians to use should they deem it necessary, but the granting of a broader EUA is still up for debate – and that is not sitting well with President Donald Trump.	0
NewsClaims	3403	During a press briefing Wednesday, Trump questioned whether or not the decision to withhold EUA was political, rather than clinical.	0
NewsClaims	3404	“I hear great things about it ... that’s all I can tell you,” Trump said, according to CNBC.	0
NewsClaims	3405	“It could be a political decision because you have a lot of people over there who don’t want to rush things because they want to do it after Nov. 3, and you’ve heard that one before.”	0
NewsClaims	3406	Trump added that he heard convalescent plasma was “good” from “people at the FDA” and said it should be approved “if it’s good.” He stated that success rates from the use of convalescent plasma are “way over” 50% and urged approval of the plasma treatment.	0
NewsClaims	3407	That guideline could change as there are multiple convalescent plasma clinical studies being conducted across the globe.	0

NewsClaims	3410	The state of New York, which was the U.S. epicenter for COVID-19 in the spring, initiated a clinical trial to study the efficacy of the blood-based treatment.	0
NewsClaims	3411	This week, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded Plasma Technologies a $750,000 contract to scale up convalescent plasma as a potential COVID-19 treatment.	0

NewsClaims	3416	Health authorities found virus strains in humans and in mink which showed decreased sensitivity against antibodies, potentially lowering the efficacy of future vaccines, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said.	0
NewsClaims	3417	"""We have a great responsibility towards our own population, but with the mutation that has now been found, we have an even greater responsibility for the rest of the world as well,"" Frederiksen told a news conference."	0
NewsClaims	3418	The findings, which have been shared with the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, were based on laboratory tests by the State Serum Institute, the Danish authority dealing with infectious diseases.	0
NewsClaims	3419	"""The Danish authorities are investigating the epidemiological and virological significance of these findings."""	0
NewsClaims	3420	Authorities in Denmark said five cases of the new virus strain had been recorded on mink farms and 12 cases in humans, and that there were between 15 million and 17 million mink in the country.	0
NewsClaims	3421	Outbreaks at mink farms have persisted in the Nordic country, the world’s largest producer of mink furs, despite repeated efforts to cull infected animals since June.	0
NewsClaims	3422	Denmark’s police, army and home guard will be deployed to speed up the culling process, Frederiksen said.	0
NewsClaims	3423	Christian Sonne, professor of Veterinary and Wildlife Medicine at Aarhus University, said in an email he believed culling the herd now as a precautionary measure was a sound decision and could prevent a future outbreak that would be more difficult to control.	0
NewsClaims	3424	Sonne co-authored a letter published in the journal Science last week calling for the cull.	0
NewsClaims	3425	"""China, Denmark, and Poland should support and extend the immediate and complete ban of mink production,"" Sonne and his co-authors wrote last week."	0
NewsClaims	3426	Tougher lockdown restrictions and intensified tracing efforts will be implemented to contain the virus in some areas of Northern Denmark, home to a large number of mink farms, authorities said.	0

NewsClaims	3432	As Science went to press, the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, had shot up to more than 4500, most of them in mainland China but more than 80 in 17 other countries and territories.	0
NewsClaims	3433	China has quarantined 35 million people in Wuhan and several other cities in a desperate attempt to slow the spread of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	3434	But as the case numbers keep soaring, the realization has set in that it may be too late to have much impact.	0
NewsClaims	3435	Even seasoned epidemiologists are astonished at the virus's dizzying spread.	0
NewsClaims	3436	Early estimates of the number of infected people—thought to far exceed the number of confirmed cases—became obsolete overnight.	0
NewsClaims	3437	“Our original results are NO LONGER VALID,” University of Hong Kong epidemiologist Gabriel Leung tweeted on 22 January, 1 day after his group had posted its first mathematical model of the epidemic.	0
NewsClaims	3438	Leung is now estimating that Wuhan alone had 43,590 infections by 25 January—and that the number is doubling every 6 days.	0
NewsClaims	3439	“How widespread does this go?” asks Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus Medical Center.	0
NewsClaims	3440	“This deserves our full attention.”	0
NewsClaims	3441	Early this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) had not yet declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the loudest alarm the agency can sound.	0
NewsClaims	3442	In meetings on 22 and 23 January, a special WHO committee that includes Koopmans was divided on whether a PHEIC was warranted, in part because there was no evidence the disease was spreading between people outside of China.	0
NewsClaims	3443	But by 28 January, several countries had reported local human-to-human transmission, which may change the equation.	0
NewsClaims	3444	So far 2019-nCoV appears to be milder than its cousin, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which had a mortality rate of 10%.	0
NewsClaims	3445	Only 106 deaths have been recorded to date.	0
NewsClaims	3446	But hundreds more people are seriously ill, and their fate is unclear.	0
NewsClaims	3447	And countless other questions remain.	0
NewsClaims	3448	Scientists don't know how long the incubation period lasts or whether infected people who show no symptoms can transmit the virus.	0
NewsClaims	3449	China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported on 26 January that a seemingly healthy man appeared to have infected “a few colleagues.” If asymptomatic people frequently infect others, it could vastly complicate efforts to contain 2019-nCoV.	0
NewsClaims	3450	The virus's explosive spread has been met by an unprecedented rush by scientists to uncover its origins, find treatments, and develop vaccines that could save millions of lives if the world really does face a pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	3451	Here are some of the ways researchers are attempting to better understand 2019-nCoV and reduce its harm.	0
NewsClaims	3452	Where Did the Virus Come From?	0
NewsClaims	3453	Almost certainly from animals, but when and how are mysteries.	0
NewsClaims	3454	Genetic analyses are starting to yield some clues.	0
NewsClaims	3455	Chinese researchers first shared a genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV on 11 January.	0
NewsClaims	3456	Labs in China and abroad have since announced nearly three dozen additional sequences of the virus—“a stellar job,” Koopmans says.	0
NewsClaims	3457	That doesn't mean 2019-nCoV jumped directly from bats to humans, says evolutionary biologist Kristian Andersen of Scripps Research.	0
NewsClaims	3458	SARS, for example, probably moved from bats to civets—sold as a delicacy in many markets—to humans.	0
NewsClaims	3459	On 27 January, Xinhua reported that researchers have found evidence of the new coronavirus in 33 of 585 environmental samples taken at the market on 1 January—the day it was closed—and on 12 January.	0
NewsClaims	3460	They all came from the western end, which had a concentration of booths selling wildlife.	0
NewsClaims	3461	That indicates the market played a role in spreading the virus, says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University—but he says other data suggest it wasn't the origin.	0
NewsClaims	3462	In that group, 12 others also had no links to the market.	0
NewsClaims	3463	Lucey contends the virus was already circulating silently among humans before it contaminated the seafood market, possibly by infected animals, humans, or both.	0
NewsClaims	3464	CREDITS: (GRAPHIC) C. BICKEL/SCIENCE; (DATA) TREVOR BEDFORD/NEXTSTRAIN.ORG The genomic data cannot pinpoint the origin, but they do show that the jump from animals to humans happened recently, Koopmans says.	0
NewsClaims	3465	An analysis of the first 30 publicly posted sequences shows they differ from each other by no more than seven nucleotides (see graphic, right).	0
NewsClaims	3466	Bin Cao, a pulmonary specialist at Capital Medical University in Beijing and the corresponding author of The Lancet article, agrees the story is more complicated than many thought.	0
NewsClaims	3467	“But to be honest, we still do not know where the virus came from now.”	0
NewsClaims	3468	Could Existing Drugs Work?	0
NewsClaims	3469	It may take years to develop treatments specifically designed for 2019-nCoV, but researchers hope existing drugs can help.	0
NewsClaims	3470	Wuhan's Jin Yintan Hospital has already launched a randomized, controlled trial of the anti-HIV drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, according to the report in The Lancet.	0
NewsClaims	3471	There's a precedent from the SARS outbreak: In a nonrandomized trial published in 2004, researchers saw an “apparent improved outcome” from the same two protease inhibitors, combined with a third drug, ribavirin, in SARS patients.	0
NewsClaims	3472	Saudi Arabia is now conducting a trial with the same protease inhibitors, combined with interferon beta-1b, against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), a coronavirus distantly related to SARS and 2019-nCoV that is occasionally spread by camels.	0
NewsClaims	3473	But in a recent mouse study by Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, this cocktail had lackluster results against MERS.	0
NewsClaims	3474	The same study showed better outcomes for remdesivir, an experimental drug made by Gilead and previously tested against Ebola that interferes with the viral polymerase enzyme.	0
NewsClaims	3475	Remdesivir combined with interferon slowed viral replication in MERS-infected mice, and their lung function improved.	0
NewsClaims	3476	“Remdesivir has had activity against every coronavirus we've tested, and I'd be surprised if it didn't have activity against” 2019-nCoV, says co-author Mark Denison, a virologist at Vanderbilt University.	0
NewsClaims	3477	Development of entirely new treatments has started as well.	0
NewsClaims	3478	The ideal treatment for 2019-nCoV may well be a drug like remdesivir plus monoclonal antibodies, Denison says.	0
NewsClaims	3479	“The idea of using those in combination would have profoundly good prospects.”	0

NewsClaims	3482	The Federal Emergency Management Agency is trying to knock down a series of rumors and falsehoods that have been spreading along with the coronavirus pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	3483	"It launched a page on its website called Coronavirus Rumor Control to fight the misinformation as officials work to assure the public there is, in fact, no ""national quarantine,"" nor has FEMA deployed ""military assets."""	0
NewsClaims	3484	"""No, FEMA does not have military assets,"" the site notes."	0
NewsClaims	3485	"Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf told Fox News on Saturday that ""we have no plans for a national lockdown or a national quarantine,"" calling that disinformation."	0

NewsClaims	3490	First casualty of war	0
NewsClaims	3491	In a sense, it's not surprising that bad information spreads during a crisis, says Gary Webb, chair of the Department of Emergency Management and Disaster Science at the University of North Texas.	0
NewsClaims	3492	"""People are just seeking out information, where we're kind of searching for answers and trying to kind of muddle our way through all of this ambiguity and and uncertainty,"" Webb tells NPR."	0

NewsClaims	3494	"And not all of that is going to be credible and accurate information."""	0
NewsClaims	3495	Part of the blame for the ease with which rumors and bad information spreads is due to social media, Webb says.	0
NewsClaims	3496	"""So many people rely on it to communicate with friends and family members."	0
NewsClaims	3497	"And it's for many people a primary source of information,"" he says."	0
NewsClaims	3498	"""But at the same time, we know that social media can also be bombarded with inaccurate information."""	0
NewsClaims	3499	Swimming with the sharks	0
NewsClaims	3500	Some of the misinformation that spreads in times of crisis is less than harmful.	0
NewsClaims	3501	There were rumors claiming sharks were swimming in the streets during Hurricane Florence — perhaps the inspiration for recent false claims that dolphins were spotted frolicking in the canals of Venice because the water was now clean due to a coronavirus-related lack of boat traffic.	0
NewsClaims	3502	It's not clear where much of this material originates, although Trump administration officials have blamed foreign governments.	0
NewsClaims	3503	"""What we know — whether it's Russia, or whether it's other cyber actors... [is] they like to sow discord on any controversial issue,"" Wolf said on another Fox show."	0
NewsClaims	3504	"""So, it doesn't just have to be elections."	0
NewsClaims	3505	It can be any issue.	0
NewsClaims	3506	"And we're seeing that now with the coronavirus."""	0
NewsClaims	3507	Trump himself was angered that a spokesman for China's foreign ministry falsely alleged that the U.S. Army had introduced the coronavirus to Wuhan, its original epicenter in China.	0
NewsClaims	3508	"Webb isn't convinced much of misinformation that spreads in crises has sinister origins, saying much of it ""stems from some inconsistent messaging that's coming out about the virus."	0
NewsClaims	3509	"And I think that inconsistency is really happening at all levels."""	0
NewsClaims	3510	"FEMA, he says, is ""trying to reduce some of those inconsistencies and also reduce some of the confusion and ambiguity"" with its website."	0
NewsClaims	3511	Hucksters and flimflam	0
NewsClaims	3512	A related problem: In a crisis there are always those who try to illegally cash in.	0
NewsClaims	3513	Another myth that FEMA is rebuking holds that the government is currently mailing out $1,000 checks to Americans.	0
NewsClaims	3514	Although members of Congress are debating relief legislation, the particulars aren't yet final.	0
NewsClaims	3515	"FEMA says: ""The U.S. government is not mailing checks in response to COVID-19 at this time."	0
NewsClaims	3516	"Anyone who tells you they can get you the money now is a scammer."""	0
NewsClaims	3517	Attorney General William Barr vowed at the White House on Monday that the Justice Department would crack down on coronavirus scammers.	0
NewsClaims	3518	That followed action by the department to shut down a website that was offering what it called a vaccine kit — a fraud.	0
NewsClaims	3519	The Justice Department alleged that the operators of the website were running a wire fraud scheme to profit off of the fear around the COVID-19 pandemic.	0

NewsClaims	3544	Greg Rubini declares that Dr.	0
NewsClaims	3545	Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was involved in the emergence of the coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	3546	A biological weapon?	0
NewsClaims	3547	"The retrovirus (RNA-containing viruses, which includes HIV) belongs to the same genome ""class"" as drosophiles, white mice, Escherichia coli and its plasmid/ring genome, which is convenient for rapid laboratory reproduction of modified genetic engineering."	0
NewsClaims	3548	To imagine that a world pandemic has arisen as a result of mutations in drosophila or white mice is as ridiculous as to claim the same thing about retrovirus.	0
NewsClaims	3549	There are a variety of relevant factors: the warm winter and coming cool summer,the outbreak occurring in Wuhan where bioweapon labs are located, the US extensive research modifying retro-viruses in bats to be embedded in the human genome, the current level of bio-science– With all of this in mind, the artificial origin of the current coronavirus seems probable.	0
NewsClaims	3550	According to UWI sources in the medical industry engaged in the study of COVID-19, the specific features of the novel coronavirus (rapid mutation, gradual weakening, etc.)	0
NewsClaims	3551	show that it is synthetic, made in the laboratory.	0
NewsClaims	3552	Survivors have problems with the lungs (fibrosis), and the genome has the potential to develop into cancer.	0
NewsClaims	3553	Thus the real danger for the survivors will come in future.	0
NewsClaims	3554	In theory, the new coronavirus is quite suitable as a biological weapon.	0
NewsClaims	3555	The virus is respiratory, meaning it spreads effectively.	0
NewsClaims	3556	It has a long incubation period.	0
NewsClaims	3557	The coronavirus takes control of the first stages of the infection.	0
NewsClaims	3558	It can suppress the immune response in the first stages.	0
NewsClaims	3559	When the number of copies exceeds a certain level, an immunity is triggered, but already as a systemic immune response.	0
NewsClaims	3560	This response is so strong that it leads to lung damage.	0
NewsClaims	3561	The immune system gives such a strong answer that in lungs is formed edema, their vital volume is reduced to a minimum, making it impossible for the victim to breathe.	0
NewsClaims	3562	"For example, both American and Chinese researchers criticized an Indian paper which claimed that four unique inserts in COVID-19, all of which are similar to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1, are ""unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,"" suggesting that the virus might have been designed."	0
NewsClaims	3563	Or perhaps these scientists have something they want to conceal?	0
NewsClaims	3564	A dangerous experiment	0
NewsClaims	3565	In 2015, Professor Ralph Baric, the head of the Department of Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, made a chimera coronavirus and published an article showing its potential danger.	0
NewsClaims	3566	Nature magazine reported on the experiment.	0
NewsClaims	3567	The researchers had experimented with the creation of a hybrid coronavirus by crossing the surface protein SHC014 with the SARS virus in bats.	0
NewsClaims	3568	The result was a mutant virus that develops very quickly and actively in human cells, and is extremely deadly.	0
NewsClaims	3569	The discovery sparked a heated debate in the scientific community.	0
NewsClaims	3570	Scientists at the time said a deadly virus could leak out of the lab, taking a lot of lives.	0
NewsClaims	3571	The fact that the experiment was conducted after US authorities imposed a moratorium on funding research on influenza viruses such as SARS and MERS in 2014 has also sparked criticism, as an exception seems to have been made in this case.	0
NewsClaims	3572	"""The only impact of this work is the creation, in a lab, of a new, non-natural risk"", said Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and biodefense expert at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey."	0
NewsClaims	3573	So we have scientific research that has proven the possibility of creating a deadly virus based on coronavirus found in Chinese bats.	0
NewsClaims	3574	The research was conducted in the US, and although this kind of research was prohibited, the government made an exception for it.	0
NewsClaims	3575	In 4 years, the US ran simulations where the virus emerged in China and led to the death of half a million people in the US itself.	0
NewsClaims	3576	During the exercise, there were reports of a possible diversion of biological weapons from a military laboratory in Fort Detrick.	0
NewsClaims	3577	A few months later, China is experiencing an outbreak of disease caused by the mutated coronavirus of bats.	0
NewsClaims	3578	Is it likely that this is just a simple coincidence?	0
NewsClaims	3579	The elites were prepared	0
NewsClaims	3580	With the coronavirus epidemic worsening in the US and around the world, the markets continue to fall.	0

NewsClaims	3585	The husband of Senator Loeffler – Jeffrey Sprecher – is a chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.	0
NewsClaims	3586	Back in 2015, multibillionaire Bill Gates warned about the possibility of a global epidemic and said that countries are not ready for it.	0
NewsClaims	3587	In his speech, Bill Gates pointed out that a global disaster would not look like a nuclear war, it would take the form of a pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	3588	At the end of 2018, Bill Gates again expressed his fears about the new epidemic and even named its source – China.	0
NewsClaims	3589	The billionaire also suggested that the Chinese virus would kill about 33 million people.	0
NewsClaims	3590	Gates is known as a proponent of population reduction.	0
NewsClaims	3591	Earlier, researchers found a link between the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the British Pirbright Institute, which in 2015 filed for a patent for a living coronavirus, which was approved in 2018.	0
NewsClaims	3592	The coronavirus outbreak has drawn a great deal of attention to the dangerous plans of the world’s elites, including funding research into new types of biological weapons under the guise of humanitarianism.	0
NewsClaims	3593	Coronavirus, or rather the hysteria caused by its spread, may become one of the additional factors in a new world financial crisis, during time which the world’s elites will divide up a large portion of the world’s wealth between then.	0
NewsClaims	3594	It should be noted that there is no direct proof that the new coronavirus is an American biological weapon.	0
NewsClaims	3595	The theory that it is a Chinese biological weapon also has no direct evidence.	0
NewsClaims	3596	However, there is circumstantial evidence that indicates that the coronavirus may well have been created in a laboratory environment in the United States.	0
NewsClaims	3597	At the same time, at least in part, the coronavirus plays into the hands of globalist elites.	0
NewsClaims	3598	However, a number of trends, including the closure of economies and borders, may actually end up working against globalism.	0
NewsClaims	3599	As the virus spreads, governments are strengthening their national sovereignty and closing their borders, moving closer to multipolarity.	0

NewsClaims	3676	SARS-CoV-2 Transmission and Children	0
NewsClaims	3677	(Last update 26 March 2021)	0
NewsClaims	3678	Children and adolescents have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 than adults, and children younger than 10-14 years appear to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than older children and adults (20 years and older).	0
NewsClaims	3679	This has been concluded by multiple systematic literature reviews, although heterogeneity in study results has been reported [6,7].	0
NewsClaims	3680	In one of these studies, children (under 20 years of age) had a pooled odds ratio (OR) of being an infected contact of 0.56 (95% CI 0.37-0.85) compared to adults, albeit with substantial study heterogeneity [6].	0
NewsClaims	3681	Further stratification by age showed that the lower susceptibility was limited to those younger than 10-14 years [6].	0
NewsClaims	3682	This finding was also observed for infections by B.1.1.7 variant SARS-CoV-2, which is more transmissible than wild-type SARS-CoV-2 across all age groups [8,9].	0
NewsClaims	3683	There are currently few published studies that have presented data on new variants of concern and their potential transmissibility and disease severity in children, representing a knowledge gap in the field.	0
NewsClaims	3684	Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain the lower infection rates and disease severity observed in children [10].	0
NewsClaims	3685	These include that it could be due to lower case ascertainment as children are more often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.	0
NewsClaims	3686	However, the lower infection rates in children have been observed also in studies where asymptomatic contacts have been tested [11].	0
NewsClaims	3687	In assuming that all household contacts have an equal exposure risk to a given household index case, the authors of one systematic review hypothesised that assessing household contacts could provide a clearer indication of SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibilities.	0
NewsClaims	3688	In looking at household contacts only, the pooled OR for secondary infections among child household contacts versus secondary infections among adult household contacts was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22-0.76) [6].	0
NewsClaims	3689	Another systematic review of household studies found higher secondary attack rates in adult contacts than in child contacts, a difference that held even when all contacts, irrespective of symptoms, were tested [11].	0
NewsClaims	3690	However, these results, as also pointed out by the authors, could not account for the type of household contacts.	0
NewsClaims	3691	Furthermore, household studies have not generally demonstrated an elevated risk of onward transmission from children.	0
NewsClaims	3692	One preprint study of 150 households in Germany found lower secondary attack rates in households where the index cases was younger than 18 years [13].	0
NewsClaims	3693	A large cohort study from Scotland of over 300 000 adults living in households with children found that the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was slightly lower for those living with young children (0-11 years old), and that there was no increased risk for such individuals even during periods when nurseries and primary schools were open [14].	0
NewsClaims	3694	In contrast to findings from household studies, a population-based study conducted in Austria seems to indicate that children of all ages have a roughly equivalent infection risk.	0
NewsClaims	3695	A representative sample of over 10 000 randomly selected staff and students from 243 primary and secondary school were tested regardless of symptoms in three consecutive periods.	0
NewsClaims	3696	For the first three rounds (September 2020, November 2020, and March 2021), there was neither a statistically significant difference between prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among primary school students and middle or lower secondary school students, nor between students and teachers [15].	0
NewsClaims	3697	However, the study found that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in children was substantially higher among schools with higher shares of children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds (OR: 3.58).	0
NewsClaims	3698	This study is ongoing and study participants are planned to be tested every three to five weeks at 10 different points during the 2020/2021 academic year.	0
NewsClaims	3699	A population based cohort in the United Kingdom among 9 334 392 adults aged 65 years and under found that in contrast to wave 1, evidence existed of increased risk of reported SARS-CoV-2 infection and covid-19 outcomes among adults living with children of any age during wave 2 (hazard ratio 1.06 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.08).	0
NewsClaims	3700	However, this did not translate into a materially increased risk of covid-19 mortality, and absolute increases in risk were small [16].	0
NewsClaims	3701	Children tend to have less severe COVID-19 outcomes than adults, meaning that children positive for SARS-CoV-2 may be under-represented in case-based reporting as well as in studies that have not tested asymptomatic contacts [17].	0
NewsClaims	3702	Population-based studies, such as the ones using representative sampling of individuals with COVID-19 compatible symptoms or studies that include testing regardless of symptoms, may help to address this gap.	0
NewsClaims	3703	SARS-CoV-2 in Educational Settings	0
NewsClaims	3704	(Last update 26 March 2021)	0
NewsClaims	3705	Although there is some heterogeneity in the findings from the literature noted above, there is general consensus from research from several European settings that schools do not act as amplifiers of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and rather that case rates in schools are following background levels of community transmission [17, 28].	0
NewsClaims	3706	A study from Sweden compared onward transmission from students in lower-secondary schools (typical student age 14-16 years) that remained open with onward transmission from students in upper-secondary schools (typical student age 17-19 years) that were closed during the study period.	0
NewsClaims	3707	The study found a small increase in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in parents of lower-secondary school students (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.03-1.32), but double the risk for lower-secondary school teachers versus upper-secondary school teachers (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.52-2.67) [23].	0
NewsClaims	3708	This may lead to the need for school closures, either in response to school-specific outbreaks or to alleviate current or anticipated risk of or increase in community transmission and the pressure on healthcare systems [26].	0
NewsClaims	3709	School closures have a negative impact on children and adolescents’ health and wellbeing, as well as on their long term educational outcomes [27], so keeping schools open when possible is a key objective [28].	0
NewsClaims	3710	School closures, if deemed necessary, should initially be arranged for children in older age groups.	0
NewsClaims	3711	Another modelling study from Denmark which assumed that children under 10 years of age were 50% less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults, indicates that, all other measures being constant, opening only primary schools (grades 0-4) in February 2021 would not lead to a substantial increase in new cases or hospitalisations, provided that the transmissibility of variant B.1.1.7 increases by 40% compared to the previously circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses.	0
NewsClaims	3712	Case rates increased slightly, while hospital admissions remained stable through February and March [30].	0

NewsClaims	3719	Multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 have been observed in several occupational settings within and beyond the EU/EEA and the UK, including slaughterhouses, meat processing plants, mines and building sites [31,36,37].	0

NewsClaims	3750	Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital infectious diseases physician Juan Dumois, M.D., clears the air by debunking five coronavirus myths.	0
NewsClaims	3751	MYTH: Kids can’t catch it	0
NewsClaims	3752	Kids can catch it.	0
NewsClaims	3753	In general, they are not as likely to get as sick as some adults become, but some kids can get quite sick.	0
NewsClaims	3754	They are most likely to be affected the younger they are (12 months and under).	0
NewsClaims	3755	MYTH: Children are only contagious if they show symptoms	0
NewsClaims	3756	It is a scary thought, but you can still have and spread coronavirus even if you don’t have symptoms.	0
NewsClaims	3757	The No.	0
NewsClaims	3758	1 guideline is: No matter who or what you touch, if you wash your hands before you touch your face, you probably won’t catch it.	0
NewsClaims	3759	The risk of catching coronavirus is lower for kids who are at their home and not exposed to other kids at school or daycare.	0
NewsClaims	3760	It is good for families to practice habits like good hand hygiene and avoid kissing on the lips or sharing drinks.	0
NewsClaims	3761	MYTH: Masks are enough to protect you	0
NewsClaims	3762	The CDC recently suggested that people wear cloth face masks in public if they can’t consistently stay 6 feet away from all other persons.	0
NewsClaims	3763	But masks can be harmful if they give you a false sense of security.	0
NewsClaims	3764	Cloth masks help to keep infected people from spreading viruses when they cough or talk, but their effectiveness for protecting you from other people’s viruses can be very poor, depending on the thickness of the fabric and the number of fabric layers in the mask.	0
NewsClaims	3765	Typically, masks have been used in hospital settings to protect healthcare workers and as a reminder to not touch your face, but that’s with trained people.	0
NewsClaims	3766	When wearing a cloth face mask in public, remember to not touch your face until you have cleaned your hands, and make sure that the mask covers your nose and wraps under your chin.	0
NewsClaims	3767	And definitely wear a mask if you have to be in public with any beginning symptoms of illness, like a scratchy throat, a little cough, or change in your senses of taste or smell.	0
NewsClaims	3768	We have learned that pets may be infected with the virus, but they may have no symptoms.	0
NewsClaims	3769	Because animals can spread other diseases to people, it's always a good idea to wash your hands after handling your pets before you eat or touch your face.	0

NewsClaims	3773	Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial	0
NewsClaims	3774	Background	0
NewsClaims	3775	Azithromycin, an antibiotic with potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, has been used to treat COVID-19, but evidence from community randomised trials is lacking.	0
NewsClaims	3776	We aimed to assess the effectiveness of azithromycin to treat suspected COVID-19 among people in the community who had an increased risk of complications.	0
NewsClaims	3777	Methods	0
NewsClaims	3778	In this UK-based, primary care, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive platform randomised trial of interventions against COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course (PRINCIPLE), we randomly assigned people aged 65 years and older, or 50 years and older with at least one comorbidity, who had been unwell for 14 days or less with suspected COVID-19, to usual care plus azithromycin 500 mg daily for three days, usual care plus other interventions, or usual care alone.	0
NewsClaims	3779	The trial had two coprimary endpoints measured within 28 days from randomisation: time to first self-reported recovery, analysed using a Bayesian piecewise exponential, and hospital admission or death related to COVID-19, analysed using a Bayesian logistic regression model.	0
NewsClaims	3780	Eligible participants with outcome data were included in the primary analysis, and those who received the allocated treatment were included in the safety analysis.	0
NewsClaims	3781	The trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN86534580.	0
NewsClaims	3782	Findings	0
NewsClaims	3783	The first participant was recruited to PRINCIPLE on April 2, 2020.	0
NewsClaims	3784	The azithromycin group enrolled participants between May 22 and Nov 30, 2020, by which time 2265 participants had been randomly assigned, 540 to azithromycin plus usual care, 875 to usual care alone, and 850 to other interventions.	0
NewsClaims	3785	2120 (94%) of 2265 participants provided follow-up data and were included in the Bayesian primary analysis, 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group, 823 in the usual care alone group, and 797 in other intervention groups.	0
NewsClaims	3786	402 (80%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 631 (77%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group reported feeling recovered within 28 days.	0
NewsClaims	3787	We found little evidence of a meaningful benefit in the azithromycin plus usual care group in time to first reported recovery versus usual care alone (hazard ratio 1·08, 95% Bayesian credibility interval [BCI] 0·95 to 1·23), equating to an estimated benefit in median time to first recovery of 0·94 days (95% BCI −0·56 to 2·43).	0
NewsClaims	3788	The probability that there was a clinically meaningful benefit of at least 1·5 days in time to recovery was 0·23.	0
NewsClaims	3789	16 (3%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 28 (3%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group were hospitalised (absolute benefit in percentage 0·3%, 95% BCI −1·7 to 2·2).	0
NewsClaims	3790	There were no deaths in either study group.	0
NewsClaims	3791	Safety outcomes were similar in both groups.	0
NewsClaims	3792	Two (1%) of 455 participants in the azothromycin plus usual care group and four (1%) of 668 participants in the usual care alone group reported admission to hospital during the trial, not related to COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	3793	Interpretation	0
NewsClaims	3794	Our findings do not justify the routine use of azithromycin for reducing time to recovery or risk of hospitalisation for people with suspected COVID-19 in the community.	0
NewsClaims	3795	These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antimicrobial resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK.	0

NewsClaims	3935	No, Coronavirus Was Not Caused by 'Bat Soup'–But Here's What Researchers Think May Be to Blame	0
NewsClaims	3936	When news of any new, fast-spreading virus starts making the rounds, two things happen: public panic ensues and misinformation starts to proliferate—and the new coronavirus has sparked both.	0
NewsClaims	3937	In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus—now known as SAR-CoV-2 (initially named 2019-nCoV)—was detected in Wuhan, a city in Central China's Hubei province.	0
NewsClaims	3938	Since then, more than 9.6 million people worldwide have developed the infection, and at least 490,000 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University's real-time tracker, which maps confirmed cases of the illness we now know as COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	3939	The US accounts for more than 2.4 million of those cases and nearly 125,000 deaths.	0
NewsClaims	3940	While health officials across the world—and, honestly, the entire world in general—try to figure out what exactly the new coronavirus is (Where did it start?	0
NewsClaims	3941	How is it transmitted?	0
NewsClaims	3942	What's making it so infectious?	0
NewsClaims	3943	"(Seriously—the searches for ""bat soup"" in Google Trends truly skyrocketed)."	0
NewsClaims	3944	"Where exactly did the ""bat soup"" claim come from?"	0
NewsClaims	3945	According to Foreign Policy, a video recently surfaced of a Chinese woman holding an entire bat with chopsticks, appearing to eat the creature in a soup.	0
NewsClaims	3946	The Daily Mail also reported on the video, and YouTube channel RT shared the footage.	0
NewsClaims	3947	The clip was reportedly met with outrage from Twitter users, who quickly began calling out Chinese eating habits as the cause of the outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	3948	But here's the thing, per Foreign Policy: That video in question reportedly wasn't filmed in Wuhan or China in general—the woman in the video, who news outlets have identified as Wang Mengyun, is a host of an online travel show who was actually eating a dish in Palau, an island country located in the western Pacific ocean.	0
NewsClaims	3949	The video was also reportedly filmed in 2016—well before the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.	0
NewsClaims	3950	Mengyun has also reportedly apologized for the footage.	0
NewsClaims	3951	"""I am sorry everyone."	0
NewsClaims	3952	"I should not have eaten a bat,"" she said, according to the South China Morning Post."	0
NewsClaims	3953	“[I] had no idea during filming that there was such a virus,” she continued.	0
NewsClaims	3954	“I realized it only recently.”	0
NewsClaims	3955	So where did coronavirus originate—and is it linked to bats at all?	0
NewsClaims	3956	This is where it gets tricky: Coronaviruses in general are a large family of viruses that can affect many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, and bats, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).	0
NewsClaims	3957	In rare cases, those viruses are also zoonotic, which means they can pass between humans and animals—as was the case with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory system (SARS), two severe coronaviruses in people.	0
NewsClaims	3958	But a large number of people diagnosed with the virus reportedly didn't have exposure to the wet markets, and now it's clear that the virus is primarily spreading person-to-person, says the CDC.	0
NewsClaims	3959	"While experts still haven't pinpointed the actual source, new research released online by the CDC on April 21 concludes that SARS-CoV-2 ""is probably a novel recombinant virus""—one that has features closely related to coronaviruses found in bats and pangolins (scaly-skinned mammals)."	0
NewsClaims	3960	However, none of the existing coronaviruses represents its immediate ancestor, notes Susanna K. P. Lau, MBBS, MD, head of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong, and colleagues, who analyzed the genome of the novel coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	3961	"""Although the Wuhan market was initially suspected to be the epicenter of the epidemic, the immediate source remains elusive,"" Dr. Lau and colleagues write."	0
NewsClaims	3962	If the Wuhan market were the source, it's possible, they say, that bats carrying the bat coronavirus were mixed in the market, enabling a new combination virus to develop.	0
NewsClaims	3963	"""However, no animal samples from the market were reported to be positive,"" the team points out."	0
NewsClaims	3964	"What's more, neither the first identified case in a human nor other early patients had visited the market, ""suggesting the possibility of an alternative source."""	0
NewsClaims	3965	"Dr. Lau and colleagues' study, released ahead of publication in the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, also throws cold water on an Internet rumor that the virus may have been created in a lab: ""there is currently no evidence showing that SARS-CoV-2 is an artificial recombinant."""	0
NewsClaims	3966	Another recent paper in Nature Medicine underscores that point.	0
NewsClaims	3967	Andersen and colleagues' research implicates bats and possibly pangolins.	0
NewsClaims	3968	"Overall, the origin of the novel coronavirus is still filled with what-ifs and maybes, but even if bats are partly to blame, the likelihood that ""bat soup"" played a role is just an extremely misinformed (and potentially xenophobic) rumor."	0
NewsClaims	3969	The information in this story is accurate as of press time.	0
NewsClaims	3970	However, as the situation surrounding COVID-19 continues to evolve, it's possible that some data have changed since publication.	0

NewsClaims	4155	Here are the top 10 conspiracy theories making the rounds.	0
NewsClaims	4156	Blaming 5G	0
NewsClaims	4157	The latter are waves/photons, while the former are biological particles composed of proteins and nucleic acids.	0
NewsClaims	4158	But that isn’t really the point — conspiracy theories are enticing because they often link two things which at first might appear be correlated; in this case, the rapid rollout of 5G networks was taking place at the same time the pandemic hit.	0
NewsClaims	4159	Cue a viral meme linking the two, avidly promoted by anti-vaccine activists who have long been spreading fears about electromagnetic radiation, egged on by the Kremlin.	0
NewsClaims	4160	Even so, this conspiracy theory — after being spread by celebrities with big social media followings — has led to cellphone towers being set on fire in the UK and elsewhere.	0
NewsClaims	4161	Bill Gates as scapegoat	0
NewsClaims	4162	Most conspiracy theories, like the viruses they resemble, constantly mutate and have several variants circulating at any one time.	0
NewsClaims	4163	Many of these plots and subplots seem to involve Bill Gates, who became a new target of disinformation after gently criticizing the defunding of the World Health Organization.	0
NewsClaims	4164	According to the New York Times, anti-vaxxers, members of QAnon and right-wing pundits have seized on a video of a 2015 Ted talk given by Gates — where he discussed the Ebola outbreak and warned of a new pandemic — to bolster their claims he had foreknowledge of the COVID pandemic or even purposely caused it.	0
NewsClaims	4165	There is some truth in this, of course: vaccinating much of the world’s population may well be the only way to avoid an eventual death toll in the tens of millions.	0
NewsClaims	4166	But anti-vaxxers don’t believe vaccines work.	0
NewsClaims	4167	Instead some have spread the myth that Gates wants to use a vaccination program to implant digital microchips that will somehow track and control people.	0
NewsClaims	4168	The spread of misinformation has meant that ID2020, a small non-profit that focuses on establishing digital IDs for poorer people around the world, has had to call in the FBI.	0
NewsClaims	4169	(The Cornell Alliance for Science is partly funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.)	0
NewsClaims	4170	The virus escaped from a Chinese lab	0
NewsClaims	4171	This one at least has the benefit of being plausible.	0
NewsClaims	4172	It is true that the original epicenter of the epidemic, the Chinese city of Wuhan, also hosts a virology institute where researchers have been studying bat coronaviruses for a long time.	0
NewsClaims	4173	One of these researchers, Shi Zhengli, a prominent virologist who spent years collecting bat dung samples in caves and was a lead expert on the earlier SARS outbreak, was sufficiently concerned about the prospect that she spent days frantically checking lab records to see if anything had gone wrong.	0
NewsClaims	4174	She admits breathing a “sigh of relief” when genetic sequencing showed that the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus did not match any of the viruses sampled and studied in the Wuhan Institute of Virology by her team.	0
NewsClaims	4175	However, the sheer coincidence of China’s lead institute studying bat coronaviruses being in the same city as the origin of the COVID outbreak has proven too juicy for conspiracists to resist.	0
NewsClaims	4176	The idea was seeded originally via a slick hour-long documentary produced by the Epoch Times, an English-language news outlet based in the United States with links to the Falun Gong religious cult that has long been persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).	0
NewsClaims	4177	The theory has now tipped into the mainstream, being reported in the Washington Post, the Times (UK) and many other outlets.	0
NewsClaims	4178	COVID was created as a biological weapon	0
NewsClaims	4179	According to Pew Research, “nearly three-in-10 Americans believe that COVID-19 was made in a lab,” either intentionally or accidentally (the former is more popular: specifically, 23 percent believe it was developed intentionally, with only 6 percent believing it was an accident).	0
NewsClaims	4180	This theory that the Chinese somehow created the virus is particularly popular on the US political right.	0
NewsClaims	4181	It gained mainstream coverage thanks to US Sen. Tom Cotton (Republican, Arkansas) who amplified theories first aired in the Washington Examiner (a highly conservative media outlet) that the Wuhan Institute of Virology “is linked to Beijing’s covert bio-weapons program.”	0
NewsClaims	4182	This theory can be easily debunked now that there is unambiguous scientific evidence — thanks to genetic sequencing — that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has entirely natural origins as a zoonotic virus originating in bats.	0
NewsClaims	4183	The Examiner has since added a correction at the top of the original piece admitting the story is probably false.	0
NewsClaims	4184	The US military imported COVID into China	0
NewsClaims	4185	The Chinese government responded to the anti-China theories with a conspiracy theory of its own that seeks to turn blame back around onto the United States.	0
NewsClaims	4186	For China, as the Atlantic reported, this conspiracy theory, and an accompanying attempt to rename COVID the “USA virus,”’ was a transparent “geopolitical ploy” — useful for domestic propaganda but not widely believed internationally.	0
NewsClaims	4187	GMOs are somehow to blame	0
NewsClaims	4188	Genetically modified crops have been a target of conspiracy theorists for years, so it was hardly a surprise to see GMOs blamed in the early stages of the COVID pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	4189	Anti-GMO activists have also tried to blame modern agriculture, which is strange, since the known path of the virus into the human population — as with Ebola, HIV and many others — was through the very ancient practice of people capturing and killing wildlife.	0
NewsClaims	4190	Ironically, GMOs will almost certainly be part of any vaccine solution.	0
NewsClaims	4191	If any of the ongoing 70 vaccine projects work (which is a big if), that would be pretty much the only guaranteed way the world can get out of the COVID mess.	0
NewsClaims	4192	If GMOs do help save the world from the curse of COVID, maybe they’ll stop being a dirty word.	0
NewsClaims	4193	COVID-19 doesn’t actually exist	0
NewsClaims	4194	According to professional conspiracy theorists like David Icke and InfoWars’ Alex Jones, COVID-19 doesn’t actually exist, but is a plot by the globalist elite to take away our freedoms.	0
NewsClaims	4195	Early weaker versions of this theory were prevalent on the political right in the notion that the novel coronavirus would be “no worse than flu” and later versions are now influencing anti-lockdown protests across several states in the US.	0
NewsClaims	4196	Because believers increasingly refuse to observe social distancing measures, they could directly help to spread the epidemic further in their localities and increase the resulting death rate.	0
NewsClaims	4197	The pandemic is being manipulated by the ‘deep state’	0
NewsClaims	4198	Some believe that a “deep state” of America’s elite is plotting to undermine the president — and that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the face of the US coronavirus pandemic response — is a secret member.	0
NewsClaims	4199	Fauci’s expression of disbelief when the deep state was mentioned during a press briefing supposedly gave the game away.	0
NewsClaims	4200	COVID is a plot by Big Pharma	0
NewsClaims	4201	Many conspiracy theory promoters are in reality clever actors trying to sell quack products.	0
NewsClaims	4202	NaturalNews, another conspiracist site, sells all manner of pills, potions and prepper gear.	0
NewsClaims	4203	These conspiracists depend for their market on getting people to believe that evidence-based (i.e.	0
NewsClaims	4204	conventional) medicine doesn’t work and is a plot by big pharmaceutical companies to make us ill.	0
NewsClaims	4205	Big Pharma conspiracies are a staple of anti-vaccination narratives, so it is hardly surprising that they have transmuted into the age of the coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	4206	COVID death rates are inflated	0
NewsClaims	4207	Another far-right meme is the idea that COVID death rates are being inflated and therefore there is no reason to observe lockdown regulations or other social distancing measures.	0
NewsClaims	4208	Prominent in promoting this myth is Dr. Annie Bukacek, whose speech warning that COVID death certificates are being manipulated has been viewed more than a quarter of a million times on YouTube.	0
NewsClaims	4209	Bukacek appears in a white lab coat and with a stethoscope around her neck, making her look like an authoritative medical source.	0
NewsClaims	4210	Dig a little deeper, however, as Rolling Stone magazine did, and it turns out she’s actually a far-right anti-vaccination and anti-abortion activist, previously noted for bringing tiny plastic fetuses into the Montana state legislature.	0
NewsClaims	4211	Her insistence that COVID death rates are inflated has, of course, no basis in fact.	0
NewsClaims	4212	More likely the current death toll is a serious under-count.	0
NewsClaims	4213	T0 further clarify the issue, the Centers for Disease Control has published information about excess deaths associated with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4214	How to recognize and debunk conspiracy theories	0
NewsClaims	4215	It is important to speak out and combat online misinformation and conspiracist narratives, whether on COVID or climate change or anything else.	0
NewsClaims	4216	This handbook (PDF) by John Cook and Stephan Lewandowsky, both of whom have extensive experience in combating climate denialism, is an essential tool.	0
NewsClaims	4217	Note: As in previous coverage, it is our policy to avoid linking directly to websites and social media feeds that promote misinformation and conspiracy theories, so as not to drive traffic to them and give them higher visibility.	0

NewsClaims	4243	Disclaimer: The objective of this report is to provide a snapshot overview of the current trends and insights into disinformation activities related to COVID-19/Coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	4244	The report draws on open sources, does not provide a comprehensive or complete overview and focusses primarily on the external dimension, in line with the European External Action Service (EEAS) mandate.	0
NewsClaims	4245	The report was authored by the EEAS Strategic Communications and Information Analysis Division, which contributes to the EU’s efforts to counter disinformation, including through detection, analysis and exposure of disinformation campaigns.	0
NewsClaims	4246	In addressing disinformation and identifying and analysing disinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the EEAS is working closely with the European Commission, European Parliament services and EU Member States.	0
NewsClaims	4247	The EEAS also cooperates on this issue with international partners (G7, NATO and civil society).	0
NewsClaims	4248	The results are regularly published on EUvsDisinfo.eu and social media channels.	0
NewsClaims	4249	Insights are shared with EU institutions and EU Member States in real time, including through the Rapid Alert System on Disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	4250	Summary	0
NewsClaims	4251	Since the last special report, COVID-19 related online mis- and disinformation decreased and shifted focus towards vaccines, according to multiple analyses of thousands of available fact-checks since the beginning of the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	4252	The spread and reach of mis- and disinformation online remains worryingly high.	0
NewsClaims	4253	A lack of tools and access to relevant data hinders research to estimate its direct impact on human behaviour.	0
NewsClaims	4254	Based on current developments and observations, we expect that the health crisis around COVID-19 will continue to provide ample of opportunities worldwide for the spread of mis- and disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	4255	They can be expected especially concerning tightening confinement measures as well as vaccine development and distribution.	0
NewsClaims	4256	State actors like China and Russia are maximising the effect of the so-called “vaccine diplomacy” in their communication efforts, most likely with the intent to enhance their reputation and economic position abroad.	0
NewsClaims	4257	They are leveraging diplomatic channels, state-controlled media and networks of supportive and alternative media outlets and social media to distribute their messages.	0
NewsClaims	4258	While in the MENA region disinformation narratives are not yet at play given the delayed COVID-19 second wave, in Syria the regime continues to leverage COVID-19 to advance its political agenda through recurring disinformation on the EU sanctions.	0
NewsClaims	4259	the regime continues to leverage COVID-19 to advance its political agenda through recurring disinformation on the EU sanctions.	0
NewsClaims	4260	In the EU and its neighbouring countries, pro-Kremlin outlets continue to amplify voices that downplay the threat of the virus and aim to undermine governments’ strategies of curbing the second wave of infections.	0
NewsClaims	4261	Assessments facilitated by the EU Code of Practice on Disinformation show continuous efforts by platforms to curb the spread of mis- and disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	4262	However, proliferation, profitability and visibility of potentially harmful information remains high across online platforms.	0
NewsClaims	4263	The work of fact-checkers and professional, independent media since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic remains indispensable to uncover and debunk false, misleading and potentially harmful information.	0
NewsClaims	4264	Fact-checking spread has shown to have a positive impact in reducing misinformation about specific COVID-19 related claims[1].	0
NewsClaims	4265	This activity is paramount in mitigating the potential harmful consequences and enhancing societal resilience.	0
NewsClaims	4266	In detail: COVID-19 related disinformation, misinformation and other activities (May – November)	0
NewsClaims	4267	With respect to the ongoing debate[2] to establish clearly outlined definitions for various types of false, misleading and potentially harmful information, this report will make conscious references to misinformation, which “refers to untrue information that individuals spread without any intent to mislead, though the effects of such misinformation can still be harmful” and disinformation, which describes “verifiably false content that is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, and may cause public harm”.	0
NewsClaims	4268	These are often part of Information Influence Operations, which refer to coordinated efforts by either domestic or foreign actors to influence a target audience using a range of deceptive means, including suppressing independent information sources in combination with disinformation.	0
NewsClaims	4269	If in earlier reporting periods, pro-Kremlin media cast doubts on EU actions and solidarity in response to COVID-19, now the main narrative shifted towards vaccines.	0
NewsClaims	4270	Triumphant narratives[4] about Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine replaced them.	0
NewsClaims	4271	Western vaccine manufacturers are openly mocked on multi-lingual Russian state-controlled media, including for developing “the monkey vaccine”[7] (as some of the manufacturers use a chimpanzee viral vector).	0
NewsClaims	4272	In some cases, this lead to conspiracy narratives that the vaccine will “turn people into monkeys”[8].	0
NewsClaims	4273	In Italy pro-Kremlin media consistently amplify [13] local voices, which call the government’s strategy of handling the second wave of the infections senseless, including claims that the wearing of masks is useless.	0
NewsClaims	4274	Pro-Kremlin media has also called COVID-19 restrictions “a result of a bizarre psychosis and collective paranoia[14]”.	0
NewsClaims	4275	In Germany, RT has also amplified voices questioning the threat of COVID-19, and calling testing and mask-wearing into question.	0
NewsClaims	4276	An RT video[16] interview with a local physician expressing such views has been viewed over 1 million times.	0
NewsClaims	4277	There is a risk that COVID-19 related disinformation may increase as Europe is undergoing new lockdowns.	0
NewsClaims	4278	The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) documented[17] the strategical use and rapid, international spread of disinformation during the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	4279	A completely fabricated report of fatal US COVID-19 vaccine trials was circulated via the website of the so-called “Luhansk People’s Republic” in the non-government-controlled areas, and “achieved widespread dissemination in multiple languages and across multiple communities” from the US to Australia – despite fact checks by multiple organisations across Europe.	0
NewsClaims	4280	The press release was published the day after Russia announced plans to mass-produce its own vaccine in a matter of weeks[18].	0
NewsClaims	4281	Since the last reporting period (23rd April – 18th May), over 100 new examples of pro-Kremlin linked disinformation about COVID-19 have been added to the EUvsDisinfo public database.	0
NewsClaims	4282	Articles containing these examples of disinformation received over 230 thousand likes, shares, comments on social media.	0
NewsClaims	4283	Since the outbreak of the pandemic, EUvsDisinfo has collected over 640 examples of pro-Kremlin disinformation related to COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4284	According to our findings, currently the volume of pro-Kremlin disinformation surrounding the pandemic is smaller compared to spring (likely due to other events presenting fertile ground for disinformation campaigns, including Navalny poisoning, protests in Belarus, etc.	0
NewsClaims	4285	).	0
NewsClaims	4286	An analysis across more than 9000 fact checks by the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN) underlined that false claims, disinformation and conspiracies also follow in magnitude and focus on the informational needs of users[19].	0
NewsClaims	4287	First Draft explained this trend with information vacuums (“data deficits”[20]), where high levels of demand for information only meet low supply of available authoritative information.	0
NewsClaims	4288	Overall, Google Trends data offers indicators that online public interest in COVID-19 related information appears to be substantially lower compared to the beginning of the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	4289	[21]	0
NewsClaims	4290	With the Middle-East and North-Africa (MENA) region potentially experiencing a delayed second COVID-19 wave compared to Europe, it is likely to assume a similarly delayed resurge of disinformation and a prevalence of vaccines-related disinformation narratives, if any.	0
NewsClaims	4291	In Syria, the regime continues to leverage COVID-19 to advance its political goals.	0
NewsClaims	4292	In line with a recurring narrative, the regime’s representative to the UN blamed the EU and the US for allegedly hindering through their sanctions the medical assistance to Syrians in the COVID-19 context as well as the reconstruction process and the returns of refugees.	0
NewsClaims	4293	[22]	0
NewsClaims	4294	A variety of false information and misleading narratives on COVID-19 have been circulating in the Western Balkans media environment since mid-March.	0
NewsClaims	4295	Local independent fact-checkers confirmed a multitude of cases of misinformation, including in relation to vaccines and health advice.	0
NewsClaims	4296	Many of these included a supportive narrative focused on children and the need to protect them, targeting family audiences.	0
NewsClaims	4297	[23] Across the region, claims that COVID-19 is a ‘fraud’ and that face masks are ‘harmful’ were shared widely on platforms such as Facebook, often in the form of sweeping statements based on ‘twisted’ statistical data.	0
NewsClaims	4298	[24] Debunking efforts were undertaken by fact-checking organisations [25] and, occasionally, also by traditional news outlets [26] .	0
NewsClaims	4299	Since spring 2020, the fact-checking community in Turkey stepped up its efforts[27] to debunk COVID-19-related misinformation.	0
NewsClaims	4300	In autumn, the number of COVID-19 related debunks was lower.	0
NewsClaims	4301	In this period, claims about the ineffectiveness or risk[28] of wearing masks, different ‘natural methods’ to prevent or test for [29] COVID-19 and some conspiracy narratives (like masks carrying tracking chips[30]) were debunked.	0
NewsClaims	4302	Occasionally these debunks were vaccine-related.	0
NewsClaims	4303	Since the beginning of the outbreak, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has utilised the pandemic to positively influence its image abroad, both by highlighting its efforts in countering COVID-19 and/or attacking and casting doubt[31] on any criticism towards it.	0
NewsClaims	4304	Generally, the communication strategy appears to be two-fold: blaming others[35] and emphasising own successes.	0
NewsClaims	4305	The current trend marks the continuation of the “mask diplomacy” now focusing on vaccines and correspondingly dubbed “vaccine diplomacy”[36].	0
NewsClaims	4306	China’s “vaccine diplomacy” is well-advanced and promoted in state-controlled media: China is promising preferential access to its COVID-19 vaccines[37] to developing countries across Asia[38], Africa[39] and Latin America[40].	0
NewsClaims	4307	According to large-scale surveys by Pew Research Center[41] and YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Project[42] (called an “illustration of Western brainwashing”[43] in the CCP-owned Global Times), China’s image abroad has suffered over the handling of the COVID-19 crisis and “vaccine diplomacy” is seen as a way to bolster diplomatic ties[44].	0
NewsClaims	4308	Chinese media and officials on Twitter have criticized the US handling of the crisis[45] and their withdrawal from multilateral initiatives[46] while reinforcing China’s commitment to the United Nations system.	0
NewsClaims	4309	In parallel, some media and officials have dismissed the US’ advances on vaccine[47] and accused it in pursuing a “new cold war”[48].	0
NewsClaims	4310	Chinese officials have also publicly[49] pointed at Australia’s call for an independent investigation on the origin of the virus as one reason for strained relations between the countries.	0
NewsClaims	4311	Australia’s trade with China has been affected[50] as a result.	0
NewsClaims	4312	Narratives shared by Chinese state-controlled media, but also by Chinese officials on Twitter notably[51] emphasize China’s response to COVID-19 as a deep commitment to multilateralism.	0
NewsClaims	4313	Domestic success stories on rapid and large-scale testing (like in Qingdao[52] and Kashgar[53]), reopening[54] of the country and the economy [55] are being promoted outside the country.	0
NewsClaims	4314	In official diplomatic channels, it translates into the promotion of China’s commitment to COVAX[56] as a sign of mutual support and justifies cooperation (like with Finland[57], Morocco[58] and other African countries[59]).	0
NewsClaims	4315	Externally, emphasis on multilateralism is tied to objectives like building a “global community of health”[60] and China’s recovering economy is depicted as exceptional and beneficial[61] to the post-pandemic world.	0
NewsClaims	4316	Social Media Platforms	0
NewsClaims	4317	The European Commission’s most recent assessment of reports[62] provided by the signatories of the EU Code of Practice on Disinformation, which highlight the actions taken to limit disinformation on COVID-19 on signatories’ respective platforms, presents the efforts to address disinformation around COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4318	Actions by signatories range from the promotion of authoritative information sources to limiting the appearance of content containing false or misleading information, cooperation with fact-checkers as well as review of rules regarding online advertisement.	0
NewsClaims	4319	Platforms also established dedicated portals to update users on their actions to better protect users during the pandemic[63].	0
NewsClaims	4320	Despite these continuous efforts, academic research showed that mis- and disinformation continue to thrive online.	0
NewsClaims	4321	The Oxford Internet Institute found and analysed over 8000 COVID-related videos containing misinformation and conspiracies that were “shared almost 20 million times on social media, which is more than the shares gathered by the five largest English-language news sources on YouTube combined”.	0
NewsClaims	4322	[64] A study published in Nature Magazine shows that the situation could be worse on less compliant and emerging social media platforms.	0
NewsClaims	4323	[65]	0
NewsClaims	4324	The same study highlights that cross-platform traffic undermines individual platforms’ actions, which suggests a need for closer cooperation between them to effectively curb the dissemination and spread of potentially harmful material.	0
NewsClaims	4325	The need for better access to platform data to estimate impact, spread and trends of misinformation narratives remains largely unaddressed, despite privacy compliant proposals like the creation of a “Google Trends” for social media platforms[66].	0
NewsClaims	4326	August 2020 study[67] from non-profit organisation Avaaz estimated that “[g]lobal health misinformation spreading networks spanning at least five countries generated an estimated 3.8 billion views on Facebook in the last year.” Peaking in April 2020, “[h]ealth misinformation spreading websites at the heart of the networks received up to 460 million views on Facebook.” Avaaz concluded that Facebook is “failing to keep people safe and informed during the pandemic”, but could “provide all users who have seen misinformation with independently fact-checked corrections” and downgrade misinformation systematically in users’ news feeds to address the problem.	0
NewsClaims	4327	Research[68] by threat intelligence company CounterAction highlighted that over two million Germans are part of Facebook groups where COVID-19 related mis- and disinformation is circulating and amplified.	0
NewsClaims	4328	According to the research, half of the analysed posts include language that incites people to harmful behaviour, mostly concerning the vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	4329	Data showed that engagement with misinformation is not limited to political fringes, but spans party affiliation and geography.	0
NewsClaims	4330	The economic incentives are an important driver for the spread of mis-and disinformation and remain strong.	0
NewsClaims	4331	Brussels-based NGO EU Disinfo Lab found[69] that “[i]t is possible to monetise disinformation or conspiratorial narratives on crowdfunding platforms both indirectly and directly” and that while “[s]ome crowdfunding platforms have taken action against instances of monetisation attempts connected to COVID-19 disinformation and scams […] these actions seem incoherent and are not regularly enforced.” These monetisation streams continued even when the content in question has been demonetised or removed on other social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube.	0
NewsClaims	4332	The Global Disinformation Index (GDI) found[70] that over one-third (about 200) of English language websites publishing high volumes of divisive and polarising content on inter alia COVID-19 carry advertisement which generates an estimated US$350 000 in monthly income for these websites.	0
NewsClaims	4333	“Google, as the market leader, is the ad exchange most commonly found on these worst offender sites.” In the short term, GDI proposes advertisers use available information on worst offending sites to assess the overlap between their online marketing practices with their brand identity and adjust their ads targeting in cases of a mismatch.	0

NewsClaims	4488	When news of any new, fast-spreading virus starts making the rounds, two things happen: public panic ensues and misinformation starts to proliferate—and the new coronavirus has sparked both.	0
NewsClaims	4489	In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus—now known as SAR-CoV-2 (initially named 2019-nCoV)—was detected in Wuhan, a city in Central China's Hubei province.	0
NewsClaims	4490	The US accounts for more than 2.4 million of those cases and nearly 125,000 deaths.	0
NewsClaims	4491	While health officials across the world—and, honestly, the entire world in general—try to figure out what exactly the new coronavirus is (Where did it start?	0
NewsClaims	4492	How is it transmitted?	0
NewsClaims	4493	What's making it so infectious?	0
NewsClaims	4494	), one thing in particular is certainly	0
NewsClaims	4495	not	0
NewsClaims	4496	"(Seriously—the searches for ""bat soup"" in Google Trends truly skyrocketed)."	0
NewsClaims	4497	"Where exactly did the ""bat soup"" claim come from?"	0
NewsClaims	4498	According to	0
NewsClaims	4499	Foreign Policy	0
NewsClaims	4500	, a video recently surfaced of a Chinese woman holding an entire bat with chopsticks, appearing to eat the creature in a soup.	0
NewsClaims	4501	The	0
NewsClaims	4502	Daily Mail	0
NewsClaims	4503	also reported on the video, and YouTube channel RT shared the footage.	0
NewsClaims	4504	But here's the thing, per	0
NewsClaims	4505	Foreign Policy	0
NewsClaims	4506	: That video in question reportedly wasn't filmed in Wuhan or China in general—the woman in the video, who news outlets have identified as Wang Mengyun, is a host of an online travel show who was actually eating a dish in Palau, an island country located in the western Pacific ocean.	0
NewsClaims	4507	The video was also reportedly filmed in 2016—well before the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.	0
NewsClaims	4508	Mengyun has also reportedly apologized for the footage.	0
NewsClaims	4509	"""I am sorry everyone."	0
NewsClaims	4510	"I should not have eaten a bat,"" she said, according to the"	0
NewsClaims	4511	South China Morning Post	0
NewsClaims	4512	.	0
NewsClaims	4513	"""[I] had no idea during filming that there was such a virus,"" she continued."	0
NewsClaims	4514	"""I realized it only recently."""	0
NewsClaims	4515	So where did coronavirus originate—and is it linked to bats at all?	0
NewsClaims	4516	This is where it gets tricky: Coronaviruses in general are a large family of viruses that can affect many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, and bats, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).	0
NewsClaims	4517	Is it possible that the novel coronavirus began with an infected animal at the market—and then went on to person-to-person transmission once people were infected?	0

NewsClaims	4529	The information in this story is accurate as of press time.	0
NewsClaims	4530	However, as the situation surrounding COVID-19 continues to evolve, it's possible that some data have changed since publication.	0

NewsClaims	4532	Quiz: How Much Do You Know About Coronavirus?	0
NewsClaims	4533	News about the novel coronavirus is breaking nearly 24-7, which makes it challenging at best to keep up with the latest scientific evidence, especially when you’re bombarded by false or misleading claims on social media.	0
NewsClaims	4534	So how much do you really know about COVID-19?	0
NewsClaims	4535	Take our quiz to gauge how knowledgeable you are.	0
NewsClaims	4536	As the world continues to battle the coronavirus, it is also fighting a different sort of epidemic: misinformation.	0
NewsClaims	4537	This “infodemic” is just as harmful as COVID-19 itself, leading people to downplay the severity of the disease and ignore public health advice in favor of unproved treatments or “cures.” A recent survey by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and Gallup found that four in five Americans say the online spread of misinformation is the biggest problem facing the media.	0
NewsClaims	4538	Even with widely available evidence to the contrary, beliefs are hard to change.	0
NewsClaims	4539	Here are some of the most insidious falsehoods about the pandemic, and why they are wrong.	0
NewsClaims	4540	In reaction to calls for an independent, international investigation into how the virus originated, China has invited researchers from the World Health Organization to discuss the scope of such a mission.	0
NewsClaims	4541	In a video from a conspiracy theory film entitled Plandemic and a book she co-authored, a woman named Judy Mikovits, who once published a high-profile, now retracted study on chronic fatigue syndrome, makes unsubstantiated claims about National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, suggesting they have used their power to profit from disease.	0
NewsClaims	4542	Science and the Web site PolitiFact have fact-checked some of the film’s claims, many of which appear elsewhere in this article.	0
NewsClaims	4543	The video was widely shared by anti-vaxxers and the conspiracy theory group QAnon.	0
NewsClaims	4544	It garnered more than eight million views on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram before it was taken down because of its false statements.	0
NewsClaims	4545	Yet the large number of people who watched it suggests misinformation spreads perniciously.	0
NewsClaims	4546	Myth 3: COVID-19 is no worse than the flu.	0
NewsClaims	4547	Starting in the early days of the pandemic, Trump repeatedly claimed that the disease is not more dangerous than seasonal influenza.	0
NewsClaims	4548	But on September 9 the Washington Post published recordings of Trump​ telling journalist and author Bob Woodward—in interviews in early February and late March—that the president knew COVID-19 was more deadly than the flu and that he wanted to play down its severity.	0
NewsClaims	4549	Although COVID-19’s exact mortality rate is hard to pin down, epidemiologists suspect it is far higher than that of the flu.	0
NewsClaims	4550	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the latter causes roughly 12,000 to 61,000 deaths per year in the U.S. By contrast, COVID-19 has caused more than 191,000 deaths in the country as of this writing.	0
NewsClaims	4551	*	0
NewsClaims	4552	Many people also have partial immunity to the flu because of vaccination or prior infection, whereas most of the world has not yet encountered COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4553	So no, coronavirus is not “just the flu.”	0
NewsClaims	4554	Masks have long been known as an effective means of source control (preventing a sick patient from spreading a disease to others), but the early guidance was based, in part, on the fact that there was a shortage of high-quality “N95” and surgical masks.	0
NewsClaims	4555	We now know that cloth face masks can be an effective alternative.	0
NewsClaims	4556	But despite the evidence, many people still refuse to wear one, considering it a violation of civil liberties or emasculating.	0
NewsClaims	4557	Georgia’s governor Brian Kemp went so far as to sign an executive order banning city governments from implementing mask mandates.	0
NewsClaims	4558	And he sued Atlanta’s mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms when she instituted one, although he has now dropped the lawsuit.	0
NewsClaims	4559	But as coronavirus cases have spiked around the U.S. in recent months, even states that were once staunch holdouts have now implemented mask orders.	0
NewsClaims	4560	When a small, now widely criticized study in France suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine might be effective at treating the disease, Trump and others seized on it and have continued to tout the medication despite growing evidence that it does not benefit COVID-19 patients.	0
NewsClaims	4561	The Food and Drug Administration initially issued an emergency use authorization for the drug, but the agency later warned against its use because of the risk of heart problems and ultimately revoked its authorization.	0
NewsClaims	4562	And in June the National Institutes of Health halted its clinical trial of the medication, stating that while it was not harmful to patients, it did not provide any benefit.	0
NewsClaims	4563	Yet Trump continues to hype the drug.	0
NewsClaims	4564	Just a few weeks ago, he retweeted a video—viewed tens of millions of times before social media companies took it down—featuring Stella Immanuel, a Houston, Tex.–based physician (who has made questionable assertions in the past, including that doctors had used alien DNA in treatments and that demons cause certain medical conditions by having sex with people in their dreams) claiming hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4565	When thousands of people started taking to the streets in late May and June to protest the police killing of George Floyd and violence against Black Americans, some people questioned whether the mass gatherings would cause a spike in coronavirus cases.	0
NewsClaims	4566	But despite the concerns of Republicans such as Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio that the demonstrations pose as big a risk as going to church or the gym, such a marked increase from the protests has not been observed.	0
NewsClaims	4567	And those who did not attend the protests may actually have stayed home more than they would have otherwise.	0
NewsClaims	4568	The fact that the demonstrations happened outdoors, where the risk of transmission is much lower, and that many protesters wore masks likely prevented superspreading events.	0
NewsClaims	4569	Meanwhile, as states have reopened, there has been a notable increase in cases tied to bars and restaurants, as well as other indoor environments—likely because of the risk of airborne spread.	0
NewsClaims	4570	Myth 7: Spikes in cases are because of increased testing.	0
NewsClaims	4571	As coronavirus cases began surging in many parts of the U.S. in recent months, Trump has frequently claimed that these spikes are merely to the result of more people being tested.	0
NewsClaims	4572	He has tweeted that “without testing ... we would be showing almost no cases” and has said in interviews that the reason they appear to have gone up is because of increased testing.	0
NewsClaims	4573	If that scenario were true, we would expect the percentage of positive tests to go down.	0
NewsClaims	4574	But numerous analyses have shown the opposite.	0
NewsClaims	4575	The rate has risen in many states with big outbreaks (such as Arizona, Texas and Florida), while it has decreased in those that have controlled their outbreaks (such as New York), indicating that the national increase in positive tests reflects a true increase in cases.	0
NewsClaims	4576	Early on in the pandemic, some speculated that the polices chosen by the U.K. and Sweden gave the impression that they planned on letting the virus circulate through their population until they reached herd immunity—the point at which enough people are immune to the virus to prevent it from spreading to others.	0
NewsClaims	4577	(Both nations’ governments have denied that this idea was their official strategy, but the U.K. was late to issue a full lockdown, and Sweden had decided against widespread restrictions.)	0
NewsClaims	4578	There is a fundamental flaw with this approach, however: Experts estimate that roughly 60 to 70 percent of people would need to get COVID-19 to achieve herd immunity.	0
NewsClaims	4579	And given the relatively high mortality rate of the disease, letting it infect that many individuals could lead to millions of deaths.	0
NewsClaims	4580	That tragedy is what happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which roughly 50 million people are thought to have perished.	0
NewsClaims	4581	The U.K.’s COVID-19 death rate is among the world’s highest.	0
NewsClaims	4582	Sweden, for its part, has had significantly more deaths than neighboring countries, and its economy has suffered, despite not shutting down.	0
NewsClaims	4583	It is likely that many lives could have been saved if these countries had acted sooner.	0
NewsClaims	4584	Myth 9: Any vaccine will be unsafe and a bigger risk than getting COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4585	As scientists race to develop a vaccine against the disease, worrying reports have emerged that many people may refuse to get one once it is available.	0
NewsClaims	4586	Conspiracy theories about potential vaccines have circulated among anti-vax groups and in viral videos.	0
NewsClaims	4587	In Plandemic, Mikovits falsely claims that any COVID-19 vaccine will “kill millions” and that other vaccines have done so (in fact, vaccines save millions of lives each year).	0
NewsClaims	4588	Another conspiracy theory asserts that Bill Gates has a secret plan to use vaccines to implant trackable microchips in people; Gates has denied the claim, which is not supported by evidence.	0
NewsClaims	4589	Most Americans still support vaccination, yet the few voices of opposition have been growing.	0
NewsClaims	4590	A recent study observed that although clusters of anti-vaxxers on Facebook are smaller than pro-vaccination groups, they are more heavily interconnected with clusters of undecided people.	0
NewsClaims	4591	A recent Gallup poll found that one in three Americans would not get a COVID-19 vaccine if it were available today, with Republicans being less likely to be vaccinated than Democrats.	0
NewsClaims	4592	There is good reason to be cautious about the safety of a new vaccine, but that need for prudence is why the top contenders are currently conducting large-scale clinical trials in tens of thousands of people to determine safety and efficacy.	0
NewsClaims	4593	If one or more of them pass muster, it will be critical for people to get vaccinated to save lives—including, perhaps, their own.	0

NewsClaims	4613	In the official document, the magistrates assumed the conspiracy theory according to which business elites and global policies planned the pandemic in order to control the population through vaccines and establish a “new world order.”	0
NewsClaims	4614	A few days earlier, a group of Donald Trump supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol, disrupting the Congressional session that was to certify Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election.	0
NewsClaims	4615	The iconic image of the assault was that of Jacob Anthony Chansley, a man with a painted face and dressed in animal skin and horns.	0
NewsClaims	4616	Chansley calls himself “the shaman” of QAnon, one of the groups that participated in the Capitol break-in.	0
NewsClaims	4617	This movement is made up of followers of a conspiracy theory promoted by the U.S. far-right that claims Trump is leading the resistance against the political elites, businessmen and media who profess Satanism and practice pederasty.	0
NewsClaims	4618	Theories like QAnon have multiplied in Latin America in recent decades.	0
NewsClaims	4619	Although they rely on fake news disseminated massively through social networks, they are presented as “alternative information” and have an increasing impact on political systems, even affecting democratic institutions.	0
NewsClaims	4620	Conspiracies behind historical events	0
NewsClaims	4621	These theories consider that secret conspiracies are behind some of the most important events in history, and like fake news, are found in Internet forums, social networks and instant messaging applications: ideal channels to be disseminated.	0
NewsClaims	4622	It is a phenomenon that is difficult to define.	0
NewsClaims	4623	According to Peter Knight, it can apply to anything from elaborate theories to mere suspicions about hidden agendas.	0
NewsClaims	4624	Jack Bratich points out that one of the main characteristics of these theories is that they are labeled by society as “conspiracy theories” with the intention of marginalizing and dismissing them.	0
NewsClaims	4625	As a result, their believers tend to reinforce ties among themselves in order to seek identity reaffirmation in the face of a social majority that disdains their discourse.	0
NewsClaims	4626	In recent months, the world has witnessed unusual historical events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the start of vaccination to combat the virus, or the assault on the Capitol in the United States.	0
NewsClaims	4627	Although there have always been conspiracy hypotheses that seek to shed light on historical events, in exceptional circumstances such as the current one, they spread more effectively.	0
NewsClaims	4628	Some of the most recognized theories have emerged at critical junctures such as the French Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, the Crash of ’29, the World Wars, the Cold War, the Kennedy assassination, the HIV/AIDS pandemic or 9/11, to name a few.	0
NewsClaims	4629	Simple explanations such as these provide emotional reassurance to those who believe in them because they argue that the traumatic events that are occurring have a planned origin, i.e., they are intentionally provoked within the framework of a hidden plan and not by factors beyond their control.	0
NewsClaims	4630	Moreover, they acquire greater legitimacy when they are given credibility by the mass media itself.	0
NewsClaims	4631	Conspiracy theories in Latin America	0
NewsClaims	4632	In a region as convulsed as Latin America, conspiracy theories have played an important role.	0
NewsClaims	4633	Those with a global impact have coexisted with other more homegrown ones, such as the one that claims that, after the Soviet occupation of Germany, Adolf Hitler did not commit suicide but went into exile in Argentina, or one of the most recent ones that claims that former Peruvian president Alan García faked his death to escape justice.	0
NewsClaims	4634	For Mark Fenster, conspiracy theories can be effective in challenging the established order, simplifying complex political and historical events.	0
NewsClaims	4635	However, at other times they put the democratic system at risk because they can be used by extremist political groups to defame their rivals, condition electoral processes or stigmatize certain ethno-cultural, religious or political groups.	0
NewsClaims	4636	As pointed out by Karl Popper in The Open Society and its Enemies, political movements with authoritarian or totalitarian inclinations often disseminate these theories as an additional argument to discredit, persecute and repress the opposition.	0
NewsClaims	4637	These tales of hidden intrigues reinforce in their followers a Manichean vision of the world in which a minority (it can be a political, business or media elite, or an ethnic-cultural or religious group), the “bad guys”, are the ones guilty of conspiring in some way or another against the country or humanity from positions of power, while they, the “good guys”, lead the resistance.	0
NewsClaims	4638	Dictatorships and populists have resorted to conspiracy theories	0
NewsClaims	4639	In Latin America, both military dictatorships and populist movements have resorted to conspiracy theories to attack their opponents, dividing society into two antagonistic political camps.	0
NewsClaims	4640	In the 1970s, far-right academics in Argentina claimed that Jews were maneuvering a plan to transform Argentine Patagonia into a state similar to Israel.	0
NewsClaims	4641	At the beginning of the 21st century Chavista sectors in Venezuela accused the opposition of conspiring internationally with the United States and Colombia to provoke the assassination of President Hugo Chávez.	0
NewsClaims	4642	In 2016, during the plebiscite campaign about the peace accords in Colombia, extremist groups linked to the party of former President Alvaro Uribe spread the false theory that the negotiations between the government of Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC were a maneuver of “Castro-Chavism” to establish a “gay dictatorship” in the country.	0
NewsClaims	4643	In all cases these theories were used to point out who the enemies of the country are and, in this way, legitimize actions aimed at confronting them.	0
NewsClaims	4644	As Carlos Malamud points out, these discourses are not “conspiratorial” because they warn of the presence, sometimes real, of groups seeking to interfere in national affairs or subvert the established order, but because they are assigned a much greater influence and capacity than they have.	0
NewsClaims	4645	2021 is a year with many electoral processes in Latin America in which conspiracy theories, global or regional, will play an important role.	0
NewsClaims	4646	This is a crucial issue, although complex to analyze and difficult to combat.	0
NewsClaims	4647	They are complex to analyze because there is a risk of labeling dissident discourses as “conspiracy theories” just because they question the established order.	0
NewsClaims	4648	They are difficult to combat because those who believe in these types of theories do not do so because they consider them reasonable or proven, but because they reinforce a sense of individual or collective belonging to a particular group.	0

NewsClaims	4650	Dexamethasone and other corticosteroid drugs are effective treatments for seriously ill COVID-19 patients, according to a meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials including a total of more than 1,700 participants.	0
NewsClaims	4651	The analysis, conducted by a team at the World Health Organization (WHO) and published yesterday (September 2) in	0
NewsClaims	4652	JAMA	0
NewsClaims	4653	, concluded that the drugs reduced the risk of dying within 28 days compared with standard care or placebo.	0
NewsClaims	4654	The organization has issued new guidelines recommending use of the drugs in the treatment of patients with severe or critical COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4655	"""Steroids are a cheap and readily available medication, and our analysis has confirmed that they are effective in reducing deaths amongst the people most severely affected by Covid-19,"" Jonathan Sterne, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Bristol University who helped conduct the meta-analysis, tells"	0

NewsClaims	4657	.	0
NewsClaims	4658	"""The results were consistent across the trials and show benefit regardless of age or sex."""	0
NewsClaims	4659	Dexamethasone has been in use in hospitals as a COVID-19 treatment for seriously ill patients for several months now, after the UK RECOVERY trial reported in June that the drug reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients ill enough to require mechanical ventilation.	0
NewsClaims	4660	The new meta-analysis reviewed data from this and two other trials of dexamethasone, plus three trials of hydrocortisone and one small study of methylprednisolone.	0
NewsClaims	4661	All three drugs are often prescribed by doctors to help dampen inflammation and other immune system responses.	0
NewsClaims	4662	They had been proposed as potential COVID-19 treatments partly because patients who die from the disease often succumb to overreactive immune responses.	0
NewsClaims	4663	The WHO has cautioned that the findings do not mean that steroids should be given to all COVID-19 patients, and the organization currently recommends doctors not to prescribe the drugs to people with mild disease.	0
NewsClaims	4664	One study included in the meta-analysis found that corticosteroids might even increase mortality in non-severe patients.	0
NewsClaims	4665	It’s still not clear exactly when steroids should be given to patients with worsening disease for the best outcome, Nahid Bhadelia, the medical director of the Special Pathogens Unit at the Boston University School of Medicine, tells	0

NewsClaims	4675	Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are currently authorised for treating malaria and certain autoimmune diseases.	0
NewsClaims	4676	In addition to side effects affecting the heart, they are known to potentially cause liver and kidney problems, nerve cell damage that can lead to seizures (fits) and low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).	0
NewsClaims	4677	These medicines are being used in the context of the ongoing pandemic for treating patients with COVID-19 and investigated in clinical trials.	0
NewsClaims	4678	Results from large, well-designed studies are needed to make any conclusions.	0
NewsClaims	4679	Some clinical trials currently investigating the effectiveness of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 use higher doses than those recommended for the authorised indications.	0
NewsClaims	4680	While serious side effects can occur with recommended doses, higher doses can increase the risk of these side effects, including abnormal electrical activity that affects the heart rhythm (QT-prolongation).	0
NewsClaims	4681	Healthcare professionals are recommended to closely monitor patients with COVID-19 receiving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and to take into account pre-existing heart problems that can make patients more prone to heart rhythm issues.	0
NewsClaims	4682	They should carefully consider the possibility of side effects, particularly with higher doses, and exercise extra caution when combining treatment with other medicines such as azithromycin that may cause similar side effects on the heart.	0

NewsClaims	4697	"Even though the World Health Organization (WHO) has tried to dispel such myths surrounding ""miracle"" foods and coronavirus, misinformation continues to circulate."	0
NewsClaims	4698	Here are some of the most common myths debunked:	0
NewsClaims	4699	Myth 1: garlic	0
NewsClaims	4700	There is some evidence showing that garlic has antibacterial effects, with existing studies indicating the active compounds of garlic (including allicin, allyl alcohol and diallyl disulfide) are protective against some types of bacteria like salmonella and staphylococcus aureus.	0
NewsClaims	4701	However, research investigating garlic’s antiviral properties is limited.	0
NewsClaims	4702	Myth 2: lemons	0
NewsClaims	4703	However, many other citrus fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C.	0
NewsClaims	4704	Myth 3: vitamin C	0
NewsClaims	4705	As previously stated, Vitamin C is known to play a role in supporting the normal functioning of the immune system.	0
NewsClaims	4706	Yet, it’s not the only nutrient that maintains the the immune system.	0
NewsClaims	4707	Most of the misinformation on vitamin C and coronavirus comes from studies that have investigated the links between vitamin C and the common cold.	0
NewsClaims	4708	Despite claims online that vitamin C can prevent and treat the common cold, the evidence in support of this is not only limited, but conflicting too.	0
NewsClaims	4709	There are also significant differences between the common cold and coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	4710	There’s currently no strong evidence that supplementing with vitamin C will prevent or cure COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4711	Most adults will also meet their vitamin C requirements from a diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables.	0
NewsClaims	4712	Myth 4: alkaline foods	0
NewsClaims	4713	A pH below 7.0 is considered acidic, a 7.0 pH is neutral, and above pH 7.0 is alkaline.	0
NewsClaims	4714	However, many of these online sources give incorrect pH values to these foods.	0
NewsClaims	4715	For example, the pH of a lemon was said to be 9.9, when it’s actually very acidic, with a pH of 2.	0
NewsClaims	4716	There are claims that acidic foods can become alkaline after being metabolised by the body.	0
NewsClaims	4717	The body regulates acidity levels, regardless of the types of food being consumed.	0
NewsClaims	4718	Myth 5: keto diet	0
NewsClaims	4719	"This comes from the idea that it can ""boost"" the immune system."	0
NewsClaims	4720	Though one study showed that keto might prevent or treat the flu, this study used mice models.	0
NewsClaims	4721	This makes it difficult to know if keto would have a similar effect on humans at preventing or treating the flu.	0
NewsClaims	4722	Current advice	0
NewsClaims	4723	Alongside WHO advice, the BDA encourages people to consume a healthy, balanced diet to support the immune system.	0
NewsClaims	4724	A healthy and varied diet containing the five main food groups can help provide most people with the nutrients they need.	0
NewsClaims	4725	Most of the nutrients we already get from our regular diet (including copper, folate, iron, zinc, selenium, and vitamins A, B6, B12, C, and D) are all involved in maintaining normal immune function.	0
NewsClaims	4726	People are also encouraged to take protective measures against COVID-19, including washing hands frequently, maintaining social distancing, and following lockdown orders.	0
NewsClaims	4727	This is because our main source of vitamin D is sunlight – and because of lockdown measures, many of us aren’t getting enough sunlight exposure.	0
NewsClaims	4728	When it comes to online misinformation, it can sometimes be difficult to spot what is and isn’t true.	0
NewsClaims	4729	"But in general, a claim is likely to be ""fake"" if it:"	0
NewsClaims	4730	Recommends eating a specific food, drink, or supplement (especially in high doses) to cure and prevent coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	4731	Encourages restricting main food groups from your diet	0
NewsClaims	4732	"Includes buzzwords – such as ""cleanse"", ""cure"", ""treat"", ""boost"", ""detox"" or ""superfoods"" – when recommending a single food item or supplement"	0
NewsClaims	4733	It’s not provided by a reliable and trusted health authority or organisation, like the NHS or WHO.	0
NewsClaims	4734	Social media is a powerful and great tool.	0
NewsClaims	4735	However, it can also be a catalyst for spreading misinformation.	0
NewsClaims	4736	In addition, there are no EU approved nutrition and health claims that a single food or supplement can fight viral infections, like COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4737	The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that emerged in the city of Wuhan, China, last year and has since caused a large scale COVID-19 epidemic and spread to more than 70 other countries is the product of natural evolution, according to findings published today in the journal Nature Medicine.	0
NewsClaims	4738	"In addition to Andersen, authors on the paper, ""The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2,"" include Robert F. Garry, of Tulane University; Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney; Andrew Rambaut, of University of Edinburgh; W. Ian Lipkin, of Columbia University."	0
NewsClaims	4739	Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging widely in severity.	0
NewsClaims	4740	The first known severe illness caused by a coronavirus emerged with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China.	0
NewsClaims	4741	A second outbreak of severe illness began in 2012 in Saudi Arabia with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).	0
NewsClaims	4742	On December 31 of last year, Chinese authorities alerted the World Health Organization of an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus causing severe illness, which was subsequently named SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	4743	As of February 20, 2020, nearly 167,500 COVID-19 cases have been documented, although many more mild cases have likely gone undiagnosed.	0
NewsClaims	4744	The virus has killed over 6,600 people.	0
NewsClaims	4745	Shortly after the epidemic began, Chinese scientists sequenced the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and made the data available to researchers worldwide.	0
NewsClaims	4746	Andersen and collaborators at several other research institutions used this sequencing data to explore the origins and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 by focusing in on several tell-tale features of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	4747	The scientists analyzed the genetic template for spike proteins, armatures on the outside of the virus that it uses to grab and penetrate the outer walls of human and animal cells.	0
NewsClaims	4748	More specifically, they focused on two important features of the spike protein: the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a kind of grappling hook that grips onto host cells, and the cleavage site, a molecular can opener that allows the virus to crack open and enter host cells.	0
NewsClaims	4749	Evidence for natural evolution	0
NewsClaims	4750	The scientists found that the RBD portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins had evolved to effectively target a molecular feature on the outside of human cells called ACE2, a receptor involved in regulating blood pressure.	0
NewsClaims	4751	This evidence for natural evolution was supported by data on SARS-CoV-2's backbone - its overall molecular structure.	0
NewsClaims	4752	If someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness.	0
NewsClaims	4753	But the scientists found that the SARS-CoV-2 backbone differed substantially from those of already known coronaviruses and mostly resembled related viruses found in bats and pangolins.	0
NewsClaims	4754	"Josie Golding, PhD, epidemics lead at UK-based Wellcome Trust, said the findings by Andersen and his colleagues are ""crucially important to bring an evidence-based view to the rumors that have been circulating about the origins of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19."""	0
NewsClaims	4755	Possible origins of the virus	0
NewsClaims	4756	Based on their genomic sequencing analysis, Andersen and his collaborators concluded that the most likely origins for SARS-CoV-2 followed one of two possible scenarios.	0
NewsClaims	4757	In one scenario, the virus evolved to its current pathogenic state through natural selection in a non-human host and then jumped to humans.	0
NewsClaims	4758	This is how previous coronavirus outbreaks have emerged, with humans contracting the virus after direct exposure to civets (SARS) and camels (MERS).	0
NewsClaims	4759	There are no documented cases of direct bat-human transmission, however, suggesting that an intermediate host was likely involved between bats and humans.	0
NewsClaims	4760	In this scenario, both of the distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2's spike protein--the RBD portion that binds to cells and the cleavage site that opens the virus up--would have evolved to their current state prior to entering humans.	0
NewsClaims	4761	In this case, the current epidemic would probably have emerged rapidly as soon as humans were infected, as the virus would have already evolved the features that make it pathogenic and able to spread between people.	0
NewsClaims	4762	In the other proposed scenario, a non-pathogenic version of the virus jumped from an animal host into humans and then evolved to its current pathogenic state within the human population.	0
NewsClaims	4763	For instance, some coronaviruses from pangolins, armadillo-like mammals found in Asia and Africa, have an RBD structure very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	4764	Then the other distinct spike protein characteristic of SARS-CoV-2, the cleavage site, could have evolved within a human host, possibly via limited undetected circulation in the human population prior to the beginning of the epidemic.	0
NewsClaims	4765	The researchers found that the SARS-CoV-2 cleavage site, appears similar to the cleavage sites of strains of bird flu that has been shown to transmit easily between people.	0
NewsClaims	4766	SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved such a virulent cleavage site in human cells and soon kicked off the current epidemic, as the coronavirus would possibly have become far more capable of spreading between people.	0
NewsClaims	4767	Study co-author Andrew Rambaut cautioned that it is difficult if not impossible to know at this point which of the scenarios is most likely.	0
NewsClaims	4768	If the SARS-CoV-2 entered humans in its current pathogenic form from an animal source, it raises the probability of future outbreaks, as the illness-causing strain of the virus could still be circulating in the animal population and might once again jump into humans.	0
NewsClaims	4769	The chances are lower of a non-pathogenic coronavirus entering the human population and then evolving properties similar to SARS-CoV-2.	0

NewsClaims	4796	Things are moving fast; by the time you read this, the situation may have changed (for the better, we hope).	0
NewsClaims	4797	So how are scientists thinking they'll fend off this tiny viral adversary?	0

NewsClaims	4802	Lock It Out	0
NewsClaims	4803	Each particle of the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, is studded with spikes, which allow it to attach itself to a human cell, poke a hole, and burrow inside.	0
NewsClaims	4804	Like the germ that caused the SARS epidemic in 2003, it sticks to a protein on human cells called ACE2, which is especially prevalent in the lungs and small intestine.	0
NewsClaims	4805	(SARS-CoV-2 is at least 10 times stickier than its cousin, which may account for its rapid spread.)	0
NewsClaims	4806	One way to stop the invader is to keep it from attaching in the first place.	0
NewsClaims	4807	This is what your immune system tries to do—it sends out antibodies that gum up the spikes so the virus can't stick to ACE2.	0
NewsClaims	4808	But there are other ways of achieving the same effect.	0
NewsClaims	4809	1.	0
NewsClaims	4810	Make a vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	4811	It contains a defanged version of the virus that your immune system can use for target practice—but it can also cause infection.	0
NewsClaims	4812	That's why many researchers are working on vaccines that contain not the whole virus but just the outer spikes.	0
NewsClaims	4813	Mixed with immune-boosting molecules called adjuvants, they'll elicit a safe antibody response.	0
NewsClaims	4814	2.	0
NewsClaims	4815	Take antibody-rich blood plasma from people who have survived Covid-19 and inject it into newly infected or at-risk patients.	0
NewsClaims	4816	Plasma won't teach the body how to fend off the virus, and one injection won't last forever—but it could be a good way to prepare health workers before they head to a hot spot.	0
NewsClaims	4817	3.	0
NewsClaims	4818	Flood the zone with decoys—synthetic molecules that look like ACE2 and trick the virus into binding with them instead, protecting lung cells from damage.	0
NewsClaims	4819	4.	0
NewsClaims	4820	Invent drugs that hinder ACE2 from binding with the virus.	0
NewsClaims	4821	In theory, these compounds would work on both SARS and Covid-19, stopping the viruses from sticking to cells.	0
NewsClaims	4822	But ACE2 plays a number of other roles throughout the body; it helps regulate blood pressure, kidney function, and even fertility.	0
NewsClaims	4823	Messing with it could have dangerous consequences.	0

NewsClaims	4825	All viruses wear heavy-duty protein coats to protect their precious genetic material from the elements.	0

NewsClaims	4841	Proteases are like molecular scissors; once inside the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 uses them to slice long strands of protein into usable chunks.	0

NewsClaims	4848	Updated April 7, 2020	0
NewsClaims	4849	There is a lot of information circulating about COVID-19 and it is important for people to be educated about the virus and how to help keep it from spreading.	0
NewsClaims	4850	But with so much information available there also comes misinformation.	0
NewsClaims	4851	Which is why we turned to our medical experts to set the record straight by dispelling some of the common myths.	0
NewsClaims	4852	People with COVID-19 may not show signs of infection for many days.	0
NewsClaims	4853	TRUE.	0
NewsClaims	4854	The following symptoms may develop 2-14 days after exposure: fever (77-98%), cough (46-88%), or shortness of breath (3-31%).	0
NewsClaims	4855	Most people (75%) develop symptoms by 7 days following exposure.	0
NewsClaims	4856	Most people have mild symptoms and do not require care from a medical provider and should stay home until well.	0
NewsClaims	4857	Patients with more serious symptoms, like shortness of breath, should call their medical provider.	0
NewsClaims	4858	I have heard that if you can take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds without coughing, discomfort, or tightness, etc., it basically indicates no infection.	0
NewsClaims	4859	In critical time, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air.	0
NewsClaims	4860	FALSE.	0
NewsClaims	4861	Most patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, like the common cold.	0
NewsClaims	4862	The ability to hold your breath for more than 10 seconds without cough, etc.	0
NewsClaims	4863	is not helpful in determining whether someone has infection or not.	0
NewsClaims	4864	People with mild symptoms do not need to be tested and should stay home until well.	0
NewsClaims	4865	Taking a few sips of water every 15 minutes will prevent infection from COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4866	FALSE.	0
NewsClaims	4867	While drinking enough water to stay hydrated is important, drinking sips of water every 15 minutes does not prevent infection from COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4868	Social distancing (maintaining 6 feet) from other people, frequent hand washing and avoiding touching your face will help to prevent infection with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4869	You should also gargle as a prevention.	0
NewsClaims	4870	A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice.	0
NewsClaims	4871	FALSE.	0
NewsClaims	4872	Sore throat is a less common symptom of COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4873	Gargling with saltwater may help make your throat feel better but does not prevent infection or make it go away more quickly.	0
NewsClaims	4874	Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses.	0
NewsClaims	4875	Try not to drink liquids with ice.	0
NewsClaims	4876	FALSE.	0
NewsClaims	4877	Drinking water is important to stay healthy, as is eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables and getting enough rest.	0
NewsClaims	4878	Drinking warm or hot liquids may soothe your throat and help a cough, but they do not prevent infection from COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4879	COVID-19 lasts on metal surfaces or fabric for 6-12 hours.	0
NewsClaims	4880	PARTLY TRUE.	0
NewsClaims	4881	Currently it appears that COVID-19 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials.	0
NewsClaims	4882	However, most transmission occurs from close contact or droplet transmission.	0
NewsClaims	4883	Transmission of COVID-19 from a contaminated surface has not been documented.	0
NewsClaims	4884	Cleaning and disinfecting high touch surfaces (e.g.	0
NewsClaims	4885	light switches, tables, doorknobs, phones) is important.	0
NewsClaims	4886	Alcohol solutions of at least 70% or 1/3 cup bleach in 1 gallon of water should be used to clean surfaces.	0
NewsClaims	4887	Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand rub containing more than 60% alcohol.	0
NewsClaims	4888	Please see CDC website for further information.	0
NewsClaims	4889	Taking vitamin C will prevent COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4890	FALSE.	0
NewsClaims	4891	While vitamins are important for our health, excessive vitamin C does not help to prevent COVID-19, and it can cause some side effects like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, stomach cramps, headache, or insomnia.	0
NewsClaims	4892	If someone with COVID-19 sneezes it stays in the air for 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.	0
NewsClaims	4893	FALSE.	0
NewsClaims	4894	COVID-19 is transmitted by being within 6 feet of someone with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time (more than 10 minutes).	0
NewsClaims	4895	Close contact can occur while living with, caring for, visiting or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a person with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4896	Having direct contact with secretions from a person with COVID-19 (e.g.	0
NewsClaims	4897	cough or sneeze) can also transmit infection.	0
NewsClaims	4898	COVID-19 was made in a laboratory.	0
NewsClaims	4899	FALSE.	0
NewsClaims	4900	Scientists are still investigating the origin of COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4901	Please see this website for more information on COVID-19 myths.	0
NewsClaims	4902	We promise.	0
NewsClaims	4903	With the coronavirus pandemic continuing to spread around the globe, people are panicked, and they're looking for answers and explanations.	0

NewsClaims	4907	In the past, Wickramasinghe has asserted that another disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) also came from space.	0
NewsClaims	4908	"He even co-wrote a book with Fred Hoyle in the 1970s called ""Diseases from Space"" and, for decades, has tried to prove that diseases like SARS or influenza have come from space."	0
NewsClaims	4909	"It would be unprecedented to discover that a virus could survive the radiation it would be exposed to on such a long journey through space (never mind the trip back to Earth) and still be able to infect humans after it landed, astrobiologist Graham Lau, who hosts NASA's ""Ask an Astrobiologist"" series, told Space.com."	0
NewsClaims	4910	However, while it would be an incredibly unique and groundbreaking finding if this were true, Wickramasinghe simply does not have evidence to support his claims, Lau said.	0
NewsClaims	4911	"""It's one of those cases where extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,"" Lau told Space.com."	0
NewsClaims	4912	"""Even though it's an interesting idea, we just don't have any reason to embrace that idea right now."	0
NewsClaims	4913	"""I think it's important for scientists to point out pseudoscientists or bad science,"" Lau added."	0
NewsClaims	4914	"""If this was real, it'd be great, but we just can't allow ourselves to jump to the feel-good conclusion without doing our due diligence as scientists."""	0
NewsClaims	4915	More: Coronavirus outbreak shakes space industry: Here's the effects so far	0
NewsClaims	4916	Additionally, from what we know about the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, it lines up with what we know about terrestrial viruses.	0
NewsClaims	4917	The virus is responsible for the disease COVID-19, which has infected more than 187,000 people globally, according to the New York Times.	0
NewsClaims	4918	"""If this thing had some different kind of biomolecule in it that's different from life as we know it,"" Lau said, then there might be reason to investigate whether the virus had extraterrestrial origins."	0
NewsClaims	4919	However, even in that case, there could be Earthly explanations, he added.	0
NewsClaims	4920	Wickramasinghe's claim ties into the theory of panspermia, a longstanding but not proven theory which poses that life on Earth originated with help from microorganisms and biological material from outer space, Lau said.	0
NewsClaims	4921	And while there is not yet concrete evidence that panspermia has occurred here on Earth or is even possible, theoretically, it could happen, he said.	0
NewsClaims	4922	Theoretically, biological materials could survive on a space rock, lie dormant and continue to survive if they were properly shielded from the radiation in space and survive the process of impacting Earth, Lau said, noting that scientists have found organic molecules such as amino acids inside meteorites.	0
NewsClaims	4923	The UK-led campaign cites a review of 100+ vitamin C trials​​ just published in Nutrients​ – some of which are specific to COVID-19; some specific to sepsis and broader respiratory issues – to back its case.	0
NewsClaims	4924	Lead author of that review and VitaminC4Covid campaign director, Patrick Holford, told NutraIngredients vitamin C data was as strong as that which existed for vitamin D and had the potential to reduce COVID-19 symptoms at low cost and “​suppress viral replication in the early stages”.​	0
NewsClaims	4925	“The critical phase of COVID-19 is a direct result of an inflammatory reaction by the body’s immune system, akin to sepsis, that only occurs if there is a large quantity of dead virus particles,”​ said Holford, who is the founder of the Food for the Brain Foundation and has written 45 nutrition-focused books.	0
NewsClaims	4926	“Early suppression and rapid resolution of symptoms, as shown in cold studies giving 4 to 8 grams of vitamin C in the first 24 hours of infection, has the potential to stop conversion to critical COVID, ​thus taking the pressure off the National Health Service.”​	0
NewsClaims	4927	The Nutrients​ review has been presented to the British Health Minister Matt Hancock as well as the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) and the National Institute for Clinical Evidence (NICE).	0
NewsClaims	4928	Vitamin C data and deficiencies​	0
NewsClaims	4929	Holford said a key campaign focus was raising vitamin C levels in the elderly, for whom a disproportionate percentage are simultaneously affected by COVID-19 and vitamin C deficient.	0
NewsClaims	4930	The campaign seeks £10,000 (€11,000) as a minimum to screen vitamin C levels in Welsh care home residents and £200,000 (€221,000) for a definitive vitamin C and colds trial which, if started during the pandemic would also indicate the protective effect of vitamin C in those with colds that test covid positive.	0
NewsClaims	4931	“The irony is that Zhongnan Hospital ran out of COVID patients by the end of April as a consequence of the Chinese government shipping in 50 tons – 50 million 1g doses - into Wuhan on February 2nd and distributing to all hospitals which not only gave hospitalised patients high doses of vitamin C, intravenously in ICUs, but also gave daily vitamin C to all hospital workers,”​ Holford said.	0
NewsClaims	4932	Professor David Smith from Oxford University’s Department of Pharmacology and VitaminC4Covid Scientific Advisory Board Member, said evidence was mounting “that vitamin C treatment may be beneficial.” ​	0
NewsClaims	4933	Professor Smith added: “…There are some 30 trials in progress testing the therapeutic benefit of high dose vitamin C in late stage Covid-19.”​	0
NewsClaims	4934	Rob Verkerk PhD, founder, executive and scientific director at the Alliance for Natural Health (ANH) went further, stating, “​doctors and other health professionals who avoid recommendations on vitamin C in relation to COVID disease prevention and treatment, should be considered medically negligent.”​	0
NewsClaims	4935	‘We’ve had 11 viral epidemics this century​​’​	0
NewsClaims	4936	Holford called on food supplement trade groups to back the campaign.	0
NewsClaims	4937	“​​We badly need to support to carry out further studies.”​	0
NewsClaims	4938	Graham Keen, executive director of the UK’s Health Food Manufacturers’ Association (HFMA), said the campaign was being discussed by HFMA Council today.	0
NewsClaims	4939	The current World Health Organisation (WHO) position on supplementation states: “Micronutrients, such as vitamins D and C and zinc, are critical for a well-functioning immune system and play a vital role in promoting health and nutritional well-being.	0
NewsClaims	4940	There is currently no guidance on the use of micronutrient supplements as a treatment of COVID-19.”​	0
NewsClaims	4941	Holford, who in 1984 established the Institute for Optimum Nutrition​​ with Nobel Prize-winning vitamin C researcher Linus Pauling, said the campaign went beyond vitamin C or even the coronavirus pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	4942	“I hope, within a year, governments and health authorities will have incorporated vitamin C into prevention, early treatment and hospital treatment, not only for COVID-19 but any future viral pandemic.​	0
NewsClaims	4943	“We’ve had 11 viral epidemics this century.	0
NewsClaims	4944	The reality is there will be more.	0
NewsClaims	4945	Keeping one’s immune system strong is a critical part of any anti-viral strategy.”​	0
NewsClaims	4946	In fact, there's a lot of research looking at vitamin C to help prevent the common cold and it has shown to not be effective.	0
NewsClaims	4947	There is a small study looking at high doses of vitamin C either by mouth of IV (intravenous).	0
NewsClaims	4948	In that study, high-dose vitamin C appeared to decrease the time on a ventilator for seriously ill people with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4949	More research is underway to better understand how we might use IV vitamin C to help treat COVID-19.	0

NewsClaims	4954	At the time, many politicians across the political spectrum, including on the left, were pushing similar messages, encouraging residents to go for aperitivos.	0
NewsClaims	4955	Then came the lockdown.	0
NewsClaims	4956	Salvini pivoted.	0
NewsClaims	4957	His new attack line: the lockdowns don’t go far enough.	0
NewsClaims	4958	#chiuderetutto — shut everything down — his social media headers read.	0
NewsClaims	4959	Inevitably, as lifelong eurosceptics, Salvini and Meloni began attacking the EU’s response to the crisis, even arguing, without evidence, that some member states wanted to exploit the pandemic to their benefit.	0
NewsClaims	4960	But with attention still running thin, the attacks have become relentless — and the content posted by Salvini and Meloni increasingly extreme.	0
NewsClaims	4961	On Wednesday, the two leaders took a conspiracy theory doing the rounds in some WhatsApp groups and pushed it to their millions of followers on Facebook and Twitter.	0
NewsClaims	4962	"""INCREDIBLE!!!"""	0
NewsClaims	4963	"""WE WANT THE TRUTH!"""	0
NewsClaims	4964	Meloni said on the social networking platform.	0
NewsClaims	4965	Both leaders called for the government to answer questions in parliament.	0
NewsClaims	4966	The conspiracy theory has been debunked by Italian fact-checkers and several news outlets, including Il Post and La Repubblica.	0
NewsClaims	4967	In short, the 2015 research had nothing to do with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4968	"Therefore it [COVID-19] absolutely cannot be the virus created in the Chinese lab that is discussed in the [2015] programme."""	0
NewsClaims	4969	President Joe Biden has ordered US intelligence agencies to conduct a 90-day review of what is known about the origins of Covid-19 and whether it could have escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan.	0
NewsClaims	4970	So what does this mean for the lab leak theory?	0
NewsClaims	4971	Has new evidence emerged?	0
NewsClaims	4972	Despite the Biden announcement and various stories in the US media claiming support is growing for the Wuhan lab leak theory, the answer is that surprisingly little has changed in terms of good quality evidence – at least in the public domain.	0
NewsClaims	4973	How reliable is the evidence?	0
NewsClaims	4974	The intelligence relating to the three staff at the WIV has been described as uncorroborated evidence from a foreign source, ie it was not obtained – or so far verified – by a US intelligence agency, and was initially looked at under the Trump administration.	0
NewsClaims	4975	“It was very precise,” one source told the WSJ, but added the crucial caveat: “What it didn’t tell you was exactly why they got sick.”	0
NewsClaims	4976	According to the New York Times, not one but two intelligence documents were produced discussing the sick workers, one focused on the three individuals, the second about what was known about the origins of the coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	4977	There are multiple issues, however, with how to interpret this information.	0
NewsClaims	4978	Questions include whether the symptoms seen were of coronavirus or bad flu (or something else) and whether the sickness – if it was coronavirus – was related to work in their lab, or simply suggests that Covid-19 was circulating in the general population in Wuhan a few weeks earlier than assumed.	0
NewsClaims	4979	Biden’s comments, launching the review, are revealing – not least when he said that the US intelligence community does “not believe there is sufficient information” to fully understand the likelihood of different scenarios for explaining the origin of the virus that causes Covid-19.	0
NewsClaims	4980	So where are we with the animal host theory?	0
NewsClaims	4981	Much has been made by some of the fact that no intermediate animal host – between humans and bats – has so far been identified, which has been cited in some places as somehow supporting the lab leak theory.	0
NewsClaims	4982	The reality is that identifying animal hosts in past coronavirus outbreaks has been a lengthy and uncertain process.	0
NewsClaims	4983	While it is known that dromedaries were a major reservoir host for Mers, even now the role of the animals in transmitting the virus is poorly understood.	0
NewsClaims	4984	The same was true with the Sars outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	4985	While civet cats were suspected as intermediate hosts, it took years to confirm.	0
NewsClaims	4986	In neither case was there was a suggestion of a lab leak.	0
NewsClaims	4987	Because of that, the model of transmission via an intermediate host has remained the predominant one under consideration.	0
NewsClaims	4988	Another issue is that a lot of focus of research into the origins of Covid-19 so far has relied on the very specialised field of the interpretation of gene sequences of the virus, an area that is less accessible to non-experts including journalists.	0
NewsClaims	4989	But wasn’t there a World Health Organization mission to Wuhan to study the origins of Covid-19?	0
NewsClaims	4990	There was indeed.	0
NewsClaims	4991	But the terms of reference of that mission, agreed with China, were to study the potential animal origins of the coronavirus, a fact that was well known to the US and other countries.	0
NewsClaims	4992	It did not include provisions for an audit of the WIV laboratory or to look into so-called “gain of function” research at the lab into viruses, which the Chinese are unlikely to have agreed to.	0
NewsClaims	4993	During that mission to Wuhan, researchers spent just three hours at the lab.	0
NewsClaims	4994	However, in public comments team members were sceptical of the lab leak theory after their visit, on the basis of what they were allowed to see – although that does not rule other material having been hidden.	0
NewsClaims	4995	And China, as the WHO’s head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, made clear, did not provide all the information that many had been hoping for, including full epidemiological data on some 174 early cases.	0
NewsClaims	4996	Why has the lab leak theory come back now?	0
NewsClaims	4997	That’s complicated.	0
NewsClaims	4998	The overt hostility of the Trump administration to China, and the way it pushed the lab leak claims, including a dodgy dossier that was doing the rounds last year, made it a pretty tainted source.	0
NewsClaims	4999	The advent of a Biden administration, which is less hostile to China, combined with the limitations in the WHO investigation, created an environment where some have felt able to ask questions about Covid-19’s origins without appearing to buy into Trump-era conspiracies.	0
NewsClaims	5000	However, like the Benghazi attack in 2012, the Wuhan lab leak theory remains something of a cause celebre for the US right in the midst of what is essentially a cold war between the US and China.	0
NewsClaims	5001	In particular, it has been seen as a stick to beat the Biden administration’s handling of it, not least following the decision to close down a state dDepartment group that had been looking into the lab leak theory.	0
NewsClaims	5002	That effort, first reported by CNN, was quietly launched by the then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, last autumn and reportedly became quickly mired in concern that it was part of a politicised effort by the Trump administration to blame China and cherry-pick facts to prove a theory.	0
NewsClaims	5003	Indeed, one source quoted by CNN was highly critical of the work being done.	0
NewsClaims	5004	“They basically conducted it in secret, cutting out the state department’s technical experts and the intelligence community, and then trying to brief certain senior officials in the interagency on their ‘tentative conclusions’ even before they’d let the department leaders they worked for know an investigation was under way at all.”	0
NewsClaims	5005	That sounds familiar …	0
NewsClaims	5006	It does indeed.	0
NewsClaims	5007	Many aspects of Wuhan lab leak story have echoes of the search for WMD in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003 which included efforts to “stove pipe” intelligence analysis to fit the operating theory.	0
NewsClaims	5008	Then as now, experts (then weapons inspectors also under the aegis of a UN body) were sent into a highly obstructive environment amid a highly politicised debate.	0
NewsClaims	5009	Leaks of dubious intelligence – some of it provided by third party countries like the infamous Curveball claims – were reported without sufficient scepticism and expert warnings sidelined.	0
NewsClaims	5010	So has the lab leak theory become more credible or not?	0
NewsClaims	5011	The bottom line is that it is still impossible to know with any certainty, as Biden has said.	0
NewsClaims	5012	Lab accidents do happen all the time, meaning that without further evidence a lab leak remains a possibility.	0
NewsClaims	5013	Chinese obstruction of research into Covid-19’s origins, combined with its own promotion of conspiracy theories over a foreign origin of the disease, make it look like it has something sinister to hide.	0
NewsClaims	5014	As the experience of the Iraq weapons inspectors demonstrated, obstruction can be profoundly misunderstood as suggesting a motive: ie Saddam Hussein was not hiding WMD but had substantially disarmed.	0
NewsClaims	5015	And where we are today, as Adam Taylor put it cleverly in the Washington Post on Thursday, is nowhere close to a resolution.	0
NewsClaims	5016	“Although the resurgent chatter may suggest new clues or proof, the inverse is in fact true.	0
NewsClaims	5017	It is the persistent absence of any convincing evidence either for or against the theory that has prompted calls for more investigation.”	0

NewsClaims	5023	Stories and information can spread like wildfire on social media -- go viral -- especially false information.	0
NewsClaims	5024	WCVB is experiencing that phenomenon first-hand as we find one of our stories in the middle of a growing COVID-19 conspiracy online – a story that has been taken out of context and stamped with inaccurate and misleading headlines.	0
NewsClaims	5025	In the attempt to legitimize those claims, the posts are pointing to a WCVB story from January.	0
NewsClaims	5026	But the claims are not true, and the story never made any of them.	0
NewsClaims	5027	Some of the false claims have been translated into multiple languages and are circulating around the world.	0

NewsClaims	5032	Those words were spoken by Andrew Lelling, U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, on Jan.	0
NewsClaims	5033	28.	0
NewsClaims	5034	They are now being used to fuel the conspiracy and misconceptions.	0
NewsClaims	5035	Lelling was speaking at a news conference regarding the arrest of Dr. Lieber, the chairman of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University.	0
NewsClaims	5036	"Dr. Lieber, of Lexington, Mass., is charged with ""Making false statements to the agency of the United States Government,"" or lying to federal authorities about his ties to China."	0
NewsClaims	5037	According to court documents, Dr. Lieber was the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University.	0
NewsClaims	5038	Since 2008, the group had received more than $15 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense.	0
NewsClaims	5039	However, prosecutors allege that on applications with the NIH and DoD, Dr. Lieber did not disclose that he was being paid a salary of up to $50,000 per month and up to $158,000 per year in living expenses by China's Thousand Talents Plan and the Wuhan University of Technology.	0
NewsClaims	5040	The complaint alleges that Dr. Lieber worked with the University for significant periods between at least 2012 and 2017.	0
NewsClaims	5041	Federal investigators also determined that Dr. Lieber was awarded more than $1.5 million to establish a nanotechnology research lab at WUT.	0

NewsClaims	5080	Charles Lieber	0
NewsClaims	5081	The EUvsDisinfo database has been accumulating coronavirus-related disinformation cases for more than two months – it’s time to take a look and see what’s hiding in plain sight.	0
NewsClaims	5082	Comparing the cases on the coronavirus published between January 22 and March 25 with the caseload from this week alone, it appears that the anti-American vibe is still going strong.	0
NewsClaims	5083	The second most common narrative is that the EU is failing to cope with the crisis and is disintegrating as a result, together with the border-free Schengen area.	0
NewsClaims	5084	In particular, this narrative of failure and lack of EU solidarity is trending after the delivery of Russian aid to Italy – we have added 26 new disinformation cases to the database.	0
NewsClaims	5085	The narrative that the virus is being used as a weapon against China and its economy comes in third place with 24 cases.	0
NewsClaims	5086	And in fourth place is the rather creative notion that the whole coronavirus crisis is a secret plan of the global elite, with 17 cases and counting.	0
NewsClaims	5087	Rounding out our top five is a group of messages targeting Ukraine in the context of the coronavirus crisis, with the pro-Kremlin media successfully managing to mix in accusations of Nazism.	0
NewsClaims	5088	Total cases: 13.	0
NewsClaims	5089	Do the most common narratives also mean most engagement?	0
NewsClaims	5090	In order to answer this question, we looked at the 152 cases collected between January 22 and March 25, which have had more time to age on social media and generate likes, shares, and comments.	0
NewsClaims	5091	We derived 442 URLs and analysed them using BuzzSumo.	0
NewsClaims	5092	Then we linked the most popular URLs with cases to see which of the narratives have struck a chord with the public.	0
NewsClaims	5093	Check out the ten most popular disinformation messages below.	0
NewsClaims	5094	If 68,700 likes, shares, and comments across different social media platforms doesn’t seem like much, the 263,902 engagements for all those 152 coronavirus-related disinformation articles looks somewhat more worrying.	0
NewsClaims	5095	Especially since this is a topic where disinformation can bring life-threatening consequences.	0
NewsClaims	5096	But it’s also important to lighten the mood occasionally in these challenging times, and here the pro-Kremlin disinformation machine never fails.	0
NewsClaims	5097	Here were this week’s funniest cases:	0
NewsClaims	5098	– 380 Belgians caught COVID-19 through a massive act of group sex	0
NewsClaims	5099	– the cause for the spread of the coronavirus epidemic is the legalisation of gay marriage	0

NewsClaims	5104	Pentagon Study: Flu Shot Raises Risk of Coronavirus by 36% (and Other Supporting Studies)	0
NewsClaims	5105	Setting safety and efficacy of influenza vaccination aside, is Anderson’s claim that the flu shot will help people fight COVID-19 remotely true?	0
NewsClaims	5106	The short answer is no.	0
NewsClaims	5107	In fact, the results of many peer-reviewed, published studies prove that Anderson’s recommendation may have been the worst advice he could have given the public.	0
NewsClaims	5108	“Receiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as “virus interference…’vaccine derived’ virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus…” Here are the findings:	0
NewsClaims	5109	2020 Pentagon study: Flu vaccines increase risk of coronavirus by 36%	0
NewsClaims	5110	Examining non-influenza viruses specifically, the odds of coronavirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals with an odds ratio (association between an exposure and an outcome) of 1.36.	0
NewsClaims	5111	In other words, the vaccinated were 36% more likely to get coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	5112	Many other studies suggest the increased risk of viral respiratory infections from the flu shot:	0
NewsClaims	5113	2018 CDC Study: Flu shots increase risk of non-flu acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) in children.	0
NewsClaims	5114	This CDC supported study concluded an increased risk of acute respiratory illness (ARI) among children <18 years caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens post-influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period.	0
NewsClaims	5115	2011 Australian Study: Flu shot doubled risk of non-influenza viral infections and increased flu risk by 73%.	0
NewsClaims	5116	A prospective case-control study in healthy young Australian children found that seasonal flu shots doubled their risk of illness from non-influenza virus infections.	0
NewsClaims	5117	Overall, the vaccine increased the risk of virus-associated acute respiratory illness, including influenza, by 73%.	0
NewsClaims	5118	2012 Hong Kong Study: Flu shots increased the risk of non-flu respiratory infections 4.4 times and tripled flu infections.	0
NewsClaims	5119	A randomized placebo-controlled trial in Hong Kong children found that flu shots increased the risk of non-influenza viral ARIs fivefold (OR 4.91,CI 1.04—8.14) and, including influenza, tripled the overall viral ARI risk (OR 3.17, CI 1.04—9.83).	0
NewsClaims	5120	2017 Study: Vaccinated children are 5.9 more likely to suffer pneumonia and 30.1 times more likely to have been diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis than unvaccinated children.	0
NewsClaims	5121	Vaccinated children were 30.1 times more likely to have been diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis and 5.9 times more likely to have been diagnosed with pneumonia than unvaccinated children.	0
NewsClaims	5122	2014 Study: Influenza-vaccinated children were 1.6 times more likely than unvaccinated children to have a non-influenza “Influenza-like-illness” (ILI).	0
NewsClaims	5123	Even more published science	0
NewsClaims	5124	The well-respected Cochrane Collaboration’s comprehensive 2010 meta-analysis of published influenza vaccine studies found that the influenza vaccination has “no effect” on hospitalization, and that there is “no evidence that vaccines prevent viral transmission or complications.” The Cochrane Researchers concluded that the scientific evidence “seem[s] to discourage the utilization of vaccination against influenza in healthy adults as a routine public health measure.”	0
NewsClaims	5125	In their meta-analysis, the Cochrane researchers accused the CDC of deliberately misrepresenting the science in order to support their universal influenza vaccination recommendation.	0
NewsClaims	5126	Nevertheless, CNN and other mainstream media outlets continually broadcast CDC pronouncements as gospel and, ironically, ridicules those of us who actually read the science as “purveyors of ‘vaccine misinformation”.	0
NewsClaims	5127	Coronavirus or West Nile?	0
NewsClaims	5128	CDC reports 17 cases of mosquito disease that present symptoms similarly to COVID-19	0
NewsClaims	5129	West Nile virus is transmitted primarily by several Culex species, including Culex salinarius and Culex pipiens, health officials say.	0
NewsClaims	5130	(iStock)	0
NewsClaims	5131	While the United States deals with the coronavirus, the West Nile virus is on the rise and can show similar features to COVID-19, creating some confusion.	0
NewsClaims	5132	Seventeen human cases of West Nile virus have been reported so far in Texas, Los Angeles County, and Fla., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).	0
NewsClaims	5133	In Georgia, Fox 5 Atlanta reported this week that mosquitos positive for West Nile Virus were found in DeKalb County.	0
NewsClaims	5134	Because the symptoms are similar to COVID-19, which is still running rampant throughout the country, health experts warn to not overlook West Nile when diagnosing.	0

"""	0
NewsClaims	5138	"The professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine also told the media outlet: ""They can have headache, fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal symptoms [vomiting and diarrhea], and swollen lymph glands."""	0
NewsClaims	5139	"Auwaerter said in the article with the diseases sharing similar characteristics, ""People are just assuming they have COVID-19,"" rather than a mosquito bearing disease."	0
NewsClaims	5140	"""Statistically, it’s probably true that it’s COVID in these cases,"" the article cited Auwaerter, ""But it’s not always the case."""	0
NewsClaims	5141	Health officials at Cleveland clinic, according to the media outlet, stated a skin rash on the trunk and chest, can occur with the West Nile virus while it is not as typical with COVID-19 patients who, if they do present with a rash, typically report it on their toes.	0
NewsClaims	5142	"Both diseases can have detrimental effects on a person’s health and can affect the nervous system, according to the CDC, which also states on its website that nearly ""1 in every 150 people who are infected with West Nile disease can develop a severe illness affecting the central nervous system"" such as encephalitis (brain inflammation) or meningitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord)."	0
NewsClaims	5143	Doctors told Fox News, in some cases of West Nile infections, patients can show symptoms including high fever, stiff neck, severe headache, and can even become confused, weak and experience possible seizures.	0

NewsClaims	5145	The novel coronavirus can also show neurological effects.	0
NewsClaims	5146	"Some cases reported peripheral neuropathy in the legs and complaints of ""brain fog,"" some physicians explained to Fox News."	0
NewsClaims	5147	COVID-19 can also affect the trigeminal and olfactory nerves which affect the sense of smell.	0
NewsClaims	5148	which is not typical with the West Nile infection.	0
NewsClaims	5149	Besides those symptoms, neurologists told Fox News that coronavirus can present with headache, difficulty focusing, blood clotting, weakness and some studies are linking it with the neurological condition Guillain-barre.	0
NewsClaims	5150	One main difference, according to health experts, is that the coronavirus is a contagious respiratory disease where West Nile is not.	0
NewsClaims	5151	The West Nile illness is contracted typically by a mosquito bite, while novel coronavirus is currently believed to spread through sneezing, coughing or touching, according to the CDC.	0
NewsClaims	5152	To differentiate clinically between the two illnesses, a physician can perform a nasal swab test to detect novel coronavirus while a blood test can determine if a person has been infected with the West Nile virus infection.	0

NewsClaims	5160	High-profile coronavirus retractions raise concerns about data oversight	0
NewsClaims	5161	'.	0
NewsClaims	5162	Researchers say the advice is premature and risky, because there is limited evidence that the drug, hydroxychloroquine, works against the new coronavirus, and there are a growing number of reports that it can trigger serious side effects.	0
NewsClaims	5163	There is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, so the prospect of a widely available drug such as hydroxychloroquine — and a similar compound, chloroquine — reducing infection risk is appealing, especially in parts of India where high population density makes social distancing difficult.	0
NewsClaims	5164	Many people around the world, including US President Donald Trump, have taken the drug in the hope it might prevent infection.	0
NewsClaims	5165	But, at this stage, there is almost no evidence that the drug works in this way, and the results of several randomized and placebo-controlled prophylaxis trials under way in the United States, Europe and South Asia have not been published.	0
NewsClaims	5166	Coronavirus and COVID-19: Keep up to date	0
NewsClaims	5167	So far, almost all the data on the drug’s safety and efficacy come from studies that tested hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.	0

NewsClaims	5171	that reportedly looked at 96,000 people with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	5172	It reported that the drug offered no treatment benefit, and that people who took it were more likely to die than those who didn’t	0
NewsClaims	5173	1	0
NewsClaims	5174	.	0
NewsClaims	5175	Scientists have since raised serious concerns about the study's data and analysis, given that few other studies have linked hydroxychloroquine with a high mortality rate.	0
NewsClaims	5176	Today, the journal issued an Expression of Concern, and noted that an independent audit of the data has been commissioned.	0
NewsClaims	5177	But the findings had already prompted health regulators in several countries, and the World Health Organization, to pause enrolment in trials of the drug last week.	0
NewsClaims	5178	The situation with the drug is far from clear-cut.	0
NewsClaims	5179	The	0
NewsClaims	5180	Lancet	0
NewsClaims	5181	study isn’t the first to document the drug’s adverse effects.	0
NewsClaims	5182	Several randomized and observational studies of the drug published in the past two months have also found adverse effects, including diarrhoea and heart-rhythm abnormalities, while reporting conflicting results about the drug’s efficacy.	0
NewsClaims	5183	Recommendation extended	0
NewsClaims	5184	Despite the lack of clear evidence that the drug is safe or protects people from coronavirus infection, on 22 May an Indian health ministry task force released the advice for front-line workers, including the police and people conducting door-to-door surveys to estimate the COVID-19 burden to take hydroxychloroquine to prevent infection.	0
NewsClaims	5185	The advice expands on a similar recommendation, made in March, in which the task force said that health-care workers caring for people with COVID-19, and household contacts of people with confirmed COVID-19, should also take the drug.	0
NewsClaims	5186	Dozens of coronavirus drugs are in development — what happens next?	0
NewsClaims	5187	Only one of these studies has been published, on 31 May	0
NewsClaims	5188	2	0
NewsClaims	5189	, which compared people with the disease to those without it, known as a case-controlled study.Scientists at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) looked at whether more than 300 health-care workers who had caught the virus were more or less likely to have taken hydroxychloroquine than a similar number of health-care workers who hadn’t caught the virus.	0
NewsClaims	5190	The study found that those who caught the virus were less likely to have taken the drug.	0
NewsClaims	5191	But several scientists say these findings don’t mean much.	0
NewsClaims	5192	Only a randomized controlled trial, in which people are randomly chosen to take the drug or the placebo, and followed up to determine their risk of acquiring the disease, can answer this question, he says.	0
NewsClaims	5193	At best, the study’s findings justify further research, but they aren’t strong enough to support the government’s recommendation, says Sahaj Rathi, a New-Delhi-based transplant hepatologist.	0
NewsClaims	5194	"""I was looking for evidence to justify the advisory, but I don’t see that,"" he says."	0
NewsClaims	5195	Samiran Panda, the director of the ICMR’s National AIDS Research Institute in Pune and the lead author of the study, says the trial was designed to investigate the drug’s public-health relevance, and not to find conclusive evidence of its efficacy.	0
NewsClaims	5196	The head of the ICMR, Balram Bhargava, who is based in New Delhi, has said previously that it would have been unethical to do such a study and deny some people the drug, given that it could be beneficial.	0
NewsClaims	5197	Safety concerns	0
NewsClaims	5198	But a randomized trial is also important to assess a drug’s safety, particularly if a medicine is being recommended to healthy people to prevent infection, rather than to treat a disease, says Rathi.	0
NewsClaims	5199	"""Here we are giving a medicine, which carries a small but known risk of side effects, to healthy people."""	0
NewsClaims	5200	The ICMR says it does have some safety data, from an unpublished observational study of 1,323 health-care workers who took the drug prophylactically.	0
NewsClaims	5201	The agency reports that 1.7% of people experienced hypoglycaemia and 1.9% had cardiovascular effects.	0
NewsClaims	5202	"It concludes that the drug is ""relatively safe""."	0
NewsClaims	5203	How countries are using genomics to help avoid a second coronavirus wave	0
NewsClaims	5204	But scientists question this assessment.	0
NewsClaims	5205	A roughly 2% rate of cardiovascular side effects or hypoglycaemia is high for a drug when there is a lack of rigorous evidence that it works, says Shriprakash Kalantri, an internal-medicine specialist at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in the Indian state of Maharashtra.	0
NewsClaims	5206	Bhargava told	0
NewsClaims	5207	Nature	0
NewsClaims	5208	that the task force behind the government’s latest advisory did consider the drug’s side effects.	0
NewsClaims	5209	The government recommends that people taking hydroxychloroquine get an electrocardiogram at some point during the weeks-long drug regimen to check for any heart-rhythm abnormalities.	0
NewsClaims	5210	Big consequences	0
NewsClaims	5211	Doctors worry that the government’s latest advice will create an overly optimistic perception of the drug, given the environment of panic surrounding the virus.	0
NewsClaims	5212	When the ICMR started recommending the drug in March, doctors warned that this would trigger indiscriminate hydroxychloroquine use.	0
NewsClaims	5213	Those concerns have largely been borne out.	0
NewsClaims	5214	In Mumbai, health authorities initially prescribed the drug to children, contrary to the ICMR’s advice, and considered a plan to give the drug to people under 55 years old in COVID-19 hotspots, such as Mumbai’s Dharavi — one of Asia’s most densely populated slums.	0
NewsClaims	5215	This plan was later shelved, but state authorities continue to give the drug to household contacts of confirmed patients.	0
NewsClaims	5216	Yogesh Jain, a Chhattisgarh-based public-health expert, says he is especially concerned about the use of a potentially ineffective drug among poor people without sufficient monitoring.	0
NewsClaims	5217	"""You are just heaping misery on more people by adding them to an advisory which was not based on any scientific foundation,"" says Jain."	0
NewsClaims	5218	Should pets be tested for coronavirus?	0
NewsClaims	5219	A dog wearing a mask in Shanghai	0
NewsClaims	5220	Science’s COVID-19 reporting is supported by the Pulitzer Center.	0
NewsClaims	5221	Last Thursday, the first cat tested positive for the new coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	5222	The feline had diarrhea, vomiting, and difficulty breathing, and it had come down with COVID-19 about 1 week after its owner did, Belgian health officials announced.	0
NewsClaims	5223	Yet despite these cases—and a third dog that tested positive for coronavirus in Hong Kong earlier this month—the number of pets diagnosed with COVID-19 pales in comparison with the human total, now estimated to be more than 800,000.	0
NewsClaims	5224	And experts, including those at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), continue to emphasize that dogs and cats pose little risk to people.	0
NewsClaims	5225	Still, veterinarians want more information.	0
NewsClaims	5226	Though human tests might work on animals, they are in short supply—and veterinarians prefer species-specific tests, anyway.	0
NewsClaims	5227	Several labs have developed a SARS-CoV-2 test for pets, but none has begun to broadly administer it.	0
NewsClaims	5228	WADDL created its test at the request of local and federal animal health agencies.	0
NewsClaims	5229	Officials were concerned because a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington—site of one of the first U.S. cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in early March—was also home to a number of residents’ cats.	0
NewsClaims	5230	Dogs and cats share many of the same cell receptors we do—which viruses can bind to—and during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (a coronavirus relative of SARS-CoV-2), scientists reported that cats could become infected with the virus and pass it on to other felines.	0
NewsClaims	5231	WADDL’s SARS-CoV-2 pet test is similar to the human test: It uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify RNA from the virus.	0
NewsClaims	5232	Baszler says his team developed it with dozens of archived samples of nasal and throat swabs from cats and dogs collected from the western United States, some of which were seeded with SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	5233	Though none of these animals had COVID-19, the test was able to pick up the virus in the seeded samples, while not reporting false positives for other coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	5234	Baszler says the World Health Organization has approved the diagnostic and that WADDL could start to test up to 100 pets per day, if needed.	0
NewsClaims	5235	IDEXX Laboratories, a global network of more than 80 diagnostic labs, also announced a SARS-CoV-2 test for animals in mid-March.	0
NewsClaims	5236	Like the WADDL test, it’s based on PCR and was developed using samples from cats and dogs.	0
NewsClaims	5237	(In IDEXX’s case, test development used horse samples, too.)	0
NewsClaims	5238	The company has analyzed more than 4000 samples, including specimens from animals with respiratory disorders.	0
NewsClaims	5239	"""All have come back negative,"" says Jim Blacka, the company’s senior director."	0
NewsClaims	5240	"""If there is a need to start testing pets, we’re ready to commercialize it and make it widely available."""	0
NewsClaims	5241	But there are roadblocks to implementing either test.	0
NewsClaims	5242	The first issue is a lack of urgency.	0
NewsClaims	5243	"""Yet nobody is reporting a spike"" in respiratory infections in cats and dogs."	0
NewsClaims	5244	Even the three pets that have tested positive for the virus shouldn’t sound an alarm, says Jonathan Epstein, vice president for science and outreach at the EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that tracks emerging diseases in animals.	0
NewsClaims	5245	"""Detecting RNA is different from [animals] shedding infectious virus,"" he says."	0
NewsClaims	5246	USDA released an FAQ last week that cautioned against pet testing.	0

NewsClaims	5271	GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization played down media reports on Wednesday of “breakthrough” drugs being discovered to treat people infected with the new coronavirus, which is causing an epidemic in China and has spread to at least 20 other countries.	0
NewsClaims	5272	A Chinese TV report said researchers at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus, while Britain’s Sky News said researchers had made a “significant breakthrough” in developing a vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	5273	Oil prices jumped on the reports.	0
NewsClaims	5274	[O/R]	0
NewsClaims	5275	The process of developing and testing drugs or vaccines against a new pathogen normally takes many years and is often fraught with pitfalls and failures.	0
NewsClaims	5276	Even at the accelerated pace enabled by new technologies, the earliest that scientists hope to be able to start initial human trials of a new coronavirus vaccine is by June this year.	0
NewsClaims	5277	Doctors looking for ways to treat patients infected with the new coronavirus are likely to try antiviral medicines licensed for use against other viral infections to see if they might help, as well as potential antiviral drugs still in development.	0
NewsClaims	5278	“It is not approved anywhere globally,” a Gilead spokesman told Reuters in Beijing.	0

NewsClaims	5292	Overview	0
NewsClaims	5293	On 30 January 2020, the BBC reported on the growing number of conspiracy theories and bad health advice regarding COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	5294	Notable examples at the time included false health advice shared on social media and private chats, as well as conspiracy theories such as the disease's origins in (Chinese) bat soup and the outbreak being planned with the participation of the Pirbright Institute.	0
NewsClaims	5295	[6][7] On 31 January, The Guardian listed seven instances of misinformation, adding the conspiracy theories about bioweapons and the link to 5G technology, and including varied false health advice.	0
NewsClaims	5296	[8]	0
NewsClaims	5297	In an attempt to speed up research sharing, many researchers have turned to preprint servers such as arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and SSRN.	0
NewsClaims	5298	Papers are uploaded to these servers without peer review or any other editorial process that ensures research quality.	0
NewsClaims	5299	Some of these papers have contributed to the spread of conspiracy theories.	0
NewsClaims	5300	"The most notable case was an unreviewed preprint paper uploaded to bioRxiv which claimed that the virus contained HIV ""insertions""."	0
NewsClaims	5301	Following objections, the paper was withdrawn.	0
NewsClaims	5302	[9][10][11] Preprints about COVID-19 have been extensively shared online and some data suggest that they have been used by the media almost 10 times more than preprints on other topics.	0
NewsClaims	5303	[12]	0
NewsClaims	5304	"According to a study published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, most misinformation related to COVID-19 involves ""various forms of reconfiguration, where existing and often true information is spun, twisted, recontextualised, or reworked""; less misinformation ""was completely fabricated""."	0
NewsClaims	5305	"The study also found that ""top-down misinformation from politicians, celebrities, and other prominent public figures"", while accounting for a minority of the samples, captured a majority of the social media engagement."	0
NewsClaims	5306	"According to their classification, the largest category of misinformation (39%) was ""misleading or false claims about the actions or policies of public authorities, including government and international bodies like the WHO or the UN""."	0
NewsClaims	5307	[13]	0
NewsClaims	5308	A natural experiment—an experiment that takes place spontaneously, without human design or intervention—shows a potential link between coronavirus misinformation and increased infection and death.	0
NewsClaims	5309	There was one instance of this reported where two similar television news shown on the same network were compared.	0
NewsClaims	5310	One reported the effects of coronavirus more seriously and about a month earlier than the other.	0
NewsClaims	5311	People and groups exposed to the news show reporting the effects later had higher infection and death rates.	0
NewsClaims	5312	[14]	0
NewsClaims	5313	Misinformation on this subject has been used by politicians, interest groups, and state actors in many countries for political purposes: to avoid responsibility, scapegoat other countries, and avoid criticism of their earlier decisions.	0
NewsClaims	5314	Sometimes there is a financial motive as well.	0
NewsClaims	5315	[15][16][17] A number of countries have been accused of spreading disinformation with state-backed operations in the social media in other countries to generate panic, sow distrust, and undermine democratic debate in other countries, or to promote their models of government.	0
NewsClaims	5316	[18][19][20][21]	0
NewsClaims	5317	A Cornell University study of 38 million articles in English-language media around the world found that US President Donald Trump was the single largest driver of the misinformation.	0
NewsClaims	5318	[22][23]	0
NewsClaims	5319	Virus origin	0
NewsClaims	5320	[24] However, many other origin stories have been told, ranging from claims of secret plots by political opponents to a conspiracy theory about mobile phones.	0
NewsClaims	5321	[25]	0
NewsClaims	5322	Wuhan lab leak story	0
NewsClaims	5323	[26][27] Examples of hyperbole regarding this possibility say the pandemic was the result of an accidental leakage of a coronavirus, or that that the virus was engineered as a bio-weapon.	0
NewsClaims	5324	"Some proponents of this theory are dedicated to trying to unearth ""evidence"" which supports it, while attacking evidence which does not support such theories."	0
NewsClaims	5325	"[26] Definitively proving or disproving a ""lab"" related origin of the virus is a difficult and lengthy process, and long investigations are required to provide a definitive proof or disproof of any theory of the virus' origin."	0
NewsClaims	5326	[26][30]	0
NewsClaims	5327	One early source of the bio-weapon origin was former Israeli secret service officer Dany Shoham, who gave an interview to The Washington Times about the Wuhan laboratory.	0
NewsClaims	5328	"[31][32] The Epoch Times, a newspaper affiliated with Falun Gong, refers to the SARS-CoV-2 virus as the ""CCP virus"", and a commentary in the newspaper posed the question, ""is the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan an accident occasioned by weaponizing the virus at that [Wuhan P4 virology] lab?"	0
NewsClaims	5329	"""[33][34] One scientist from Hong Kong, Li-Meng Yan, fled China and released a preprint stating the virus was modified in a lab rather than having a natural evolution."	0

NewsClaims	5331	[35]	0
NewsClaims	5332	"US politicians began spreading the unproven theories of a ""lab"" origin, including Republican Senators Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn, as well as then-President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo."	0
NewsClaims	5333	[36][37][38][39] Many scientists and authorities countered that the theories had no evidence to support the claims being made, including NIAID director Anthony Fauci and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance.	0
NewsClaims	5334	"[40][41][42] One popular idea used incorrectly to support the ""lab"" origin hypothesis invokes previous gain-of-function research on coronaviruses to support the idea that the virus was of laboratory origin."	0
NewsClaims	5335	Virologist Angela Rasmussen writes that this is unlikely, due to the intense scrutiny and government oversight gain-of-function research is subject to, and it is improbable that research on hard-to obtain coronaviruses could occur under the radar.	0
NewsClaims	5336	[43]	0
NewsClaims	5337	"In response to propagation of the ""lab"" origin theory in the US, the Chinese government has promulgated its own version of the conspiracy theory, holding that the virus was developed by the United States army at Fort Detrick."	0

NewsClaims	5341	Chinese espionage involving Canadian lab	0
NewsClaims	5342	Some people have alleged that the coronavirus was stolen from a Canadian virus research lab by Chinese scientists.	0
NewsClaims	5343	"Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada said that this had ""no factual basis""."	0
NewsClaims	5344	[50] The stories seem to have been derived[51] from a July 2019 news article[52] stating that some Chinese researchers had their security access to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, a Level 4 virology lab, revoked after a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation.	0
NewsClaims	5345	Canadian officials described this as an administrative matter and said there was no risk to the Canadian public.	0
NewsClaims	5346	[52]	0
NewsClaims	5347	The article was published by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).	0
NewsClaims	5348	"[51] Responding to the conspiracy theories, the CBC stated that ""CBC reporting never claimed the two scientists were spies, or that they brought any version of the coronavirus to the lab in Wuhan""."	0
NewsClaims	5349	While pathogen samples were transferred from the lab in Winnipeg to Beijing on 31 March 2019, neither of the samples was a coronavirus, the Public Health Agency of Canada says the shipment conformed to all federal policies, and there has not been any statement that the researchers under investigation were responsible for sending the shipment.	0

NewsClaims	5366	[73][74]	0
NewsClaims	5367	On 22 February 2020, US officials alleged that Russia is behind an ongoing disinformation campaign, using thousands of social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to deliberately promote unfounded conspiracy theories, claiming the virus is a biological weapon manufactured by the CIA and the US is waging economic war on China using the virus.	0

NewsClaims	5460	"In April 2020, rumors circulated on Facebook, alleging that the US Government had ""just discovered and arrested"" Dr. Charles Lieber, chair of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department at Harvard University for ""manufacturing and selling"" the novel coronavirus to China."	0
NewsClaims	5461	According to a report from Reuters, posts spreading the rumor were shared in multiple languages over 79,000 times on Facebook.	0
NewsClaims	5462	[146] Lieber was arrested on 28 January 2020, and later charged with two federal counts of making an allegedly false statement about his links to a Chinese university, unrelated to the virus.	0
NewsClaims	5463	The rumor of Lieber, a chemist in an area entirely unrelated to the virus research, creating the coronavirus and selling it to China has been discredited.	0

NewsClaims	5465	Meteor origin	0
NewsClaims	5466	In 2020, a group of researchers that most notably included Edward J. Steele and N. Chandra Wickramasinghe, claimed in ten research papers that COVID-19 originated from a meteor spotted as a bright fireball over the city of Songyuan in Northeast China on 11 October 2019 and that a fragment of the meteor landed in the Wuhan area, which started the first COVID-19 outbreaks.	0
NewsClaims	5467	However, the group of researchers did not provide any direct evidence proving this theory.	0

NewsClaims	5471	Misreporting of morbidity and mortality numbers	0
NewsClaims	5472	Correctly reporting the number of people who were sick or who had died was a struggle, especially during the earliest days of the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	5473	In the US, the public health handling of the pandemic has been hampered by the use of archaic technology (including FAX machines and incompatible formats),[149] poor data flow and management (or even no access to data), and general lack of standardization and leadership.	0
NewsClaims	5474	[150] Privacy laws hampered contact tracing and case finding efforts, which resulted in under-diagnosis and under-reporting.	0
NewsClaims	5475	[151]	0
NewsClaims	5476	Accusations have been made of under-reporting, over-reporting, and other problems.	0

NewsClaims	5479	Chinese under-reporting during early 2020	0
NewsClaims	5480	Leaked documents show that China's public reporting of cases gave an incomplete picture during the early stages of the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	5481	For example, on 10 February 2020, China publicly reported 2,478 new confirmed cases.	0
NewsClaims	5482	However, confidential internal documents that later leaked to CNN showed 5,918 new cases on 10 February.	0
NewsClaims	5483	These were broken down as 2,345 confirmed cases[clarification needed], 1,772 clinically diagnosed cases and 1,796 suspected cases.	0

NewsClaims	5485	Misleading Johns Hopkins News-Letter article	0
NewsClaims	5486	On 22 November 2020 a study by assistant director for the Master's in Applied Economics Genevieve Briand was published in the student-run newspaper Johns Hopkins News-Letter,[155] and later retracted due to it being used to spread misinformation on social media.	0
NewsClaims	5487	The study incorrectly suggested that there were no excess deaths due to COVID-19 in the US without taking into account the total excess mortality from all causes reported during the pandemic, with 300,000 being associated to it per CDC data.	0
NewsClaims	5488	Deaths per age group were also shown as a proportion percentage rather than in raw numbers under the erroneous presumption that they would reflect the effects of the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	5489	In addition, the study observed a reduction in deaths from other causes and suggested that deaths due to heart and respiratory diseases could be being incorrectly categorized as deaths due to COVID-19, failing to take into account that those with such conditions are more vulnerable to the virus and therefore more likely to die from it.	0
NewsClaims	5490	[citation needed]	0
NewsClaims	5491	Allegations of inflated death counts	0
NewsClaims	5492	In August 2020, President Donald Trump retweeted that only 6% of reported COVID-19 deaths in the United States were actually from the disease, based on COVID-19 being the only condition listed on the death certificate.	0
NewsClaims	5493	The lead mortality statistician at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics said that those death certificates likely did not include all the steps that led to the death and thus were incomplete.	0
NewsClaims	5494	The CDC collects data based on case surveillance, vital records, and excess deaths.	0
NewsClaims	5495	[156] A factcheck.org article on the issue reported that while 6% of the death certificates included COVID-19 exclusively as the cause of death and 94% had additional conditions that contributed to it, COVID-19 was listed as the underlying cause of death in 92% of them, as it may directly cause other severe conditions such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.	0
NewsClaims	5496	[157] In mid-October 2020, the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States was reported at 218,511 (CDC), 219,681 (Johns Hopkins University) and 219,541 (The New York Times).	0
NewsClaims	5497	Alleged leak of death toll	0
NewsClaims	5498	On 5 February 2020, Taiwan News published an article claiming that Tencent may have accidentally leaked the real numbers of death and infection in China.	0
NewsClaims	5499	Taiwan News suggested that the Tencent Epidemic Situation Tracker had briefly showed infected cases and death tolls many times higher of the official figure, citing a Facebook post by 38-year-old Taiwanese beverage store owner Hiroki Lo and an anonymous Taiwanese netizen.	0
NewsClaims	5500	[158][better source needed] The article, referenced by other news outlets such as the Daily Mail and widely circulated on Twitter, Facebook and 4chan, sparked a wide range of conspiracy theories that the screenshot indicates the real death toll instead of the ones published by health officials.	0
NewsClaims	5501	"[159] Justin Lessler, associate professor at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, claims the numbers of the alleged ""leak"" are unreasonable and unrealistic, citing the case fatality rate as far lower than the 'leaked information'."	0

NewsClaims	5507	"On 8 February 2020, a report emerged on Twitter claiming that ""data"" showed a massive increase in sulfur emissions over Wuhan, China."	0
NewsClaims	5508	The Twitter thread then claimed the reason was due to the mass cremation of coronavirus victims.	0
NewsClaims	5509	The story was shared on multiple media outlets, including Daily Express, Daily Mail, and Taiwan News.	0
NewsClaims	5510	[161][159] Snopes debunked the misinformation, pointing out that the maps used by the claims were not real-time observations of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) concentrations above Wuhan.	0
NewsClaims	5511	Instead, the data was a computer-generated model based on historical information and forecast on SO 2 emissions.	0
NewsClaims	5512	[162]	0
NewsClaims	5513	A story in The Epoch Times on 17 February 2020 shared a map from the Internet that falsely alleged massive sulfur dioxide releases from crematoriums during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, speculating that 14,000 bodies may have been burned.	0
NewsClaims	5514	[163] A fact check by AFP reported that the map was a NASA forecast taken out of context.	0

NewsClaims	5516	Misinformation against Taiwan	0
NewsClaims	5517	On 26 February 2020, the Taiwanese Central News Agency reported that large amounts of misinformation had appeared on Facebook claiming the pandemic in Taiwan was out of control, the Taiwanese government had covered up the total number of cases, and that President Tsai Ing-wen had been infected.	0
NewsClaims	5518	The Taiwan fact-checking organization had suggested the misinformation on Facebook shared similarities with mainland China due to its use of simplified Chinese characters and mainland China vocabulary.	0
NewsClaims	5519	The organization warned that the purpose of the misinformation is to attack the government.	0
NewsClaims	5520	[164][165][166]	0
NewsClaims	5521	In March 2020, Taiwan's Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau warned that China was trying to undermine trust in factual news by portraying the Taiwanese government reports as fake news.	0
NewsClaims	5522	Taiwanese authorities have been ordered to use all possible means to track whether the messages were linked to instructions given by the Chinese Communist Party.	0
NewsClaims	5523	"The PRC's Taiwan Affairs Office denied the claims, calling them lies, and said that Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party was ""inciting hatred"" between the two sides."	0
NewsClaims	5524	"They then claimed that the ""DPP continues to politically manipulate the virus""."	0

NewsClaims	5533	Misrepresented World Population Project map	0
NewsClaims	5534	In early February 2020, a decade-old map illustrating a hypothetical viral outbreak published by the World Population Project (part of the University of Southampton) was misappropriated by a number of Australian media news outlets (and British tabloids The Sun, Daily Mail and Metro)[172] which claimed the map represented the 2020 coronavirus outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	5535	This misinformation was then spread via the social media accounts of the same media outlets, and while some outlets later removed the map, the BBC reported, on 19 February, that a number of news sites had yet to retract the map.	0
NewsClaims	5536	[172]	0
NewsClaims	5537	Nurse whistleblower	0
NewsClaims	5538	On 24 January 2020, a video circulated online appearing to be of a nurse named Jin Hui[173] in Hubei, describing a far more dire situation in Wuhan than reported by Chinese officials.	0
NewsClaims	5539	The video claimed that more than 90,000 people had been infected with the virus in China, that the virus could spread from one person to 14 people (R 0 =14) and that the virus was starting a second mutation.	0
NewsClaims	5540	[174] The video attracted millions of views on various social media platforms and was mentioned in numerous online reports.	0
NewsClaims	5541	However, the BBC said that, contrary to its English subtitles in one of the video's existing versions, the woman does not claim to be either a nurse or a doctor in the video and that her suit and mask do not match the ones worn by medical staff in Hubei.	0
NewsClaims	5542	[6] The claimed R 0 of 14 in the video was noted by the BBC to be inconsistent with the expert estimation of 1.4 to 2.5 at that time.	0
NewsClaims	5543	[175] The video's claim of 90,000 infected cases was noted to be 'unsubstantiated'.	0
NewsClaims	5544	[6][174]	0
NewsClaims	5545	Decline in cellphone subscriptions	0
NewsClaims	5546	There was a decrease of nearly 21 million cellphone subscriptions among the three largest cellphone carriers in China, which led to misinformation that this is evidence for millions of deaths due to the coronavirus in China.	0
NewsClaims	5547	[176] The drop is attributed to cancellations of phone services due to a downturn in the social and economic life during the outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	5548	[176]	0
NewsClaims	5549	Casedemic	0
NewsClaims	5550	COVID-19 deniers use the word casedemic as a shorthand for a conspiracy theory holding that COVID-19 is harmless and that the reported disease figures are merely a result of increased testing.	0
NewsClaims	5551	The concept is particularly attractive to anti-vaccination activists, who use it to argue that public health measures, and particularly vaccines, are not needed to counter what they say is a fake epidemic.	0
NewsClaims	5552	[177][178][179][180]	0
NewsClaims	5553	David Gorski writes that the word casedemic was seemingly coined by Ivor Cummins – an engineer whose views are popular among COVID-19 deniers – in August 2020.	0
NewsClaims	5554	[177]	0
NewsClaims	5555	The term has been adopted by alternative medicine advocate Joseph Mercola, who has exaggerated the effect of false positives in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to construct a false narrative that testing is invalid because it is not perfectly accurate.	0
NewsClaims	5556	In reality, the problems with PCR testing are well-known and accounted for by public health authorities.	0
NewsClaims	5557	Such claims also disregard the possibility of asymptomatic spread, the number of potentially-undetected cases during the initial phases of the pandemic in comparison to the present due to increased testing and knowledge since, and other variables that can influence PCR tests.	0
NewsClaims	5558	[177]	0
NewsClaims	5559	Disease spread	0
NewsClaims	5560	Early in the pandemic, little information was known about how the virus spreads, when the first people became sick, or who was most vulnerable to infection, serious complications, or death.	0
NewsClaims	5561	During 2020, it became clear that the main route of spread was through exposure to the virus-laden respiratory droplets produced by an infected person.	0
NewsClaims	5562	[181] There were also some early questions about whether the disease might have been present earlier than reported; however, subsequent research disproved this idea.	0
NewsClaims	5563	[182][183]	0
NewsClaims	5564	California herd immunity in 2019	0
NewsClaims	5565	On 31 March 2020, Victor Davis Hanson publicized a theory that COVID-19 may have been in California in the fall of 2019 resulting in a level of herd immunity to at least partially explain differences in infection rates in cities such as New York City vs Los Angeles.	0
NewsClaims	5566	[184] Jeff Smith of Santa Clara County stated that evidence indicated the virus may have been in California since December 2019.	0
NewsClaims	5567	[185] Early genetic and antibody analyses refute the idea that the virus was in the United States prior to January 2020.	0

NewsClaims	5570	"In March, conspiracy theorists started the false rumor that Maatje Benassi, a US army reservist, was ""Patient Zero"" of the pandemic, the first person to be infected with coronavirus."	0
NewsClaims	5571	Benassi was targeted because of her participation in the 2019 Military World Games at Wuhan before the pandemic started, even though she never tested positive for the virus.	0
NewsClaims	5572	Conspiracy theorists even connected her family to the DJ Benny Benassi as a Benassi virus plot, even though they are not related and Benny had also not had the virus.	0
NewsClaims	5573	[188]	0

NewsClaims	5577	[medical citation needed]	0
NewsClaims	5578	Beginning on 11 February, reports, quickly spread via Facebook, implied that a Cameroonian student in China had been completely cured of the virus due to his African genetics.	0
NewsClaims	5579	While a student was successfully treated, other media sources have indicated that no evidence implies Africans are more resistant to the virus and labeled such claims as false information.	0

NewsClaims	5596	People who are considered to look Chinese have been subjected to COVID-19-related verbal and physical attacks in many other countries, often by people accusing them of transmitting the virus.	0
NewsClaims	5597	[197][198][199] Within China, there has been discrimination (such as evictions and refusal of service in shops) against people from anywhere closer to Wuhan (where the pandemic started) and against anyone perceived as being non-Chinese (especially those considered African), as the Chinese government has blamed continuing cases on re-introductions of the virus from abroad (90% of reintroduced cases were by Chinese passport-holders).	0
NewsClaims	5598	Neighbouring countries have also discriminated against people seen as Westerners.	0
NewsClaims	5599	[200][201][202]	0
NewsClaims	5600	People have also simply blamed other local groups along the lines of pre-existing social tensions and divisions, sometimes citing reporting of COVID-19 cases within that group.	0
NewsClaims	5601	For instance, Muslims have been widely blamed, shunned, and discriminated against in India (including some violent attacks), amid unfounded claims that Muslims are deliberately spreading COVID-19, and a Muslim event at which the disease did spread has received far more public attention than many similar events run by other groups and the government.	0
NewsClaims	5602	[203] White supremacist groups have blamed COVID-19 on non-whites and advocated deliberately infecting minorities they dislike, such as Jews.	0

NewsClaims	5604	Bat soup consumption	0
NewsClaims	5605	Some media outlets, including Daily Mail and RT, as well as individuals, disseminated a video showing a Chinese woman eating a bat, falsely suggesting it was filmed in Wuhan and connecting it to the outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	5606	[205][206] However, the widely circulated video contains unrelated footage of a Chinese travel vlogger, Wang Mengyun, eating bat soup in the island country of Palau in 2016.	0
NewsClaims	5607	[205][206][207][208] Wang posted an apology on Weibo,[207][208] in which she said she had been abused and threatened,[207] and that she had only wanted to showcase Palauan cuisine.	0
NewsClaims	5608	[207][208] The spread of misinformation about bat consumption has been characterized by xenophobic and racist sentiment toward Asians.	0
NewsClaims	5609	[209][210][211] In contrast, scientists suggest the virus originated in bats and migrated into an intermediary host animal before infecting people.	0

NewsClaims	6152	Our body does an excellent job of keep itself at constant PH levels (and that level varies depending on where in the body you measure).	0
NewsClaims	6153	But that doesn’t mean that our dietary choices don’t help or hinder certain conditions that are seemingly unrelated to PH balance.	0

NewsClaims	6157	Lilly's bamlanivimab and etesevimab together reduced hospitalizations and death in Phase 3 trial for early COVID-19	0
NewsClaims	6158	- New data show therapy reduced risk of hospitalizations and death by 87 percent - Second positive Phase 3 trial readout for bamlanivimab and etesevimab together - Results support use of bamlanivimab 700 mg and etesevimab 1400 mg, the dose authorized in U.S. and several countries around the world	0
NewsClaims	6159	These results provide additional efficacy and safety data that support the use of the dose recently granted both Emergency Use Authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a positive scientific opinion by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).	0
NewsClaims	6160	This new Phase 3 cohort of BLAZE-1 included 769 high-risk patients, aged 12 and older with mild to moderate COVID-19 (therapy: n=511; placebo: n=258).	0
NewsClaims	6161	There were four events in patients taking bamlanivimab with etesevimab and 15 events in patients taking placebo, representing an 87 percent risk reduction (p0.0001).	0
NewsClaims	6162	Bamlanivimab and etesevimab together also demonstrated statistically significant improvements on key secondary endpoints.	0
NewsClaims	6163	These results are consistent with those seen in other data sets from BLAZE-1: in the previous Phase 3 cohort, bamlanivimab 2800 mg with etesevimab 2800 mg reduced the risk of hospitalizations and deaths by 70 percent and in the Phase 2 cohort, bamlanivimab alone reduced the risk of hospitalizations and ER visits by approximately 70 percent.	0
NewsClaims	6164	The viral load reductions were also consistent with what was observed in the previous Phase 3 cohort of the study.	0
NewsClaims	6165	In this new Phase 3 cohort, there were four deaths total, all of which were deemed related to COVID-19 and all of which occurred in patients taking placebo; no deaths occurred in patients receiving treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together.	0
NewsClaims	6166	Across the two Phase 3 cohorts of the study that have been analyzed to date, there have been no deaths in patients receiving treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, and 14 deaths in patients receiving placebo, 13 of which were deemed COVID-19 related.	0
NewsClaims	6167	In this data set, the safety profile of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together was consistent with observations from other Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials evaluating these antibodies.	0

NewsClaims	6280	Joe Biden received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on live US television on Monday afternoon, in keeping with public officials’ efforts to show Americans such vaccines are safe.	0
NewsClaims	6281	Shortly after 3.20pm, Biden appeared before cameras at a medical facility.	0
NewsClaims	6282	He rolled up his sleeve and said: “I’m ready.” After the jab, Biden thanked scientists and medical workers, saying their efforts were “just amazing”.	0
NewsClaims	6283	He also praised the White House, saying “I think that the administration deserves some credit getting this off the ground” and that the vaccine provides “great hope”.	0
NewsClaims	6284	“There’s nothing to worry about,” Biden also said of receiving the vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	6285	He said that his wife, Jill Biden, had already received her first dose earlier in the day.	0
NewsClaims	6286	Covid-19 has killed at least 317,684 people in the US and infected nearly 17.9 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data.	0
NewsClaims	6287	The same source recorded 189,099 new cases on Sunday and 1,509 deaths, both figures down on record highs last week but for weekend days, when numbers usually drop.	0
NewsClaims	6288	The Covid Tracking Project said 113,633 people were hospitalized, another small drop.	0
NewsClaims	6289	Hospital and intensive care capacity is under intense strain.	0
NewsClaims	6290	The first shots of the Moderna vaccine, which like the Pfizer-BioNTech shot requires two doses but which is easier to store, were packed and shipped from Tennessee on Sunday.	0
NewsClaims	6291	“I don’t want to get ahead of the line, but I want to make sure we demonstrate to the American people that it is safe to take,” the president-elect said.	0
NewsClaims	6292	Top US politicians – including Mike Pence, the vice-president, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, and Mitch McConnell, Republican Senate majority leader – received doses on Friday, putting them among the first Americans to receive injections.	0
NewsClaims	6293	By publicizing their injections, and showing no adverse reactions, they hope to stem a rising tide of skepticism about vaccine safety and efficacy.	0
NewsClaims	6294	Kamala Harris, the vice-president elect, and her husband are poised to get their first doses next week.	0
NewsClaims	6295	Such efforts to show the inoculations are safe are increasingly important, given recent data on American attitudes toward Covid-19 vaccines.	0
NewsClaims	6296	While half of Americans said they would take the vaccine, according to a recent poll, one-quarter of adults said they would not, while another quarter said they weren’t sure.	0
NewsClaims	6297	Experts have said that “herd immunity” – when the overall population is largely immune because a significant portion of it is – will be seen when 60% to 70% reach some level of immunity.	0
NewsClaims	6298	Notably absent from these public campaigns is Donald Trump.	0
NewsClaims	6299	He has mostly remained out of the public eye while continuing to fume over his loss to Biden – and weighing increasingly long-shot attempts to hold on to power.	0
NewsClaims	6300	Trump, who has expressed misinformation about vaccine safety, has not disclosed when he will get his first dose.	0
NewsClaims	6301	Earlier in December, Trump said on Twitter that he was “not scheduled” to receive it, but was looking “forward to doing so at the appropriate time”.	0
NewsClaims	6302	White House officials have claimed that Trump is speaking with his doctors about timing.	0
NewsClaims	6303	In October, Trump was hospitalized with coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	6304	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that people who received such treatment should not receive the vaccine for a minimum of 90 days, to prevent any possible interference.	0
NewsClaims	6305	“When the time is right, I’m sure he will remain willing to take it,” a White House spokesman, Brian Morgenstern, said on Friday.	0
NewsClaims	6306	“It’s just something we’re working through.”	0
NewsClaims	6307	Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, gave a different explanation, telling reporters part of Trump’s decision to wait was “to show Americans that our priority are the most vulnerable.	0
NewsClaims	6308	01:06 'Santa Claus is good to go': Dr Fauci says he vaccinated Father Christmas – video	0
NewsClaims	6309	“The president wants to send a parallel message, which is, you know, our long-term care facility residents and our frontline workers are paramount in importance, and he wants to set an example in that regard.”	0
NewsClaims	6310	This position is at odds with other experts including Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert.	0
NewsClaims	6311	“Even though the president himself was infected, and he has, likely, antibodies that likely would be protective, we’re not sure how long that protection lasts.	0
NewsClaims	6312	So, to be doubly sure, I would recommend that he get vaccinated,” Fauci told ABC.	0
NewsClaims	6313	“We know that infection doesn’t induce a very strong immune response and it wanes over time,” he said.	0
NewsClaims	6314	“So I think, as a clear precaution, it is appropriate to be vaccinated because it’s safe.	0
NewsClaims	6315	I think people should be vaccinated, indeed.”	0
NewsClaims	6316	On March 10, 2020, Now8News published an article positing that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that COVID-19, a disease caused by the new coronavirus, had been found in packages of toilet paper, and that people should start using a wet washcloth to clean themselves instead:	0
NewsClaims	6317	COVID-19 Found in Toilet Paper […] The coronavirus has been found in the one place people never expected, toilet paper.	0
NewsClaims	6318	Testing by Washington State Health department confirmed the COVID-19 virus particles were present in the samples they took from five separate packages of toilet paper from Big Box stores.	0

NewsClaims	6326	“Use a washcloth to clean yourself after you go to the bathroom, it’s not a big deal, that’s what we did back in the old days,” said Peter Lendl, who headed the investigation of the contaminated toilet paper.	0
NewsClaims	6327	“Just know which one is yours.”	0

NewsClaims	6332	Airborne Transmission of Coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	6333	Airborne Transmission in Tight Spaces	0
NewsClaims	6334	This is important news.	0
NewsClaims	6335	Unlike these heavier droplets, airborne diseases can be picked up in airstreams, can travel farther than heavier droplets, and require different prevention strategies.	0
NewsClaims	6336	For the sake of comparison and understanding, heavier droplets are like a bowling ball and smaller airborne droplets are like a ping-pong ball.	0
NewsClaims	6337	The wind or airstream is going to have a greater impact on redirecting a ping-pong ball than it is a bowling ball.	0
NewsClaims	6338	Subsequently, airborne droplets can be caught up in the airstream and recirculated throughout a poorly ventilated building.	0
NewsClaims	6339	This recent development has fast-tracked the recent requirement for wearing masks while indoors.	0
NewsClaims	6340	A New York Times model shows how these droplets can spread from you to others around you.	0
NewsClaims	6341	Loud and Crammed Indoor Spaces	0
NewsClaims	6342	Loud and crammed indoor spaces like bars are also more vulnerable to airborne transmission.	0
NewsClaims	6343	People are congregating in tight spaces and because of the noise levels; they have to talk louder thus expelling droplets more rapidly and forcefully.	0
NewsClaims	6344	The same thing can be said about weddings, church services, birthday parties, and funerals.	0
NewsClaims	6345	These settings usually have people talking, singing, laughing, and crying in small indoor spaces leading to a higher chance of transmission and infection.	0
NewsClaims	6346	Many of these same principles extend to office spaces, schools, healthcare settings, and other indoor places with large gatherings that require face-to-face communication.	0
NewsClaims	6347	For safe social gatherings, health professionals recommend heading outdoors.	0
NewsClaims	6348	Despite the infinite amount of ventilation provided by the outdoors, droplets can still start concentrating after a long enough time of talking, laughing, etc.	0
NewsClaims	6349	increasing the possibility of infection.	0
NewsClaims	6350	For this, health professionals recommend staying distanced, moving, limiting guests, and wearing a mask.	0
NewsClaims	6351	If you are not staying in the same spot, like moving through a grocery store or walking, then your rate of infection decreases.	0
NewsClaims	6352	As of the publication of this blog, doctors have not specified a dosage rate required for infection.	0
NewsClaims	6353	Asymptomatic Superspreaders	0
NewsClaims	6354	Doctors are also still exploring the differences between super-spreaders and less efficient spreaders.	0
NewsClaims	6355	Superspreaders can rapidly spread coronavirus to others even if they are asymptomatic.	0
NewsClaims	6356	To help deter infections by asymptomatic superspreaders, cities and states are implementing mask mandates for indoor spaces since they help filter out larger droplets and can reduce spread.	0
NewsClaims	6357	Many major retailers like Target, Walmart, Kroger, and Aldi are also requiring masks in stores, even if the local government has not mandated it.	0
NewsClaims	6358	Many other retailers have erected Plexiglas barriers between shoppers and workers.	0
NewsClaims	6359	Check with your local store to see their current mandates.	0
NewsClaims	6360	Using these filters in conjunction with an air purifier, helps you quickly change out the air.	0
NewsClaims	6361	This process helps reduce the spread of airborne viruses.	0
NewsClaims	6362	Experts are also still trying to determine how long the virus lives on surfaces.	0
NewsClaims	6363	This determines the risk involved in changing out those virus-filled air filters.	0
NewsClaims	6364	Protecting yourself against COVID-19 and other airborne viruses require a multi-part approach.	0
NewsClaims	6365	Healthy Air System™	0
NewsClaims	6366	Aprilaire also offers a multi-part approach to indoor air quality in your home.	0
NewsClaims	6367	This approach helps protect against airborne viruses and other airborne pollutants like mold, mildew, dander, and odors.	0
NewsClaims	6368	Along with air filtration, we recommend humidity control and fresh air ventilation to best attack those indoor air quality issues as part of our Healthy Air System™.	0
NewsClaims	6369	This suite of solutions uses humidity control to impact those airborne pollutants’ living environment.	0
NewsClaims	6370	Air filtration and fresh air ventilation combine to capture airborne pollutants and bring in fresh air to reduce the proliferation of airborne viruses.	0
NewsClaims	6371	Medical professionals are still learning more about this novel virus.	0
NewsClaims	6372	Until there is a vaccine, it is best to take as many precautions to protect yourself and your family.	0
NewsClaims	6373	You can help protect yourself by wearing a mask, social distancing, and washing hands and surfaces frequently.	0
NewsClaims	6374	This virus has a mortality rate of around 3 to 4 percent and for those that have recovered; it can have long-lasting health impacts as it attacks your heart and brain.	0
NewsClaims	6375	To stay-up-to-date, continue to monitor your local and state health department, and follow CDC guidelines.	0

NewsClaims	6378	Share on Pinterest A variety of myths have sprung up around the novel coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	6379	This article was updated on November 8, 2020	0
NewsClaims	6380	The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread from Wuhan, China, to every continent except Antarctica.	0
NewsClaims	6381	The World Health Organization (WHO) changed their classification of the situation from a public health emergency of international concern to a pandemic on March 11, 2020.	0
NewsClaims	6382	The virus has been responsible for tens of millions of infections globally, causing more than a million deaths.	0
NewsClaims	6383	The United States has been the most affected country.	0
NewsClaims	6384	As ever, when the word “pandemic” began appearing in headlines, people became fearful — and with fear came misinformation and rumors.	0

NewsClaims	6388	Spraying chlorine or alcohol on the skin kills viruses in the body	0
NewsClaims	6389	Applying alcohol or chlorine to the skin can cause harm, especially if it enters the eyes or mouth.	0
NewsClaims	6390	These chemicals can disinfect surfaces, but people should not use them on their bodies.	0
NewsClaims	6391	Also, these products cannot kill viruses inside the body.	0

NewsClaims	6393	Only older adults and people with preexisting conditions are at risk of infections and complications	0
NewsClaims	6394	SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can transmit to people of any age.	0
NewsClaims	6395	However, older adults and individuals with preexisting health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, or asthma, are more likely to become severely ill.	0
NewsClaims	6396	While people under 40 , including children, are less likely to become severely ill with COVID-19, the disease can lead to complications and death in anyone.	0
NewsClaims	6397	3.	0
NewsClaims	6398	Children cannot get COVID-19	0
NewsClaims	6399	Anyone, of any age, can develop the infection that causes COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	6400	So far, most COVID-19 cases have been in adults, but children are not immune.	0
NewsClaims	6401	That said, most children who develop COVID-19 have mild symptoms or none at all.	0
NewsClaims	6402	Also, on May 15, 2020, the WHO released a commentary about an inflammatory condition in children and adolescents that may have links with COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	6403	The condition, called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children , known as MIS-C, has features similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome.	0
NewsClaims	6404	Scientists currently know little about this condition, but research from May suggests that it is rare, “probably affecting no more than 1 in 1,000 children exposed to SARS-CoV-2.”	0
NewsClaims	6405	4.	0
NewsClaims	6406	COVID-19 is just like the flu	0
NewsClaims	6407	Infection with the virus SARS-CoV-2 can cause COVID-19, an illness that can cause flu-like symptoms, such as body aches, a fever, and a cough.	0
NewsClaims	6408	Symptoms of either COVID-19 or the flu can be mild, severe, or rarely, fatal.	0
NewsClaims	6409	Both illnesses can also cause pneumonia.	0
NewsClaims	6410	However, the overall profile of COVID-19 is more serious.	0
NewsClaims	6411	Different countries have reported different mortality rates, and the case fatality rate in the U.S. appears to be around 2.6%.	0
NewsClaims	6412	While scientists are still determining the exact mortality rate based on developing data, it is likely to be many times higher than that of the seasonal flu.	0

NewsClaims	6415	Everyone with COVID-19 dies	0
NewsClaims	6416	This is false.	0
NewsClaims	6417	As we explain above, COVID-19 is fatal for a small percentage of people who develop the illness.	0
NewsClaims	6418	The WHO have reported that around 80% of people with COVID-19 experience a relatively form of the illness and do not need specialist treatment in a hospital.	0
NewsClaims	6419	Mild symptoms may include a fever, a cough, a sore throat, tiredness, and shortness of breath.	0
NewsClaims	6420	Also, many people with the underlying infection experience no symptoms.	0
NewsClaims	6421	6.	0
NewsClaims	6422	Cats and dogs spread the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	6423	There have been several reports of pets developing the infection, including in the U.S.	0
NewsClaims	6424	In most cases, the pets became sick after coming into contact with people who had COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	6425	According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , “There is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.”	0
NewsClaims	6426	Scientists are debating the importance of these cases in animals.	0
NewsClaims	6427	For instance, Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, in the United Kingdom, says:	0
NewsClaims	6428	“We have to differentiate between real infection and just detecting the presence of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	6429	I still think it’s questionable how relevant it is to the human outbreak, as most of the global outbreak has been driven by human-to-human transmission.”	0
NewsClaims	6430	7.	0
NewsClaims	6431	Face masks always protect against the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	6432	Healthcare workers use professional face masks that fit tightly to protect themselves from infections.	0
NewsClaims	6433	Disposable and cloth masks can protect against droplets, but neither can protect against aerosolized particles.	0
NewsClaims	6434	The CDC recommend that all people wear cloth face masks in public areas where it is difficult to maintain a 6-foot, or 2-meter, distance from others.	0
NewsClaims	6435	This helps slow the spread of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	6436	Even while wearing a mask, it is essential to continue with other precautions, such as not touching the face, physical distancing, and washing the hands frequently.	0
NewsClaims	6437	Instructions for making masks at home are available here .	0
NewsClaims	6438	Surgical masks and N95 respirators provide greater protection, but reserve these for healthcare workers.	0

NewsClaims	6440	Hand dryers kill the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	6441	Hand dryers do not kill SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	6442	The best way to protect oneself and others from the virus is to wash the hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds at a time.	0
NewsClaims	6443	When this is not possible, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.	0
NewsClaims	6444	9.	0
NewsClaims	6445	SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold virus	0
NewsClaims	6446	Coronaviruses are a large family, and each has spiky proteins on their surface.	0
NewsClaims	6447	Some use humans as their primary host and cause the common cold.	0
NewsClaims	6448	Other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, primarily infect animals.	0
NewsClaims	6449	Like COVID-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are caused by coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	6450	These viruses also initially passed to humans from animals.	0
NewsClaims	6451	10.	0
NewsClaims	6452	You have to be with someone for 10 minutes to catch the virus	0
NewsClaims	6453	The longer a person is close to someone with the infection, the likelier the virus is to transmit.	0
NewsClaims	6454	However, the virus can pass from person to person in under 10 minutes.	0
NewsClaims	6455	11.	0
NewsClaims	6456	Rinsing the nose with saline protects against the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	6457	There is no evidence that a saline nasal rinse protects against any respiratory infections.	0
NewsClaims	6458	Some research suggests that a rinse might ease the symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections, but scientists have not found that this technique reduces the risk of infection.	0
NewsClaims	6459	12.	0
NewsClaims	6460	You can protect yourself by gargling bleach	0
NewsClaims	6461	People should never put bleach in their mouths.	0
NewsClaims	6462	Gargling bleach could never benefit a person’s health.	0
NewsClaims	6463	Bleach is corrosive and can cause serious damage.	0

NewsClaims	6469	Thermal scanners can diagnose the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	6470	Thermal scanners can detect whether someone has a fever — which might result from any number of health issues.	0
NewsClaims	6471	Symptoms of COVID-19 can appear 2–14 days after the infection develops.	0
NewsClaims	6472	This means that even if a person develops symptoms, they may have a normal temperature for days before a fever begins.	0
NewsClaims	6473	15.	0
NewsClaims	6474	Garlic protects against coronaviruses	0
NewsClaims	6475	Some research suggests that garlic may slow the growth of some species of bacteria.	0
NewsClaims	6476	COVID-19 results from a virus, not bacteria.	0
NewsClaims	6477	There is no evidence that garlic can protect people from COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	6478	16.	0
NewsClaims	6479	Parcels from China can spread the coronavirus	0
NewsClaims	6480	From previous research into coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2, including those that cause SARS and MERS, scientists believe that the virus cannot survive on letters or packages for extended periods.	0
NewsClaims	6481	The CDC explain that “Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products, or packaging.”	0
NewsClaims	6482	17.	0
NewsClaims	6483	Home remedies can cure and protect against COVID-19	0
NewsClaims	6484	No home remedies can protect against COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	6485	This goes for vitamin C, essential oils, silver colloid, sesame oil, garlic, fish tank cleaner, sage, or water, even when a person sips it every 15 minutes.	0
NewsClaims	6486	The best approach is to wash the hands frequently, for 20 seconds at a time, to use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, to wear a face covering in public, and to avoid crowded places.	0
NewsClaims	6487	18.	0
NewsClaims	6488	You can catch the coronavirus from eating Chinese food in the US	0
NewsClaims	6489	No, you cannot.	0
NewsClaims	6490	19.	0
NewsClaims	6491	You can catch the coronavirus from urine and feces	0
NewsClaims	6492	This is likely false, but the jury is currently out.	0
NewsClaims	6493	According to Prof. John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in the U.K.:	0
NewsClaims	6494	“It isn’t a very pleasant thought, but every time you swallow, you swallow mucus from your upper respiratory tract.	0
NewsClaims	6495	In fact, this is an important defensive mechanism.	0
NewsClaims	6496	This sweeps viruses and bacteria down into our gut where they are denatured in the acid conditions of our stomachs.”	0
NewsClaims	6497	“With modern, very highly sensitive detection mechanisms, we can detect these viruses in feces.	0
NewsClaims	6498	Usually, the viruses that we can detect in this way are not infectious to others, as they have been destroyed by our guts.”	0
NewsClaims	6499	However, it is worth noting that some research suggests that viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 might persist in feces.	0
NewsClaims	6500	A research letter in JAMA also concludes that SARS-CoV-2 is present in feces.	0
NewsClaims	6501	20.	0
NewsClaims	6502	The virus will die off when temperatures rise	0
NewsClaims	6503	Some viruses, such as cold and flu viruses, spread more easily in colder months.	0
NewsClaims	6504	This does not mean that their transmission stops in warmer weather.	0
NewsClaims	6505	As it stands, scientists do not know how temperature changes influence the behavior of SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	6506	21.	0
NewsClaims	6507	The coronavirus is the deadliest virus known to humans	0
NewsClaims	6508	While SARS-CoV-2 does appear to be more dangerous than influenza viruses, it is not the deadliest virus that people have faced.	0
NewsClaims	6509	Others, such as the Ebola virus, have higher mortality rates.	0
NewsClaims	6510	22.	0
NewsClaims	6511	Flu and pneumonia vaccines can protect against COVID-19	0
NewsClaims	6512	Because SARS-CoV-2 is distinct from other viruses, no existing vaccines can protect against it.	0
NewsClaims	6513	23.	0
NewsClaims	6514	The virus originated in a laboratory in China	0
NewsClaims	6515	As a recent study demonstrates, SARS-CoV-2 is a natural product of evolution.	0
NewsClaims	6516	Some researchers believe that SARS-CoV-2 jumped from pangolins to humans.	0
NewsClaims	6517	Others think that it passed to us from bats , like SARS did.	0
NewsClaims	6518	24.	0
NewsClaims	6519	The outbreak began because people ate bat soup	0

NewsClaims	6522	5G helps SARS-CoV-2 spread	0
NewsClaims	6523	As the world becomes more connected, some regions are rolling out 5G mobile technology.	0
NewsClaims	6524	This has prompted a raft of conspiracy theories.	0
NewsClaims	6525	One of the most recent to emerge is that 5G is responsible for the swift spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the globe.	0
NewsClaims	6526	This is a myth.	0
NewsClaims	6527	Some people believe that 5G helps viruses communicate, often citing a paper from 2011.	0
NewsClaims	6528	In this study, the authors conclude that bacteria can communicate via electromagnetic signals.	0
NewsClaims	6529	However, experts dispute this theory.	0
NewsClaims	6530	In any case, SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, not a bacterium.	0
NewsClaims	6531	Wuhan was one of the first cities to trial 5G in China, which helps explain the origin of some of these theories.	0
NewsClaims	6532	However, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou also rolled out 5G at a similar time.	0
NewsClaims	6533	It is also worth noting that COVID-19 has significantly impacted countries with very little 5G coverage, such as Iran.	0

NewsClaims	6535	26.	0
NewsClaims	6536	Drinking alcohol reduces the risk of infection	0
NewsClaims	6537	The WHO have released a response to the series of myths surrounding alcohol and COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	6538	They explain that while alcohol can disinfect the skin, it does not have this effect inside the body.	0
NewsClaims	6539	They continue, “Consuming any alcohol poses health risks, but consuming high-strength ethyl alcohol (ethanol), particularly if it has been adulterated with methanol, can result in severe health consequences, including death.”	0
NewsClaims	6540	Also, in a fact sheet on the subject, they explain that “Alcohol use, especially heavy use, weakens the immune system — and thus reduces the ability to cope with infectious diseases.”	0
NewsClaims	6541	And because alcohol is associated with a number of diseases, it may make people more vulnerable to COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	6542	27.	0
NewsClaims	6543	Injecting or consuming bleach or disinfectant kills the virus	0
NewsClaims	6544	Consuming or injecting disinfectant or bleach does not wipe out viruses in the body, and it can be extremely dangerous.	0
NewsClaims	6545	As Dr. Wayne Carter, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham’s Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, in the U.K., explains, “Disinfectants and bleach are strong oxidizing agents, useful to kill bacteria or viruses when they are deposited on surfaces, but these agents should not be ingested or injected.	0
NewsClaims	6546	These agents can cause severe tissue burns and blood vessel damage.”	0
NewsClaims	6547	Dr. Penny Ward, a visiting professor of pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, in the U.K., notes, “Drinking bleach kills.	0
NewsClaims	6548	Injecting bleach kills faster.”	0
NewsClaims	6549	28.	0
NewsClaims	6550	You can contract the coronavirus in swimming pools	0
NewsClaims	6551	As the CDC observe, no evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 transmits via the water in swimming pools, hot tubs, or water parks.	0
NewsClaims	6552	If this water is disinfected with chlorine or bromine, it should inactivate the virus.	0
NewsClaims	6553	Still, the virus can transmit in all the usual ways in these and any other shared spaces.	0
NewsClaims	6554	A person contracts a SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhaling respiratory droplets that contain the virus or coming into contact with infected surfaces.	0
NewsClaims	6555	As in other public places, the CDC recommend staying 6 feet, or 2 meters, away from others at pools and water parks and wearing cloth face coverings when not in the water.	0
NewsClaims	6556	People who operate pools should take extra care to clean and disinfect all facilities.	0
NewsClaims	6557	In a follow-up article, we explore 5 persistent myths about COVID-19 and shed light on the roles of vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc.	0
NewsClaims	6558	29.	0
NewsClaims	6559	If you get a COVID-19 vaccine, you will no longer transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others	0
NewsClaims	6560	The question as to whether the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines might stop SARS-CoV-2 transmission altogether has arisen in the context of speculations about “vaccine passports.”	0
NewsClaims	6561	Such documentation would, in theory, allow people who have had a COVID-19 vaccine to move freely once again.	0
NewsClaims	6562	However, at present there is not enough evidence to prove whether or not thecurrently authorized vaccinesstop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.	0
NewsClaims	6563	The trial results for the Pfizer-BioNTech , Moderna-NIAID , and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines so far suggest they are effective in preventing symptoms of COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	6564	However, research on whether or not these vaccines and other vaccine candidates are also likely to prevent transmission is lacking.	0
NewsClaims	6565	Russian biologist Igor Nikulin, who was presented as a former member of the U.N. Commission on Biological and Chemical Weapons, said in a February 27, 2020 interview on Russia Today's Arabic-language channel that he believes it is no coincidence that the coronavirus has had the effect it has in China, Iran, and certain European countries.	0
NewsClaims	6566	"He said that coronavirus was carefully selected to affect countries that rival the United States and that it is a conspiracy by the ""global government,"" which he said consists of 200 families that control over $400 trillion, that own the media outlets and Hollywood, that control the minds of humanity, and that want to decrease the world's population by 90%."	0
NewsClaims	6567	Nikulin also said that this is a warning to the non-English-speaking world that it must submit to the laws that are imposed upon it.	0
NewsClaims	6568	"Igor Nikulin: ""I believe that it is no coincidence [that China was infected with coronavirus]."	0
NewsClaims	6569	I believe that this virus was selected very carefully, in order to reach countries that are considered to be America's rivals, such as China, Iran, and some EU countries including Italy.	0
NewsClaims	6570	Many people think that there are pro-Russian tendencies in those countries, and this is why we see more infected people in those countries.	0
NewsClaims	6571	I don't think that this is a mere coincidence.	0
NewsClaims	6572	"This is a scheme by the world's elites..."""	0
NewsClaims	6573	"Interviewer: ""The global government..."""	0
NewsClaims	6574	"Igor Nikulin: ""Right."	0
NewsClaims	6575	The global government is the correct term.	0
NewsClaims	6576	At least that is what they call themselves.	0
NewsClaims	6577	No one elected them but this is how they see themselves.	0
NewsClaims	6578	These 200 families have $40 trillion, and they consider themselves to be the most important people on Earth.	0
NewsClaims	6579	They own most of the media outlets.	0
NewsClaims	6580	They are the ones making the Hollywood movies – for example, they make movies about pandemics.	0
NewsClaims	6581	"These families control the minds of humanity, and claim that humanity must be reduced to one-tenth of the current population."""	0

NewsClaims	6583	"Interviewer: ""Is it really possible to produce biological weapons that target a specific nation or ethnic group, and that may infect them but not others?"	0
NewsClaims	6584	There were reports that the Israelis were thinking about producing – or have actually produced – some sort of biological weapon that kills Palestinians but does not harm other Israelis.	0
NewsClaims	6585	Is it true?	0
NewsClaims	6586	"Is it possible?"""	0
NewsClaims	6587	"Igor Nikulin: ""People talk about this."	0
NewsClaims	6588	I know that a few years ago, there was a strange epidemic in Madagascar.	0
NewsClaims	6589	It was not in Africa.	0
NewsClaims	6590	It was a pneumonic plague, which is a horrible thing.	0
NewsClaims	6591	This epidemic killed only the locals, while it did not harm European tourists, and not even the yellow race.	0
NewsClaims	6592	There is also, of course, weapons such as Ebola, Avian Influenza, and the coronavirus that is currently infecting mostly Chinese and other Asian peoples.	0
NewsClaims	6593	Such weapons exist.	0
NewsClaims	6594	In 1999, the Americans started a project...	0
NewsClaims	6595	The head of the CIA at the time, George Tenet, and President Clinton said that they would produce pathogenic agents that would affect certain races but not others.	0
NewsClaims	6596	Twenty years have passed and the time for field experiments has come.	0
NewsClaims	6597	It seems that plant Earth has been turned into a testing ground.	0
NewsClaims	6598	I'll go even further and say that the Anglo-Saxon countries have issued a biological warning to all non-English speaking countries: 'Either you live according to the laws we impose on you, or you will not live on this planet.	0
NewsClaims	6599	Either we kill you fast or we kill you slowly.'	0
NewsClaims	6600	"This is the main problem of modern world policy."""	0
NewsClaims	6601	But not everyone agrees with that hypothesis.	0
NewsClaims	6602	"One expert told Live Science that ""there are a lot of weaknesses"" in the study and that the data don't support the study's conclusions."	0
NewsClaims	6603	Evolution of a virus	0
NewsClaims	6604	Before the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans, two other coronaviruses , SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, evolved in bats and passed through other animals on their way to people.	0
NewsClaims	6605	SARS-CoV passed through civets and MERS-CoV through camels, and the molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that the virus also passed through an intermediate animal , but scientists don't yet know which one.	0
NewsClaims	6606	In February, authors of a preliminary study published to the preprint database bioRxiv suggested that pangolins may bridge the gap between bats and humans, since SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses that infect pangolins sport similar spike proteins — a structure on the surface of the virus that allows it to infect cells.	0
NewsClaims	6607	But other scientists argued that, despite their spike proteins, pangolin coronaviruses bear many differences to SARS-CoV-2 that make pangolins unlikely to be the source of infection, The New York Times reported .	0
NewsClaims	6608	With the mystery unresolved, biology professor Xuhua Xia of the University of Ottawa in Canada launched his own investigation into how the coronavirus passed from bats to people.	0
NewsClaims	6609	His analysis, published April 14 in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution , offered a new solution: dogs.	0
NewsClaims	6610	Xia reached his conclusion by scanning the genetic code of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses for a specific feature known as a CpG site, a sequence of genetic code in which the compound cytosine (C) is followed by the compound guanine (G).	0
NewsClaims	6611	The human immune system sees CpG sites as a red flag, signaling that an invasive virus is present.	0
NewsClaims	6612	A human protein called zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) latches onto the CpG sites on the viral genetic code and recruits help to break down the pathogen, according to UniProt , an online protein database.	0
NewsClaims	6613	The theory follows that, the fewer CpG sites, the less vulnerable a virus will be to ZAP.	0
NewsClaims	6614	Related: 10 deadly diseases that hopped across species	0
NewsClaims	6615	Xia found that SARS-CoV-2 carries fewer CpG sites than the other known coronaviruses that first evolved in animals, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.	0
NewsClaims	6616	In addition, the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2 , the bat coronavirus RaTG13, contains fewer CpG sites than related bat coronaviruses , according to the analysis.	0
NewsClaims	6617	Essentially, in order to survive and reproduce, a pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 needs to be able to evade the host’s immune fighters, and in this case it would mean getting rid of CpG sites that could alert ZAP proteins to the virus.	0
NewsClaims	6618	From the intestines of dogs?	0
NewsClaims	6619	Unfortunately, little data exists on exactly how much ZAP appears in different animal tissues, Xia told Live Science.	0
NewsClaims	6620	So he worked backwards, looking for animal coronaviruses with low CpG levels.	0
NewsClaims	6621	He found a coronavirus that primarily infects the canine intestine, and thus inferred that the dog gut might contain adequate ZAP levels to drive viral evolution in this way.	0
NewsClaims	6622	"""Only canids seem to have the tissue generating low-CpG CoVs during my study,"" Xia said."	0
NewsClaims	6623	"If a precursor to SARS-CoV-2 breached the canine intestine, then this would have ""resulted in rapid evolution of the virus"" to lose CpG sites and become better equipped to infect humans, he wrote in the paper."	0
NewsClaims	6624	Beyond the low CpG levels, the paper did not note other genetic similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and the dog coronavirus, but suggested that the canine gut might provide the right environment for such viruses to evolve.	0
NewsClaims	6625	But why the dog intestine?	0
NewsClaims	6626	Some research suggests that ZAP mRNA, which contains instructions to build the protein, appears in both the dog lung and colon but that higher concentrations accumulate in the lungs, Xia said.	0
NewsClaims	6627	It may be that a glut of ZAP in the lungs guards the organ from coronaviruses, while the lower concentrations of ZAP in the colon leave the gut open to severe infection, though there are reasons to be cautious in coming to this conclusion, Xia said.	0
NewsClaims	6628	But does this hypothesis make sense?	0
NewsClaims	6629	"""I think the data do not support these conclusions,"" Pleuni Pennings, an assistant professor of ecology and evolution at San Francisco State University, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email."	0
NewsClaims	6630	Pennings, whose research group has examined the CpG levels of many viruses, pointed out several weaknesses in the study's logic.	0
NewsClaims	6631	Inconclusive evidence	0
NewsClaims	6632	In a 2018 study published in the journal PLOS Genetics , Pennings surveyed CpG levels in the HIV virus and investigated how the pathogen evolves within individual people.	0
NewsClaims	6633	She then led a similar study of several other viruses — including Dengue fever virus, influenza , and hepatitis B and C — to learn how often these bugs lose or gain CpG sites through mutations.	0
NewsClaims	6634	Her group found that, in general, mutations that add CpG sites tend to be found in viral samples taken from people less often than mutations that remove CpG sites from the genome.	0
NewsClaims	6635	CpG-creating mutations may be costly to viruses in that they alert the body to infection, so over time, evolutionary forces minimize their appearance, Pennings said.	0
NewsClaims	6636	"That said, many viruses still carry CpG sites, so the mutations may carry some benefit ""even if it comes with a slight cost,"" she added."	0
NewsClaims	6637	So SARS-CoV-2 is not unusual in that way.	0
NewsClaims	6638	"""There are many viruses with lower [CpG] values than SARS-CoV-2,"" Pennings said."	0
NewsClaims	6639	"""When you look at all viruses, the [CpG] value is not strange at all,"" she said."	0
NewsClaims	6640	Xia did find that SARS-CoV-2 contains fewer CpG sites than other animal-borne coronaviruses, and assuming that finding is correct, then it raises the question of why that came to be, she added.	0
NewsClaims	6641	But even if there is an evolutionary reason to explain why SARS-CoV-2 lost CpG sites, that evolutionary reason may not give the virus a special advantage for infecting humans, Pennings said.	0
NewsClaims	6642	"In his paper, Xia noted that studies have ""shown an association between decreased CpG in viral RNA genomes and increased virulence,"" meaning low-CpG viruses appear associated with more severe infection."	0
NewsClaims	6643	"However, although evolution favors mutations that delete CpG sites, and there's a general trend tying fewer CpG sites to more severe infection, ""it doesn’t mean that viruses with low numbers of CpG sites are necessarily more virulent,"" Pennings said."	0
NewsClaims	6644	For example, the BK virus contains very few CpG sites and resides in the kidneys of an estimated 60% to 80% of adults , but typically only triggers symptoms in immunosuppressed people, she noted.	0
NewsClaims	6645	(The virus was named the initials of the first person it was isolated from.)	0
NewsClaims	6646	"If the CpG levels present in SARS-CoV-2 are somehow related to disease severity, ""then this would provide an efficient way for vaccine development,"" Xia said."	0
NewsClaims	6647	In this hypothetical scenario, scientists could eliminate CpG sites from the coronavirus genome in a lab dish, thereby weakening the bug to the point that it could safely be incorporated into a vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	6648	But as of yet, no correlation has been drawn between CpG and the relative severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections.	0
NewsClaims	6649	Several pangolin coronaviruses included in Xia's study also contained few CpG sites, on par with SARS-CoV-2 and the bat virus RaTG13.	0
NewsClaims	6650	Given other genetic differences between human and pangolin coronaviruses, however, the ancestor shared between this low-CpG pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 would likely have existed over 130 years ago, Xia said.	0
NewsClaims	6651	"""We expect a SARS-CoV-2 progenitor to be much more recent,"" he said."	0
NewsClaims	6652	But did dogs serve as an intermittent host for the coronavirus?	0
NewsClaims	6653	At this point, there's little evidence to suggest so.	0

NewsClaims	6659	Save this story for later.	0
NewsClaims	6660	Photograph: Getty Images	0
NewsClaims	6661	So now, as we confront what could be a society-altering disease outbreak, it seems worth taking a hard look at the widely reviled yet seemingly ubiquitous electric hand dryer.	0
NewsClaims	6662	Are they as hygienic as paper towels, as their manufacturers claim?	0
NewsClaims	6663	"The earliest pitches for hand dryers played up their supposed ability when it comes to ""preventing the spread of contagious disease,"" as a 1924 newspaper ad for the Airdry Electric Towel put it."	0
NewsClaims	6664	"More recently, Dyson, whose Airblade hand dryer promises to ""scrape water from hands like a windshield wiper,"" has bragged that its HEPA air filter captures particles as tiny as .3 microns in diameter, much like the N95 face masks that are now selling for AirPod Pro–equivalent prices on Amazon."	0
NewsClaims	6665	But the quality of the intake filter doesn’t address whether blowing air at high speeds is a smart idea given that it may be sending droplets and particles from your just-washed hands flying rapidly every which way.	0
NewsClaims	6666	When you dig into the science on hand dryers, you’ll come across reason to be concerned.	0
NewsClaims	6667	A study published in 1989 found that gentler, old-style hand dryers blew bacteria over a three-foot radius and onto the user’s clothes, which considering the era was probably an acid-washed jean jacket.	0
NewsClaims	6668	"It tested conventional hot-air models with and without filters and determined that the filters ""most likely reduce the number of potentially pathogenic bacteria with the potential to colonize hands but do not eliminate the risk entirely."""	0
NewsClaims	6669	"A 2015 study found that super-aggro hand-dryers like the ones made by Dyson, which use higher-speed jets of air at room temperature, ""produced significantly greater aerosolization of virus on the hands"" than the traditional kind."	0
NewsClaims	6670	Paper towels, meanwhile, were found to cause about the same amount of viral spread as hot-air models.	0
NewsClaims	6671	A 2012 analysis of 12 studies over four decades published in	0
NewsClaims	6672	Mayo Clinic Proceedings	0
NewsClaims	6673	"concluded that ""[f]rom a hygiene viewpoint, paper towels are superior to electric air dryers"" and that they should be used in ""locations in which hygiene is paramount, such as hospitals and clinics."""	0
NewsClaims	6674	Though it could be argued that hygiene should be paramount in the restroom of, say, your neighborhood Panera Bread, too.	0
NewsClaims	6675	"The analysis did find that dryers like Dyson’s ""led to much less bacterial transfer than hot air dryers."""	0
NewsClaims	6676	So does that tell us anything about whether hand dryers could spread a virus like the one that causes Covid-19?	0
NewsClaims	6677	I called Peter Setlow, a biochemist at the University of Connecticut and one of the authors of that 2018 study.	0
NewsClaims	6678	"Setlow is a ""spore guy"" not an infectious disease expert, but he nonetheless came away from that research with a deep and abiding distrust of hand dryers regardless of the model."	0
NewsClaims	6679	"""Sorry, hand-dryer industry,"" he told me."	0
NewsClaims	6680	"""My personal opinion is that they shouldn’t be used."""	0
NewsClaims	6681	There’s been understandable blowback from the hand-dryer industry, which questions the methodology of some of this research and notes that certain studies pegging hand dryers as disease vectors—including the one cited above, from 2015—were carried out by researchers who had worked as consultants for paper-towel manufacturers.	0
NewsClaims	6682	This is true in some, though not all, cases.	0
NewsClaims	6683	Dyson got in on the game by funding a study, published last April, that found—surprise!	0
NewsClaims	6684	—hands dried with the company’s own Airblade harbored fewer bacteria than those dried with paper towels.	0
NewsClaims	6685	There’s reason to be skeptical of last year’s paper.	0
NewsClaims	6686	"In the study, subjects ""slowly"" moved their hands in and out of the machine for a full minute, something no normal human is ever going to do."	0
NewsClaims	6687	Besides, Dyson says elsewhere that the model dries hands satisfactorily in a mere 12 seconds, so which is it?	0
NewsClaims	6688	More importantly, that study only looked at the bacteria left behind on hands post-drying, not whether particles might have been blown onto your clothes.	0
NewsClaims	6689	It’s not just a matter of public health: There are fortunes at stake in the science war between the paper-towel and hand-dryer industries.	0
NewsClaims	6690	Multifold paper towels, the kind commonly used in bathrooms, are a several-billion-dollar-a-year behemoth, and one recent estimate of the global market for hand dryers puts the number at a shade under $800 million, and growing.	0
NewsClaims	6691	This is big money and obviously no company wants their products to be viewed as more likely to make people sick.	0
NewsClaims	6692	"Karen Holeyman, lead research scientist and microbiologist at Dyson, also notes via email that ""Dyson Airblade™ hand dryers are proven hygienic,"" and referred to its HEPA air filter."	0
NewsClaims	6693	Yet it’s hard to read the scientific papers without concluding that, well, paper is the way to go.	0
NewsClaims	6694	If the science seems to lean in that direction, though, why have electric dryers continued to claim more and more tiled territory?	0
NewsClaims	6695	For starters, they do have undeniable upsides.	0
NewsClaims	6696	Unlike paper towels, hand dryers don’t create waste and they’re drastically cheaper over time.	0
NewsClaims	6697	The annual cost for paper towels in a public restroom can easily top a thousand dollars, while the electricity required to run a hand dryer costs about a fifth of that, according to one estimate.	0
NewsClaims	6698	But focusing on paper towel prices seems a little ridiculous when epidemiologists are calculating death rates.	0
NewsClaims	6699	We’re at a moment when hand-washing must be taken very seriously.	0
NewsClaims	6700	The same is true for hand-drying.	0
NewsClaims	6701	Electric hand dryers appear to be a modern, more responsible solution to an everyday problem—but one that may not live up to its billing.	0

NewsClaims	6703	Updated 3/12/2020 5:25pm EST: This story has been updated to include comment from Dyson; to clarify that the 2012 analysis from	0
NewsClaims	6704	Mayo Clinic Proceedings	0
NewsClaims	6705	"found that high-speed air dryers ""led to much less bacterial transfer than hot air dryers,"" and that the 2018 study referenced tested conventional hot-air dryers; and to remove any implication that drying hands on pants may be more hygienic than using a hand dryer."	0
NewsClaims	6706	The language has been sharpened and clarified throughout.	0
NewsClaims	6707	"Updated 3/19/2020 5:20pm EST: Since this article was published, Dyson has provided the following statement: ""Karen Holeyman, lead research scientist and microbiologist at Dyson, notes via email that ‘Dyson Airblade™ hand dryers are proven hygienic, and there is no scientific basis to suggest that our hand dryers spread pathogens or are less hygienic than paper towels."	0
NewsClaims	6708	The 2015 study referenced was funded by the paper towel industry and tellingly did not employ methodology which represents real-world use and instead used unwashed hands covered in unrealistically high levels of virus contamination.	0

NewsClaims	6743	"""My gut sense is that [the disease is] much more minor than we’re seeing in people,"" Sykes says."	0
NewsClaims	6744	That could mean pets are silent transmitters of the virus, as some scientists have suggested, but so far there’s no direct evidence for this.	0
NewsClaims	6745	It probably doesn’t make sense to get your pet tested.	0

NewsClaims	6860	The Hindu Businessline	0
NewsClaims	6861	, and	0

NewsClaims	6863	).	0
NewsClaims	6864	Montagnier argued during a TV interview with a French TV channel that elements of the HIV-1 retrovirus, which he co-discovered in 1983, can be found in the genome of the new coronavirus.	0
NewsClaims	6865	"He also said elements of the ""malaria germ"" – the parasite"	0
NewsClaims	6866	Plasmodium falciparum	0
NewsClaims	6867	– can also be seen in the virus’s genome.	0
NewsClaims	6868	"His full quote: ""We were not the first since a group of Indian researchers tried to publish a study which showed that the complete genome of this coronavirus [has] sequences of another virus, which is HIV."""	0
NewsClaims	6869	The new coronavirus is an RNA virus, like HIV.	0
NewsClaims	6870	Scientists already know that many viruses incorporate pieces of other genomes into their own in the natural course of evolution, both of plants and animals.	0
NewsClaims	6871	Indeed, fully 43% of the human genome is composed of mobile genetic element sequences, which are the leftovers of viral infections that our ancestors experienced over the last 300,000 years.	0
NewsClaims	6872	The new virus also has an exceptionally large genome, of about 30,000 nucleobases.	0
NewsClaims	6873	Mobile genetic elements have been discovered in many viruses with large genomes, including coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	6874	The Indian study Montagnier referred to had been authored by a team from IIT Delhi, among others.	0
NewsClaims	6875	They had uploaded their manuscript to the bioRxiv preprint repository only to quickly take it down after commentators pointed out numerous errors in their analysis.	0
NewsClaims	6876	An article published more recently in the journal	0
NewsClaims	6877	Nature Medicine	0
NewsClaims	6878	"What Montagnier called the ""elements"" of HIV were short cis-acting elements"	0
NewsClaims	6879	that scientists had discovered in the genome of coronaviruses in 2005.	0
NewsClaims	6880	They are required for genome replication and are shared by many coronaviruses.	0
NewsClaims	6881	Many experts have already pointed out this obvious flaw in Montagnier’s argument.	0
NewsClaims	6882	"As Étienne Simon-Lorière, a professor at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, said, ""If we take a word from a book and it looks like another word, can we say that one has copied from the other?"	0
NewsClaims	6883	"This is absurd!"""	0
NewsClaims	6884	It is surprising to have a scientist of Montagnier’s stature utter such questionable statements – although Montagnier himself is a controversial figure.	0
NewsClaims	6885	"Among other causes, he has supported anti-vaxxers, homeopathy and a silly claim that DNA emits ""electromagnetic waves""."	0
NewsClaims	6886	As he lost credibility among his peers, scientific agencies around Europe began to reject his grant applications, and eventually he was left with no money to pursue his ideas.	0
NewsClaims	6887	"In a 2010 interview, Montagnier said he was leaving Europe to ""escape the intellectual terror."""	0
NewsClaims	6888	"He added, ""I’m no longer allowed to work at a public institute (in France)."	0
NewsClaims	6889	"I have applied for funding from other sources, but I have been turned down."""	0
NewsClaims	6890	Pandemics have historically been breeding grounds for fake news and conspiracy theories.	0
NewsClaims	6891	"For example, in the 14th century, the bubonic plague epidemic in Europe fuelled a misbelief among Christians that the Jews were deliberately poisoning wells and rivers with infectious ""miasma"", leading to the mass persecution of Jews."	0
NewsClaims	6892	Even when Montagnier helped discover the HIV virus (alongside Françoise Barré-Sinoussi) in the early 1980s, a prominent conspiracy theory in the US was that HIV is a human-made virus that the government had created to wipe out black people.	0
NewsClaims	6893	And because pandemics are so fraught with misinformation, they also make for an important time to communicate good science, double-check suspicious comments, refuse to accept claims without good reason, and not amplify pseudoscience without suitable qualification.	0

NewsClaims	6897	A Kaiser Permanente Southern California study showed that one type of pneumonia vaccine may affect the course of COVID-19 for some older adult patients.	0
NewsClaims	6898	According to Kaiser officials, those who received the PCV13 vaccine appeared to be diagnosed less often with COVID-19 and when they were, they seemed to have less severe outcomes, the study’s senior author Dr. Sara Tartoff, a scientist with Kaiser’s Dept.	0
NewsClaims	6899	of Research and Evaluation, said today when releasing the information.	0
NewsClaims	6900	The Kaiser study was published in	0
NewsClaims	6901	The Journal of Infectious Diseases	0
NewsClaims	6902	.	0
NewsClaims	6903	While the recently authorized COVID-19 vaccines remain the most important strategy for preventing the disease, investigators found that older adults who received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), which prevents acquisition of certain pneumococcal strains, experienced 35% lower risk of COVID-19 diagnosis than adults who did not receive the vaccine.	0
NewsClaims	6904	The study examined electronic health records of 531,033 members of Kaiser Permanente in Southern California who were 65 years old and older from March 1, 2020 to July 22, 2020.	0

NewsClaims	6907	by John Gregory and Kendrick McDonald	0
NewsClaims	6908	Editor’s Note: This report was updated in June 2020 to add additional COVID-19 myths that have become prominent online.	0
NewsClaims	6909	As COVID-19 has spread across the globe, NewsGuard’s team of journalists has been tracking, rating, and flagging websites spreading information about the disease in the Coronavirus Misinformation Tracking Center.	0
NewsClaims	6910	The tracker lists a growing number of websites that have published false claims about COVID-19, from false cures and phony treatments to conspiracy theories about the disease’s origins.	0
NewsClaims	6911	Many of the sites in the tracking center publish the same hoaxes and myths as misinformation spreads virally from one domain to another and through social media posts that amplify false articles.	0
NewsClaims	6912	Here, we document and debunk the top 10 COVID-19 myths that have spread across these sites—and trace how each myth emerged and began to spread across the internet.	0

NewsClaims	6915	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	6916	The evidence provided for the claim was that two Chinese scientists were escorted from the lab in July 2019.	0
NewsClaims	6917	The CBC did, in fact, report that two Chinese scientists were escorted from the lab that month.	0
NewsClaims	6918	However, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) told the CBC that they were asked to leave due to an investigation of what it described as a “policy breach” and “administrative matter,” and that the matter was not connected to the COVID-19 virus outbreak.	0
NewsClaims	6919	“This is misinformation and there is no factual basis for claims being made on social media,” PHAC spokesperson Eric Morrissette told the CBC in January 2020.	0
NewsClaims	6920	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	6921	MYTH: “The COVID-19 virus contains ‘HIV-like insertions,’ suggesting it was engineered.”	0
NewsClaims	6922	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	6923	This claim was attributed to research posted on the website BioRxiv.org, where users can submit scientific studies before they have been peer-reviewed and published.	0
NewsClaims	6924	According to a February 2020 article on the fact-checking website HealthFeedback.org, the study’s finding that there is a similarity between the new strain of coronavirus and HIV “was detected using extremely short protein sequences, a practice that often gives rise to false positive results,” and the authors failed to note that the same sequences are found in many other organisms.	0
NewsClaims	6925	The authors of the study withdrew it from BioRxiv.org two days after it first appeared on the website.	0
NewsClaims	6926	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	6927	The preprint study on BioRxiv.org was first promoted by Harvard University epidemiologist and health economist Eric Feigl-Ding in a series of tweets on Jan. 31, 2020, though he did note the study had not been peer-reviewed.	0
NewsClaims	6928	Ding’s tweets and the preprint study were then cited in a ZeroHedge.com article posted that same day, which was in turn republished in full on InfoWars.com, a Red-rated far-right website that falsely asserted that the mass shooting Sandy Hook Elementary was a hoax, among other false claims.	0
NewsClaims	6929	MYTH: “The COVID-19 pandemic was predicted in a simulation.”	0
NewsClaims	6930	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	6931	The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Gates Foundation did host a pandemic preparedness exercise called Event 201 in October 2019.	0
NewsClaims	6932	However the scenario used in the exercise involved a fictional coronavirus with different characteristics than the COVID-19 virus.	0
NewsClaims	6933	For example, in this simulation, the virus originated on pig farms in Brazil, not in China.	0
NewsClaims	6934	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	6935	This earliest example of this claim was Jan. 22, 2020 post on Reddit’s conspiracy subreddit channel, referencing October 2019 news articles about the simulation along with more recent articles about the outbreak in China.	0
NewsClaims	6936	It was then more widely circulated in a Jan. 23 article from InfoWars.	0
NewsClaims	6937	MYTH: “A group funded by Bill Gates patented the COVID-19 virus.”	0
