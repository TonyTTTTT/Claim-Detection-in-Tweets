OC	512	I guess I felt pretty jaded about this film before I saw it , less so now that I ' ve seen it . . . but I wasn ' t jaded because I ' m just some cynical , bitter queen : I ' m jaded partly because I see the potential for something even MORE wonderful than this film . 	0
OC	513	And I hear that same longing in the word of a lot of the other queens out there who are taken as " bitter . " 	0
OC	514	I can see that way of responding to it ; I was more aware of the differences , and a little more aware that , as painful as some of my own life was in the past , I live a much better life now . 	0
OC	515	And like furr_a_bruin , I ' m ready to see films where the men lead lives a little more like the ones some of us really do get to live these days . 	0
OC	516	Whereas Alan was reminded of how he felt isolated and didn ' t even realize that when he was in college in Indiana in the early 1970s , there were gay bars all over Indianapolis where he could have gone . 	0
OC	517	If we take this story personally as a comment on how much the world hasn ' t changed for gay and bi men , or as a look at a common history many of us share , I think it works a lot better . 	0
OC	518	Much of the progress in our world as gay and bi men has happened because men dared to keep at those kinds of dreams . 	0
OC	519	I also have to say , I ' m always SO uncomfortable when gay men call each other " jaded queens " over their disagreements . 	0
OC	520	I agree that it ' s not all that likely that Hollywood will want to make such films any time soon , but the fact that I have big dreams is NOT a flaw in me , or in anyone else . 	1
OC	521	It just means we have dreams and needs that can ' t always get met right now . 	0
OC	522	Sorry you can ' t make it , but , yes , there will be others . 	0

OC	528	Even if every state has this , that ' s still 50 individuals who think they ' re in charge . 	0

OC	534	Maybe it was -his - fantasy ? 	0

OC	612	I think people are responding strongly to the story partly because of something envirobear said earlier in this thread : " The story . . . is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself . " 	1
OC	613	I think a lot of us are seeing this movie through the lens of our own experiences , and it ' s feeling intensely personal because we line the pain the characters feel up with whatever we ' ve been through that feels similar and was painful at the time . 	0
OC	614	To me , it ' s the film ' s biggest strength AND greatest weakness . 	0
OC	615	I got into a bit of an argument with my own partner last night , because he was telling me about how " this is the story that a lot of gay and bi men still live and struggle with , " and I was saying , " Well , yes , I ' m sure it is , but not exactly , and the differences may be important , and maybe we shouldn ' t overpersonalize this . " 	0

OC	617	catalina = yes . 	0
OC	618	They also told us not to get caught at the gay bars in Denver . 	0
OC	619	Which is to say , by the time I lived in Wyoming , twenty years after the characters in the film were that age , we had words like " gay " and concepts like " gay bar , " even if they were two hours away and sounded scary . 	0
OC	620	I was closeted , felt isolated , and dated a couple of women . . . but even in 1985 , I was vaguely aware that there were other options . 	0
OC	621	Now in 2005 , the options are even greater , even if the isolation and depression and feelings of entrapment still hit a lot of us . 	0

OC	722	Leaving the argument about the words " gay " or " love " out of this , clearly there ' s supposed to be a great deal of passion here - hence the bit about " a force of nature " in the advertising for the movie . 	0
OC	723	You make some excellent points - but my core objection ( perhaps I ' m not expressing myself well ) is very simple . 	0

OC	770	The core of where I was going definitionally was the difference in approach - from my reading thus far , the question , " by what means can we best achieve our goals ? " seems to be the main way in which " schools " of feminism split off from each other ( first-wave example : the suffragists and those who focused on equality in educational opportunities [ educationalists ? ? ] ) 	0
OC	771	I don ' t consider " Marxist " to be part of the definition , nor even " collectivist-socialist " - that bit was more a reflection on how , and in what part of the zeitgeist of the times , radical feminism did much of its developing . 	0
OC	772	Yup , I ' ve been talking about the " different jurisdictions , different conditions " thing all along ( and was pleased to read your German example - I know very little about how it works in countries other than Canada and the US ) . 	1

VG	843	MP What evidence do you have for that ? 	0
VG	844	R that militarily they are unusable , they do not contribute to our security this would change the nature of the debate internationally . 	0
VG	845	R Well history s shown that when certain countries come to conclusion that certain weapons which may have a military utility like landmines or like cluster bombs but which are deemed to be inhumane , that we we have , have come to recognise because of their indiscriminate effects on civilians and so on , are inhumane . 	0
VG	846	This is your aspiration , this is your hope that Iran or whoever Korea , would take notice , but you have no evidence of that at all . 	0
VG	847	MP Here we have a situation where Iran is trying to get the bomb . 	0
VG	848	That when a certain number of countries renounce them and then crossover to the other side and use their , their knowledge and skills of those technologies to promote the disarmament for everybody they can have really powerful effects . 	0

VG	858	If we were to take a look at Arabia before and after the coming of Muhammad , we would see two completely different societies . 	0
VG	859	So this is my ' Problem of Muhammad ' , or ' Problem of Islam ' . 	0
VG	860	They knew because of his outstanding moral character , and from his trustworthy personality 	0
VG	861	They as well , believed with all their hearts that this man , whom they slept with , whom they ate with and whom they fought with , was in fact recieving Revelation from GOD . 	1
VG	862	But , what is different between Muhammad and other perported figures who claimed Divine Revelation , were those who were closest to him . 	0
VG	863	So , if Muhammad exhibited such outstanding moral characteristics that those who were not close to him would come to believe that he was always a trustworthy and honourable person , and that they would have no reason to disbelieve in his claim of Divine Revelation . 	0

VG	867	To make matters worse , that number is estimated to become a staggering 18 million children by 2010 . 	0
VG	868	Think of all those children who are growing up without the care of a mother or father . 	0
VG	869	If there is one thing that we as parents fear more than anything else it is that our children will die before we do , because that is not how it is meant to be ; it is not in the natural order of things . 	0
VG	870	One of the consequences is that an entire generation of grandparents now have to look after an entire generation of their grandchildren , because the generation in between their children ' s generation is in the process of dying . 	0

WTP	1179	Consensus is usually sufficient to remove the tag , but consensus isn ' t necessary to put it there in the first place ; indeed , it ' s usually a lack of consensus that leads editors to tag an article . 	0
WTP	1180	It is uncollaborative to remove a tag without discussion [ 2 ] and for invalid reasons ( like " no consensus to include " ) [ 3 ] . 	0
WTP	1181	Yes , of course it should . 	0
WTP	1182	That ' s the whole purpose of tags : to flag articles so that fresh input can be obtained . 	0
WTP	1183	Obviously , a tag need not be kept if it ' s clearly frivolous , but that ' s not the case here . 	0
WTP	1184	While I think the tag should remain until agreement is reached , I personally don ' t share Levine2112 ' s concerns about NPOV in this case . 	1
WTP	1185	If some editors don ' t think there are NPOV problems , then the venue for expressing that is to use this talk page , not to remove the tag . 	0
WTP	1186	The same logic applies for , e . g , article RfC ' s or noticeboard postings : we don ' t just delete them because we disagree with them . 	0
WTP	1187	Only the controversy over whether or not Wiki considers System of a Down nu metal , I think . 	0

WTP	1232	And if we are going to allow characterizations made by sources which don ' t represent the scientific community in general but kind of slant towards that way , then we also have to include characterizations made by sources which slant the other way . 	0
WTP	1233	I think some editors only want to include sources which are generally regarded as trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	1234	If that were the case , this article would only include items which are definitively pseudoscientific per the scientific community in general ; for if a source is truly trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience , then it speaks for scientific community in general . 	1
WTP	1235	The sources which we choose should be trustworthy / authoritative in presenting the sources characterization . 	0
WTP	1236	I think there might be confusion here . 	0
WTP	1237	@Eldereft . 	0
WTP	1238	Per your point - " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " - remember that the subject at hand is not pseudoscience but rather the characterization of such . 	0
WTP	1239	Essentially , this could be a black-and-white article where we only present items which are definitively pseuodscience per the scientific community in general . 	0
WTP	1240	But once we allow " characterizations " in this article , it ceases to be black-and-white , but rather a range of gray . 	0

WTP	1386	San Francisco does function to some extent as a refuge for LGBT folks , with protections codified into law and an implicit understanding that things like gay-bashing are not tolerated there , so perhaps it does merit mention in the lead . 	0
WTP	1387	Probably true of Boston as well , but in SF ' s case , the city is seen as a " gay " city , much more so than , say , New York is known as a " Jewish " city ( pace Jesse Jackson ' s unfortunate remarks ) . 	0
WTP	1388	Point taken about New York and Jews ; in defense , I ' d say the difference here is that the perceived ( and actual ) character of San Francisco is more inextricably bound up with its larger-than-average share of gay , lesbian , etc . , people . 	0

WTP	1402	Responsible sources dont focus on just the military wing of Hamas , which has admittedly carried out attacks classified as " terrorist " . 	0

WTP	1418	He was not asking God which of all the world ' s religions to join — he was asking God which Christian church he should join . 	1
WTP	1419	It is non-controversial that Smith was a Christian at the time of the First Vision , is it not ? 	0
WTP	1420	But I do think it is disproportionate to mention the abuse scandal in Australia , Canada , Ireland , Mexico , Poland and the United Kingdom , the large financial settlements in Ireland , the number of high ranking prelates who were involved , the affect on the Catholic faithful in Ireland and Poland and the actual number of the victims of the abusers including the methodology for determining the actual numbers . 	0

WTP	1424	The three reasons for keeping the sex abuse section short are : it has its own article , and to make it longer violates WP : Undue Weight and WP : recentism . 	0

WTP	1426	I can ' t imagine more than three US citizens liking " First Master " , and newspapers would have a field day . 	0
WTP	1427	The choice of term is politically touchy , and the female candidate ' s team will have chosen and popularized the " best " one , for instance by mentioning it casually on morning talk shows , well before the nominating convention so that it doesn ' t become a campaign issue . 	0
WTP	1428	The word " Lady " in " First Lady " comes from her social role , and hence " First Master " , although doubtful , is possible . 	0
WTP	1429	" First Husband " has also been hypothesized , although the article does not propose it . 	0

WTP	1563	The new English reformation paragraph could readYou still get the message that Catholics were persecuted and that some Protestants were persecuted , but without unnecessary details that swing it toward pro-Catholic POV . 	0
WTP	1564	19 : 16 , 9 April 2008 ( UTC ) — Preceding unsigned comment added by 	0
WTP	1565	I agree that the Catholic Church did a lot more good than bad ( and still does ) . 	0
WTP	1566	I don ' t believe that the current mentions of persecution of Catholics needs to be removed from the article . 	0
WTP	1567	My concern is that the article as written goes into increased detail about the sufferings of Catholics and barely mentions any suffering that Catholics inflicted , which gives the impression that the RCC has been victimized throughout history ( when in fact it was one of the most powerful institutions for 1000 years ) . 	0
WTP	1568	If the main concern is reasons of space , then let ' s just summarize the persecution of Catholics sufferings . 	0
WTP	1569	Ehh . . . while technically true , I never , for one minute , believed he was including sin taxes in that too . 	0
WTP	1570	Politifact , as well , were debating on whether sin taxes counted . 	0
WTP	1571	However , I ' d personally rate the promise broken , because of the insurance mandate , as the administration are defending it as a tax now . 	0
WTP	1572	I ' d personally wait until the end of the PPACA lawsuits , just to be sure . 	0
WTP	1573	I ' ll have a look in at the discussion tomorrow , and sincerely hope that you ' ll improve your behaviour immediately . 	0
WTP	1574	That isn ' t acceptable anywhere , and is particularly unacceptable on WP : PSCI article . 	0
WTP	1575	You should know better than to put up vague arguments without suitable sources for improving the article , in clear breach of WP : TALK , apparently because you want to make a WP : POINT about the criteria for including subjects in this list . 	0

WTP	1606	" Black Sabbath are arguably the most influential heavy metal band of all time . 	0
WTP	1607	Maybe you recall correctly , maybe not , you don ' t know , " Alright , let me go read that section again . 	0
WTP	1608	You are clearly not a credible agent in this discussion about Black Sabbath , which you admit here . 	0
WTP	1609	" You ramble , man . 	0
WTP	1610	That was oddly phrased . 	0
WTP	1611	" Call it prejudice , but do you dedicated wiki editors develop some kind of deep-rooted persistence to something that is backed by common knowledge and opinion , shared by , what you call , reliable sources alike ? " 	0
WTP	1612	In fact , in the next sentence , it mentions that Time Magazine called Paranoid the " birthplace of heavy metal , " which is pure hype . 	0
WTP	1613	The band helped to create the genre with ground breaking releases such as Paranoid , an album that Rolling Stone magazine said " changed music forever " , and called the band " the Beatles of heavy metal " . " This paragraph is rightfully phrased as representation of an opinion . 	0
WTP	1614	It is also not common knowledge that Sabbath " invented " metal ; that is simply incorrect , and at best a common misconception . 	0
WTP	1615	If you ' re saying what I think you ' re saying , then no . 	0

WTP	1617	It will make this article richer and abide better with the three core content policies - especially WP : NPOV . 	0
WTP	1618	Remember , this article attempts to " tell the story " of topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	1619	I think we should still include historical characterizations , but make it clear that the characterization is historical . 	1
WTP	1620	If a topic was once characterized as a pseudoscience by some notable source but later called a science by the same or other notable source , let ' s provide all of the details . 	0

WTP	1628	The why is what I ' m most interested in , and I hope you can dig up some information to add into the article so we can further elaborate on this topic , as its much needed in the body on the article . 	0
WTP	1629	The second set of statements , if they belong anywhere , would make most sense in an article on LBGT politics or sociology . 	0
WTP	1630	The first kind of statement arguably might belong in the lead of the SF article . 	0
WTP	1631	However , a great many people will argue with the statements that 1 ) SF is a " haven for LGBT , " and that 2 ) this is a defining characteristic of the city . 	1
WTP	1632	No one will argue with the fact that SF is known for its large LBGT population . 	0
WTP	1633	It ' s best to leave the lead as it is now . - - 	0
WTP	1634	Finally , the second set of statements is tarnished with POV and is almost impossible to back up with an unbiased verifiable source . 	0
WTP	1635	I will do that and attempt to squish into the arbitrary " 4 " paragraphs ; feel free to revert , undo , or re-edit . 	0
WTP	1636	I certainly agree on the previous names ; not needed in intro . 	0

WTP	1639	Haven ' t read the whole article thoroughly yet , but looking over it , it ' s pretty clear that ( a ) the whole Popper-evolution issue is far more complicated than I had realised , and ( b ) using Popper as a source for a claim that evolution is pseudoscience isn ' t appropriate . 	0

WTP	1645	Yes , if you were going to use / ɕ / due to legibility or typographic concerns ( say , the way we use / r / for English , even though it ' s not a trill ) , then I ' d think you ' d use it for z , not for s . 	0
WTP	1646	Obviously Duffy does not offer the reader any historical document to discredit Irenaeus , its just his opinion that its " suspiciously tidy " . 	0
WTP	1647	Xandar , Eamon Duffy is a most respected historian whose opinion can and will be brought up by those who will call our article a POV if we dont present his view in equal proportion to the Roman Catholic Church view supported by the historian Edward Norman . 	0
WTP	1648	Is that right ? - - 	0
WTP	1649	The source of the original controversy is a translation made by government funded sources , so we ' re looking to sources outside of the government now to clarify and verify . 	0

WTP	1652	The Holy See does not have very good relationship with the Muslim world based upon the pope ' s past comments and positions . 	0

WTP	1655	I - for one - do not think this article is NPOV . 	1
WTP	1656	I think it is tightly POV in reference to the Catholic Church and is not a 360 degree view of the Church . 	0

WTP	1659	And Zeppelin III ' s current five stars from Allmusicgiude ( wikipedia ' s biggest misplaced trust ) is pure hype , as we all know . 	0
WTP	1660	Same goes for Led Zeppelin III ; it has always been seen as a relative downfall in the middle of Zeppelin II and Zeppelin IV , which were hailed from the start . 	0
WTP	1661	Maybe Grand Funk Railroad were reviled because they never were any good ? 	0
WTP	1662	You fail to see the essence of what I ' m stating , Albert . 	0
WTP	1663	Even now , in retrospect , they aren ' t hailed or remembered as innovators , by anyone . 	0
WTP	1664	Thought of that ? 	0
WTP	1665	Do I need to say that a smug-faced editor came and rejected everything with wikipedian policy and subtle insults that commented on my " regrettable " wikipedia history ? 	0
WTP	1666	I actually commented , just recently , on the Zeppelin article , where I criticized its overuse of reliance on Rolling Stone Magazine ; it practically bases its whole introduction with hails from that tacky magazine that includes 20 Beatles albums in its top 10 of the greatest albums ever . 	0
WTP	1667	What I added later was that , as an Israeli and army veteran , it ' s easy to notice a few more details that identify the event better than a foreigner would . 	0
WTP	1668	That was exactly my point ! 	0
WTP	1669	I fully support removing this picture from this article . 	0
WTP	1670	However , this is not relevant to the article , and constitutes original research . 	0
WTP	1671	— 	0
WTP	1672	I didn ' t remove it for it not being unreliable , though I understand that aspect . 	0
WTP	1673	I do not consider that this gallery " adds to the reader ' s understanding of the " IDF by " illustrat [ ing ] aspects of [ the ] subject that cannot be easily or adequately described by text or individual images . " 	0
WTP	1674	The images in the gallery collectively must have encyclopedic value and add to the reader ' s understanding of the subject . 	0
WTP	1675	From WP : IG : However , the use of galleries ( usually by way of the gallery tag or gallery template ) may be appropriate in Wikipedia articles where a collection of images can illustrate aspects of a subject that cannot be easily or adequately described by text or individual images . 	0
WTP	1676	Oh , I don ' t anything about that noticeboard . 	0
WTP	1677	But get rid of the gallery . 	0
WTP	1678	Obviously , if there is a large chunk of unadorned text , you can put a relevant image there . 	0
WTP	1679	I ' ve given options for using some of your favourite images - replace the less useful existing ones . 	0
WTP	1680	So the gallery should be scrapped . 	0
WTP	1681	I guess you don ' t approve of a source that is geared to young adults like those who attend Universities ? 	0
WTP	1682	> The rewrite makes the sentence incorrect . 	0
WTP	1683	The part about Protestant propaganda per my source was that the two brutal non-church initiated or controlled inquisitions of Philip IV of France and Spanish Inquisition was used by Protestants to demonize the Catholic Church for centuries . 	0
WTP	1684	I do not agree that the paragraph should have been changed to eliminate this fact . 	0
WTP	1685	The Spanish Inquisition was the worst of them all and executed many people 3-4000 per my source . 	0
WTP	1686	I disagree with the change also , I left a note on Xandars page . 	1
WTP	1687	As the user also noted in their recent edits , the medical consensus on the issue is that HIV does cause AIDS . 	0
WTP	1688	The lead was recently changed by User : Neuromancer to indicate that the causative role of HIV in AIDS isn ' t proven ( see diff ) . 	1
WTP	1689	Thus I think adding a caveat about the unproven nature of HIV ' s causative role in AIDS isn ' t just an example of undue weight , but is furthermore incorrect . 	1
WTP	1690	To my understanding , if medical consensus supports some hypothesis based on verifying experiments and overwhelming amounts of empirical evidence , then that notion is considered a scientific fact . 	0
WTP	1691	Based on that rationale , I ' ve reverted Neuromancer ' s edits for the second time . 	1
WTP	1692	Neuromancer also added to the lead a paragraph citing research from 1982 and 1983 , which I consider more appropriate for other sections of the article if it ' s to be included at all . 	0
WTP	1693	I ' d like to get Neuromancer ' s thoughts on this , as well as feedback from other editors - - with whom I presume but would like to verify I share a consensus - - so that my recent reversion doesn ' t seem like a single-editor fiat . 	1
WTP	1694	It ' s not articles on good things and bad things , it ' s just articles . 	0
WTP	1695	yeah , sorry my reply was to him , not to you , i ' ve tabbed correctly now Haaretz is definitely reputable as a source to use on Wikipedia . 	0
WTP	1696	— 	0
WTP	1697	Obviously , I would expect any book dealing with 1967 to discuss the USS Liberty incident . 	0
WTP	1698	However , every book dealing with 1967 also discusses its various battles which are not mentioned in this article , and I don ' t think they should be . 	1
WTP	1699	For example , with all due respect to the Battle of Ammunition Hill , likely more significant in the long term than the Liberty incident , it simply did not impact the IDF in a major way to be included here . 	0
WTP	1700	Again , don ' t forget that we have a History of the Israel Defense Forces article , which I encourage people who want to go into more detail to have a look at . 	0
WTP	1701	after reviewing the sources on the matter i believe the translation to something like " wipe zionism from the pages of history " seems to be more credible . 	1
WTP	1702	with free online translation services there is no excuse not to go check the origin when available . 	0
WTP	1703	we are discussing in english things said in parsi so we have to be extra careful and doubel check any resource claiming to bring a translation . 	1
WTP	1704	as for the topic discussed , i think eyalmc has provided sufficient resources to show that the translation " wipe israel off the map " is a misquote . 	0

WTP	1708	I would like to ask other editors whether they would find it acceptable to add a flag in the Northern Ireland history section or not , and if so which ? 	0
WTP	1709	I agree ; ending with just landmarks is bland . 	0
WTP	1710	But how are we going to word this ? 	0
WTP	1711	I find " non-heterosexual orientation , " uh , kind of weird . 	0
WTP	1712	— 	0
WTP	1713	Name something you want to add , somthing that has reliable sources and something that is significant . 	0
WTP	1714	I think the solution would be to move some of the content and sources to the article cunt ( which already discusses the issue but not in as much depth ) and the rest of the content to the Wiktionary entries on the words rabbit , coney , cunny etc . I ' m assuming you ' ll be ok with this so I ' m going to go ahead and make the necessary changes . 	0
WTP	1715	- - 	0
WTP	1716	I would be willing to consider this , but I suspect such an article may quickly find itself either merged back into this article or deleted . 	0
WTP	1717	I also feel a little uncomfortable making such a move when your expressed purpose is still that of censorship . 	0
WTP	1718	I simply cannot find in myself any impulse to limit who is allowed to read this content , because it expresses the truth , and the truth is never a bad thing to let someone read . 	0
WTP	1719	However , if I am completely honest , I have to concede that going by the strict letter of the WP : NAD policy it may well be the case that the naming section does not really belong in this article regardless of objectionable content . 	1
WTP	1720	This Telegraph article highlights the NPOV problem with this article . 	0
WTP	1721	Voice of the Faithful does not buy the argument that " clamour created in the US around this scandal is really unbearable " as Cardinal Bertone said . 	0

WTP	1723	From your edits this seems to bother you for another reason . 	0

WTP	1725	He gets published in a local paper . 	0
WTP	1726	But there have been enough wars involving such states in modern times that it really is something for which MILHIST ought to have developed techniques . 	0
WTP	1727	I think this article suffers from some of that with glamorous pitures of equipment women soldiers , disucssion of the code of ethics in most of the article followed by the scandal . 	0
WTP	1728	It would follow Wikipedia guidelines better if say discussion of scandals associated with particular wars occurred in the place where those wars are mentioned and if the more extreme ethical abuses were included in the discussion of the ethical cide . 	0
WTP	1729	Controversy sections ( and even more so articles ) need to be handed with care as they often become content / POV forks . 	0
WTP	1730	Do you get an article which mainly consists of blurb about how wonderful and saintly a particular person or institution is written by their fans or employees and then it has a subsection about how it has been claimed on an obscure website that they eat babies . 	0
WTP	1731	It is of the nature of occupying armies that they abuse the occupied . 	0
WTP	1732	Obviously it would be somewhat peculiar to have a controversies section in Roman Army saying that it sometimes sacked cities , raping , killing or enslaving large chunks of the population . 	0
WTP	1733	also we should be aware of WP : Recentism and spend too much time on complaints about what happenned in Gaza just because it is fresh in our minds . 	0
WTP	1734	On Wikifan ' s point about there not being similr coveerage elsewhere it might be worth an approach to the WP : MILHIST project and suggest they produce guidelines on how to deal with this . 	1
WTP	1735	Controversies go in , as per WP : LEAD . 	0
WTP	1736	That ' s utterly non-negotiable . 	1
WTP	1737	The fact that it is controversial totally , always and everywhere trumps concerns about recentism . 	0

WTP	1742	As I ' m new to editing this page , you surmised correctly that I was unaware of any previous editing decisions such as having to abide by your consensus-approved outline . 	1
WTP	1743	So I appreciate the synopsis here and I ' ve already performed an undo back to your approved version that had removed all my content . 	0
WTP	1744	However , your arguments seem entirely based on this being " criticism " and the " scale " of the operation not fitting this article ' s scope . 	0
WTP	1745	I still would contend that what I ' ve added , however " disproportionate " it might seem , is not what you describe and object to as " criticism " ; this is an incident of combat soldiers coming forward ( tardily ) to report on possible ( or evident ) breaches of the IDF # Code of Conduct against militants and Palestinian civilians during an operation fought in a densely populated area , that may be considered ( and ultimately judged ? ) as along the lines of atrocities or war crimes . 	1
WTP	1746	If you and the other editors overrule this content ' s inclusion here , on what page — dealing with combat ethics in the IDF — would it belong ? 	0
WTP	1747	I see there ' s no main article on Israel Defense Forces # Code of Conduct . - - 	0
WTP	1748	I also have appreciated the efforts of numerous editors who have been watching the page and reverting vandalism , these have been a great help . 	0
WTP	1749	I appreciate the bots and I did notice they were working - great invention . 	0
WTP	1750	I hope consideration of future security will be considered if the vandalism increases , especially when we are at FAC . 	0
WTP	1751	I just thought that an article like this would qualify for the kind of protection given other high profile articles , especially when we are on track towards FAC . 	0
WTP	1752	I think there clearly is . 	0

WTP	1757	Just like this talk page is about improving the article , not about arguing about whether the virus exists , has been isolated , causes AIDS or has been imaged by EM . 	0
WTP	1758	Yes . 	0
WTP	1759	This article is about a virus , HIV , not about opinions . 	0
WTP	1760	Just a thought . 	0
WTP	1761	Or something to that effect . 	0
WTP	1762	I would suggest changing " HIV-specific treatment delays this process " to " HIV-specific treatments have been shown to delay this progression in most , though as with any form of chemotherapy , there are inherent risks . " 	0
WTP	1763	I like what you ' ve done . . . 	0
WTP	1764	Throwing it in there for you to roll it around your tongue for a few . 	0
WTP	1765	Well , here are my two cents about what to cut ( based on what seems out of place for a lead , not based on any numeric target for length ) : 1 ) sentence starting " Previous names " ( none of these are in wide use today ) , 2 ) sentence starting " HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4 + T cells " ( too much detail for the lead ) , 3 ) somehow merge the paragraph starting " Eventually most HIV-infected individuals develop AIDS . " with the mentions elsewhere about opportunistic infections , antiretrovirals , etc ( I ' m not as sure about how to do this one ) . 	0
WTP	1766	While consensus can block sources due to a lack of quality , it cannot block simply because they claim consensus . 	0
WTP	1767	Furthermore , according to that same article , " Likewise , exceptional claims in Wikipedia require high-quality reliable sources , and , with clear editorial consensus , unreliable sources for exceptional claims may be rejected due to a lack of quality . " 	0
WTP	1768	- - 	0
WTP	1769	Logically , Wikipedia consensus should not be all that ' s needed to make a fringe theory notable , just as it should not be all that ' s needed to reject notable and well-sourced criticisms . 	0
WTP	1770	As for the epidemiology , it does seem like a lot of numbers , but we should hit high points like the huge impact on Africa ( I ' ve trimmed a bit of the language but it could probably be shorter still ) . 	0
WTP	1771	Until and unless one of the abovementioned things , or some other major detail , arises that fundamentally moves the story or resolves some loose end , I really don ' t see the problem with the size of the piece given what it covers . 	0
WTP	1772	Quite probably ; if it does , then that would be what would be relevant to mention here , if Obama used this moment of crisis to set a new or accelerated course . 	0
WTP	1773	If he doesn ' t , then that could be what would be relevant to mention , that despite this major incident we soldiered on with the drilling because ( the public / Southern governors / the oil industry complained that the loss of oil industry jobs was worse for the economy and the country than the possibility of future such accidents ? ) and as a result we were ( just fine / experienced a few more but as with terrorism under George W . Bush , that became the new normal / were utterly devastated by a series of catastrophes that ended life as we know it ) . 	0
WTP	1774	That ' s the problem with news , it ' s just news until it ' s history . 	0
WTP	1775	We could fight any mention of the spill , or we could acknowledge that unlike other distractions this is a real thing with likely real repercussions in the real world , and err on the side of making this section , you know , bigger than the automaker rescue and almost as big as health care ( both of which are also still unfolding and yet to be added to or updated ) . 	0
WTP	1776	At such time as there is a clear culprit for the cause , we could then focus on that and drop one or even two of the other company names in this bio version of the story , but until such time , that would be irresponsible . 	0
WTP	1777	At such time as the commission announces measures and Obama enacts them , we can shift the focus of those mentions to that enactment . 	0
WTP	1778	At such time as there is a real and understood shift in energy or environmental policy , we might drop a couple other issues to note that . 	0
WTP	1779	If someone wants to remove the criticism that Obama and the federal government should do more , we can whittle down some of what he ' s done , but if we did that , people would arrive re-adding that aspect . 	0
WTP	1780	I ' ll say it again , if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama ' s biography , I will not object at all . 	0

WTP	1785	No interpret here , just know how to read English . 	0
WTP	1786	And the very weird part of your argument is that I do some interpretation by linking words " Zionist regime " to article " Zionist regime " . 	0
WTP	1787	But that " just enough " of course has to be accurate . 	0
WTP	1788	We should explain just enough so that lay people can understand how it does or does not apply to evolution . 	0
WTP	1789	If the answer to both questions is " yes , " then I think we shoulod keep in the misconception , and explain it . 	1
WTP	1790	For me the questions are , ( 1 ) are these widely held misconceptions and ( 2 ) will explaining them help people understand the scientific theory of evolution and why it is so powerful and widely accepted among scientists ? 	0
WTP	1791	I think the question of whether the misunderstandings are common among creationists is in and of itself irrelevant . 	1
WTP	1792	Surely we all agree that it should be both accurate and accessible . 	0

WTP	1795	In this case what is important is how the 2nd law does or does not relate to evolution , and I think this is indeed an important point . 	0

WTP	1798	False dichotomy . 	0
WTP	1799	It ' s inappropriate and undue weight to mention BP several times and the other companies not at all when it was Transocean who owned , staffed and operated , and was responsible for , the drilling of the well and the drilling rig that exploded ( and lost 11 crew ) and it was Halliburton contractors who had done the vital job of cementing , particularly given that faulty cementing by Halliburton was alleged to be a factor in two other major blowouts . 	1
WTP	1800	Both of those companies figured about as prominently as BP in several Congressional hearings , and it is conceivable that one or both will ultimately be found partly if not fully responsible for the blowout . 	0
WTP	1801	It ' s undue weight and out of context if we were to mention people expressed frustration at the president without noting that there was even more frustration being expressed toward BP et al . On the other hand , it ' s similarly undue weight and out of context to note frustration and perception and not to give an adequate picture of what was really going on , either before or after , as reliably sourced , and further , to give it in a timeline as it actually happened and not as the storyline in the media has played out . 	1
WTP	1802	It would be absurd to note this happened without noting BP ' s failure to stop this early , as their plan suggested they could and would ; yet at the same time , it would be inappropriate to note their failures without noting that they eventually had success in capturing a huge amount of oil , considering they were capturing absolutely none of it for over a month . 	0
WTP	1803	It ' s essentially slander to keep naming BP as though they ' re the only company involved , while ignoring the other companies at the heart of this . 	0
WTP	1804	I have left out Anadarko , despite the fact they own 25% of the well and 25% of the oil , and the Japanese company who owns 10% , despite the fact that more than 1 / 3 of the oil involved in this is not owned by BP , and I have left out Cameron International who manufactured the blowout protector , , as it was past the warrantee period and it has come to light that Transocean modified the BOP counter which voids Cameron ' s responsibility . 	1
WTP	1805	And of course , once you ' re going to note more than one event , you need to establish a timeline Frankly , as I said when I first edited this section , I don ' t think any of this is really relevant to this bio yet . 	1
WTP	1806	Will it ultimately lead to a major shift in energy policy , or a major environmental and engineering response ? 	0
WTP	1807	In a nutshell , I ' d propose this : We can include any topic that has been called PS by a reliable source ( whether or not said source is " right " or reflects a majority scientific view ) . 	1
WTP	1808	As long as a sourced view is significant enough to be mentioned in a topic ' s article , it should suffice here . 	0
WTP	1809	( Tiny minority views such as " Darwinism is a pseudoscience " would be mentioned neither here nor in Darwinism . ) 	0

WTP	1818	" About it having heavy blues undertones spanning the rest of the album is mere crap , and you know it , such rhetorical filling is unnecessary . " 	0
WTP	1819	Not crap , truth . 	0
WTP	1820	Actually , by that same logic Uriah Heep ' s debut would be the first progressive metal album . 	0
WTP	1821	Frankly , I think actually classifying the album itself ( Sabbath Bloody Sabbath ) as " progressive metal " is rather drastic , despite the current state of Wiki ' s article on it . 	0
WTP	1822	While we ' re housecleaning polls , can somebody explain why the Siena College poll , currently at the end of the section , belongs here in its current form ? 	0
WTP	1823	The only cited reference is the poll release from Siena itself , so noteworthiness can be legitimately questioned . 	0

WTP	1827	This does not exonerate the Catholic Church but I think it indicates more of a cultural problem that can not be discounted . 	1
WTP	1828	The US Dept of Education report also found that in order to avoid bad press , the principals of the schools where the abuse happened would often not report the abuse or prosecute the teacher but allowed them to be transferred to new schools . 	0
WTP	1829	Such figures led her to contend " the physical sexual abuse of students in schools is likely more than 100 times the abuse by priests . " 	0
WTP	1830	That compares with about five decades of cases of abusive priests . 	0
WTP	1831	Extrapolating data from the latter , she estimated roughly 290 , 000 students experienced some sort of physical sexual abuse by a school employee from a single decade — 1991-2000 . 	0
WTP	1832	To support her contention , Shakeshaft compared the priest abuse data with data collected in a national survey for the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation in 2000 . 	0
WTP	1833	" So we think the Catholic Church has a problem ? " she told industry newspaper Education Week in a March 10 interview . 	0
WTP	1834	Charol Shakeshaft , the Hofstra University scholar who prepared the report , said the number of abuse cases — which range from unwanted sexual comments to rape — could be much higher . 	0
WTP	1835	According to a draft report commissioned by the U . S . Department of Education , in compliance with the 2002 " No Child Left Behind " act signed into law by President Bush , between 6 percent and 10 percent of public school children across the country have been sexually abused or harassed by school employees and teachers . 	0
WTP	1836	" Now , on the heels of the Catholic abuse scandal comes another of historic proportions — one that has the potential to be much greater and far-reaching . 	0

WTP	1856	I agree . 	0
WTP	1857	Wikipedia ' s page on Criticism simply defines it as " the judgement ( using analysis and evaluation ) of the merits and faults of the actions or work of another individual . " 	0
WTP	1858	Criticism by many reliable definitions would simply be negative statements . 	1
WTP	1859	I have a hard time believing you ' re trying to place as a definition of criticism that it has to have basis in fact . 	0
WTP	1860	Logically then , I ' m not sure where you ' re coming up with this definition of the word . 	0
WTP	1861	According to Princeton ' s definition , for example , a critic can be defined simply as " someone who frequently finds fault or makes harsh and unfair judgments " . 	0
WTP	1862	Regardless of whether it is fact-based ( and I have my doubts ) , supported by ' legitimate editors ' ( I notice you are going to try and disqualify some of the many editors who have in the past brought this up ) , and regardless of whether it is a fringe theory , it can still be discussed if notable and reliably sourced . 	1

WTP	1877	Perhaps someone can correct me , as I ' m far from an expert on Islam ; but it doesn ' t seem consistent to me to regard Roman Catholicism , Orthodoxy and Protestantism as separate " faiths " , while regarding all branches of Islam as the same faith . 	0
WTP	1878	( It may , however , be the case that even Sunni Muslims , who make up about 85% of Muslims , outnumber Catholics ; but that doesn ' t seem to be the story as presented ) . 	0
WTP	1879	The two aren ' t really comparable , though , are they ? 	1
WTP	1880	Christianity , with around two billion members , is the largest faith . 	0
WTP	1881	The Roman Catholic Church , with around a billion members , is the largest single religious body . 	0
WTP	1882	Islam is a faith containing several religious bodies ; it may be larger than the Roman Catholic Church , but it isn ' t larger than Christianity and isn ' t a single body ( there is the well-known divide into Sunni and Shi ' a for a start ) , so I don ' t actually think that this is an especially significant fact . 	0

WTP	1923	A century and a few decades later , the article about Cole , when combined with the other article supporting Smith ' s claim to have seen heavenly visions , his Anti-Mormon voice provides credibility to the idea that Smith told people about his vision before the Church was established in 1830 . 	0
