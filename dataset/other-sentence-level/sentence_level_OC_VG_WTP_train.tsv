OC	58	I don ' t feel like it ' s so astute to point out that the Oscars are kind of pompous and out of touch . 	1
OC	59	Plus criticisms like that , coming from someone who lost , just come off as petty . 	0
OC	60	Add the excessive bitterness , and I don ' t think she really accomplished more than making herself look like an ass . 	0

OC	72	/ end rant from motorcyclist with a brain . . . . and alive after 13 years of riding in sydney traffic : P Edited at 2008-03-05 02 : 27 am UTC 	0
OC	73	Only idiots ride in between lanes . 	0
OC	74	Gay , bi , or whatever , I think that ' s the lesson I learned , and the film is about what happens if you * don ' t * learn and apply that lesson . 	0
OC	75	The publicity for the film gets the film wrong , but I think the film gets this point sort of " right . " 	0
OC	76	I hear you more clearly . 	0
OC	77	I suppose I could agree with you and still go in a slightly different direction : I think stunted passion can drive people to lead lives in which they appear to be passionless . 	1
OC	78	It ' s not an easy mindset to recall after nearly a decade being out of the closet , but I would say that I spent a good deal of my 20s , when I felt both uncomfortable with my own sexuality and isolated about being who I was , using my drive and my power as an intellectual , emotional , and spiritual being to either route my passion anywhere BUT sex , or to holding myself in . 	0
OC	79	In a sense , what the movie gets " right " for me happens most clearly with Ennis ' s character : the force of nature of his passion is one he devotes to containing himself , rather than trying to break free . 	0
OC	80	And he does fail to contain himself in many ways . . . but what ' s tragic is that had he failed a little more , he might have been able to succeed at something a lot more fulfilling . 	0
OC	81	Does that make any sense ? 	0
OC	82	Maybe one way I could come at it is nothing more than this : I had a couple of clunky , difficult relationships with women before I came out as a queer man , and I ' ve had a couple of decent relationships with women since coming out , fucking around with a lot of men , and giving my whole heart and soul to a couple of men over the years . 	0
OC	83	Which is to say : although my desires for women are a fairly small part of my overall makeup , I could only express them decently once I took the brakes off my WHOLE self . 	0

OC	96	There is also a group rallying against our practices with sheep ! ! ! 	0
OC	97	( Sheep have a flap of ' foreskin ' type thing that hangs off their butts and gets painfully infected by parasites and leads to their death - so sheep herders in the maritimes have been and other peoples have been cutting that skin off for THOUSANDS OF YEARS - but now they ' re writting letters to us demanding we ban it . 	0
OC	98	They ' ve got pictures circulating of people from Abu Ghraib , covered in what appears to be shit and blood , being beat , hung upside down , raped and worse - though I shudder to think of what could be worse than what I ' ve seen so far . 	0

OC	141	* smacks blonde wig on Axel * I think as far as DiZ is concerned , he is very smart but also in certain areas very dumb - - witness the fact that he didn ' t notice his apprentices were going to turn on him , when some of them ( cough Vexen cough ) aren ' t exactly subtle by nature . 	1

OC	143	Before this game , I was kind of thinking that Xemnas ' s actions were suspicious , but seeing Saïx going around clearly being in charge - - and very invested in making sure no one challenges his control - - well , I wonder how carefully edited the reports that made it to Xemnas ' s ears were . 	0
OC	144	I kind of wonder how much Xemnas knew about Castle Oblivion , now . 	0

OC	170	Barring a clear choice based on teachers , however , you might want to save Buddhism for a later part of your undergraduate career . 	0

OC	203	The folks they officially grant permission to perform exorcism are supposed to be levelheaded enough to avoid this kind of bad press , while still combating the possessions the Church has to believe occur now and then . 	0
OC	204	It seems counterintuitive , but the Church knows just as well as anyone how ridiculous they would look treating every rebellious teen as possessed , or what have you . 	0
OC	205	The chief of the branch should be even more responsible than the run-of-the-mill exorcist , not less . 	0
OC	206	Yes . 	1
OC	207	Well , frankly ? 	0
OC	208	The job of exorcist is supposed to be rather like folks involved in canonization - to be skeptical , seek solid evidence , then act - not to see devils everywhere and try to solve every problem with exorcism . 	0
OC	209	I don ' t believe in their party line , but they do , and this is inconsistent with what the job is supposed to entail , if I remember correctly from Catholic Boot Camp . 	0

OC	217	I cant even imagine what the medical examiner had to face when they showed up . and I also remember that at first I assumed the husband who got killed was the guy she was fighting over . 	0
OC	218	she got the idea from being a chemical expert in the army , but apparently the training and expertise didnt delve far enough into body disposal . 	0
OC	219	I remember reading that the acid didnt work out as well as she would have hoped . 	0
OC	220	and I havent seen anything on the internet posted since the army took over her prosecution and made her disappear . 	0
OC	221	ya , I cant believe she did it in the first place , and then that she wandered around with the baby and then confessed ! 	0
OC	222	so let that be a lesson . . . if youre gonna cheat on your husband , do it with a guy who doesnt also have an insane homicidal stalker . 	0

OC	1576	We ' re apparently supposed to fake it . 	0
OC	1577	WHERE ' S MY GIRL JESSICA ? 	0
OC	1578	Obviously everyone except for Wilf is protected by not having fully human DNA and thus being immune to the overwrite . 	0
OC	1579	So are we supposed to assume that the only non-Master people left on the planet are Wilf , the Doctor , Donna , and maybe the green people ? 	0
OC	1580	The Naismith family also needs some background info , as well as the green people . 	0
OC	1581	Still , how does a former prime minister gather a crazed group of disciples ? 	0
OC	1582	Presumably , because at the end of series three they only rewound to right before the arrival of the American convoy , there ' d still be stuff left about Saxon ' s existence . 	0
OC	1583	I hope they go into the development of the cult of Saxon or w / e that was , it was really sudden . 	0

OC	1594	What makes it even harder is the fact that she is admittedly open to both sexes , which makes things seem even more possible , but I don ' t know how to reconcile my feelings for her . 	0
OC	1595	I have been struggling with this for a really long while and she has expressed interest in meeting me as well . 	0
OC	1596	I really , really want to meet her , but I am afraid because I don ' t know what to expect , if anything . 	0
OC	1597	Thank you for the opportunity to get this off of my chest . 	0
OC	1598	I can ' t seem to get over this insane crush that I have on a girl that I met in the Colbert community . 	0
OC	1599	She and I have a lot in common and I always eagerly await her comments , replies , etc and find myself wanting to do things for her and talk to her , but I already have someone in my life and it is frankly really confusing . 	0
OC	1600	Part of me is telling myself to be careful because I already have someone , but another part of me really wishes that I could go for her . 	0
OC	1601	I honestly have little attraction to men as a rule in the physical sense , so personality , talents , mannerisms , and interests become more of the basis for my feelings for someone . 	0
OC	1602	( although it does lead to humourous hittings of the öä keys instead of what I was going for , along with adds like the one in my icon ) Hope all is well with you ^_^ 	0

OC	1615	I can understand not always agreeing with every parenting choice , cuz I mean , come on , there are so many options . 	1
OC	1616	I ' m sorry you had to go through this , and I ' m sorry she did as well . 	0
OC	1617	At least , in the end , she knew that people cared and that she was not alone . 	0
OC	1618	Oh man that realllly doesn ' t appeal to me . 	0
OC	1619	But thank you for the neato idea = D 	0

OC	1627	We ' ve had a couple of similar incidents in a different part of Nova Scotia , where would-be thieves knocked out power by trying to cut through live wires to steal copper . 	0
OC	1628	Drink them up like fine wine . 	0
OC	1629	They were easier to find , but not alive to press charges against . 	0
OC	1630	Or it could cast one ' s group as people who are never happy with anything and therefore not worth bothering to try and with . . . 	0

OC	1633	An hour just doesn ' t seem long enough to fit it all in . 	0

OC	1637	Oh lord , you ' re right when you say you can ' t even begin to string the episodes together . 	0

OC	1645	SO CUTE ! 	0
OC	1646	I use Photobucket because it ' s easy and the service it provides is enough for what I do ( read : not a lot ) . 	0
OC	1647	But I wouldn ' t recommend it if you intend on linking a lot of people to it because it has a tendency to go " OMG TOO MANY PAGE VIEWS EXCEEDED BANDWIDTH WE ARE GONNA MAKE DIS IMAGE UNAVAILABABLE UNTIL NEXT MONTH ! " 	0
OC	1648	I -could - be wrong about it , but I ' m pretty sure I ' m not . 	0
OC	1649	I was going to suggest Facebook , but FB has a 60 image limit per album and uploads can be a bit of a bitch . 	1
OC	1650	It crashes a lot in the middle of big uploads , which is very frustrating . 	0
OC	1651	Not a single one . 	0
OC	1652	Yeah , must be something like that . 	1

OC	1654	Maybe the Time Lords get hold of him or something . 	0

OC	1674	: ) i have a crappy memory but i didn ' t forget . 	0
OC	1675	i seem to have successfully extracted myself from academia , for the time being - - somehow managed to graduate last sunday - - and have landed in the most mahvelous summer job at the tar pits as the assistant excavator and it ' s like summer camp , only better , because i get PAID to learn anatomy and hang out with the loveliest people and i HURT everywhere my last day at the vile lawfirm was tuesday first day at the museum on wednesday and five days straight excavating since then and i hurt EVerywhere my back , my right arm , my left palm , my abdominal muscles , my feet - - which is bizarre because i spend most of my day lying on my stomach , leaning over a 3 x 3 foot grid of asphalt picking at dead animals and i am just so thrilled to be in so much pain it ' s great and i don ' t have a paper to write ! 	1
OC	1676	my god ! 	0
OC	1677	i read book six of the harry potter series on monday , and i ' m starting on ' bleak house ' tomorrow i can read for fun ! 	0

OC	1700	well i could visit tomorrow night probably . . . ! ! ! ! ! ! 	0
OC	1701	do you have plans RIGHT after work tomorrow ? 	0
OC	1702	It ' s hard to resist arguing with them , but they ' re all so fucking stupid that it doesn ' t even get you anywhere . 	0
OC	1703	I know , it ' s irritating . 	0
OC	1704	I have issues with " film critics " who insert their own visions of what they believe is " proper sociology " --whether it ' s a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances . 	0
OC	1705	Some people have issues with the story . . . others don ' t want to deal with the hype about it . . . . others see something to it . . . and all points of view are fine . 	0
OC	1706	As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life ' s difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not . 	0
OC	1707	I ' ve had my own experience in losing people and property by murder , death , robbery , and accident to know that it ' s awful to live through and easier to deal with with the compassion of others . 	0
OC	1708	I don ' t have to live through a hurricane myself in order to do SOMETHING to help people affected by one . . . 	0
OC	1709	Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my " thing " for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship . . . she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad . . . 	0
OC	1710	If you can ' t put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my " logic " , then the storyline will hold nothing for you . . . and that would be unfortunate . 	0
OC	1711	No , you don ' t need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to " legitimately " comment on it . . . for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation . 	1
OC	1712	And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of " holding court " . 	0
OC	1713	I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-centered hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors . 	0
OC	1714	Aha ! 	0
OC	1715	Yes , it was completely anonymous . 	0
OC	1716	Nice picture , though ! 	0

OC	1733	I just got a call from my mother two minutes ago : " I ' m on my way home from work and I ' m about to pass by IHOP . 	0
OC	1734	Sometimes the " I am putting all the food I own into this one meal before it goes bad while I am at home for a week " meal ends up being pretty damn good , but it was not the International Passport with Swedish pancakes and lingonberries . 	0
OC	1735	So I made myself a spinach salad with sliced pears , crumbled bacon , shredded Jarlsberg cheese , and raspberry vinaigrette . 	0
OC	1736	I had every intention of going to the Harvard Square IHOP on Saturday afternoon before flying back home , but I realized that I had a ton of food in my fridge that needed to be cooked and eaten ( including a pound of salmon that had gone bad anyway - FAIL ) . 	0
OC	1737	Does that not mean anything to you ? 	0
OC	1738	I will never understand why there are people in the world who don ' t - it ' s the INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF FUCKING PANCAKES , everyone . 	1

OC	1746	For usability it ' s probably worse , though . 	0
OC	1747	And honestly , if I wanted to have a screenshot of a site to make it look nice , I ' d probably at least consider using Safari ; the stuff is more typographically " correct " using that rendering , which in the context of an image of a site may well look better . 	0
OC	1748	A lot of people seem to prefer it , though . 	0
OC	1749	Will go fix , thanks ! 	0
OC	1750	Heh , this is what happens when I model for stuff - apparently my hands ( esp . thumb ) do not behave like normal people ' s . 	0

OC	2129	It ' s better / easier for me if I use packaged egg whites , because then I have a hope of using the " leftovers " before they go bad . 	1
OC	2130	As to why I don ' t have shell eggs , it ' s twofold : I do better when I avoid egg yolks , and my use of eggs in general is mostly for baking . 	0
OC	2131	So as long as I keep that in mind and reduce the oil by at least 1 / 3 , it should be okay . 	0
OC	2132	Really , the only thing likely to give me fits is the egg / oil mix , because I ' ve found that my egg white breads don ' t " hold " the oil the same way when made with whole eggs . 	1
OC	2133	I don ' t have any milk-milk , so I ' ll need to reconstitute some from powder , then measure it , because I ' m not sure exactly how much powder and water are needed for three tablespoons ( 2tsp of powder and 8tsp of water ? ) and with quantities in this range , there ' s less tolerance for error , but that ' s not bad . 	1

OC	2145	The only reason our schools are " competitive " is because the administration choose to do things like this : force us to choose between our own school and everyone else . 	0

OC	2156	It ' s generally a bad idea to make one ' s " feminist " argument at the expense of actual women ' s experiences . 	0
OC	2157	if something causes wisps of steam to begin issuing from my ears , I will almost certainly learn something significant from it . 	0
OC	2158	There are folks whose writing I read primarily for that purpose - though a fair chunk of the time , it ' s my own argument that gets vivisected . 	0

OC	2169	It ' s not just an academic exercise in utopian philosophy ; real people , with diverse individual needs , will be living the changes we make . 	0
OC	2170	Making feminist arguments at the expense of actual women ' s experiences is , IMO , one of the most significant fracture points within feminism , The reverse is also true : the political is personal . 	0
OC	2171	Mind you , Canada isn ' t perfect , by any means ; another part of why it was possible for me is because my family was supportive - I ' d have been in a much more precarious position if they weren ' t . 	0
OC	2172	Kid won , of course . ) 	0
OC	2173	( My son ' s father didn ' t even get an opt-in ; he was . . . not very stable - but again , Canadian conditions meant I only had to consider that problem in terms of the personal , weighing fairness to him against what it could mean for my baby if he took it into his head to try for custody . 	0
OC	2174	I ' m pretty sure we ' re at least close to the same page - it ' s partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter ' s father opt out . 	1
OC	2175	( IOW , I think he might be a Nice Guy ( tm ) . ) 	0
OC	2176	What I suspect here is that he has a vested interest in not changing the institutional injustices , because in a just world , women wouldn ' t need men . 	0
OC	2177	I suspect the latter , because of him bringing up " pregnancy is so dangerous " as an argument supporting mandatory support - the only connection I can see between them is that the financial support would mean better health care ( assuming the father , or his parents , have or are able to earn enough to make a difference ) and an improved , but not risk-free , outcome ; otherwise , obligating the father ' s involvement has no effect on those dangers ( or may have a negative effect ) . 	0
OC	2178	I ' m not so sure the KiSA is on your side ; he didn ' t seem to have the slightest interest in the injustices I was trying to talk about - at best , he ' s convinced they ' re immutable ; at worst , he ' s got a hidden agenda . 	1

OC	2834	They manage to scrape together the money for their own ranch , and indeed have a period of some happiness together , during which they wind up shooting to death a couple shitheads who come to their spread with the intent of killing our protagonists - in circumstances that make it clear it was self defense . 	0

OC	2841	I don ' t recall the characters in the story being portrayed as being particularly dim , so I find it difficult to believe that EVEN in the given setting , it ' s impossible for them to conceive of a way to be together that would slip under the radar , or behind the common presumptions of the time , at least for a while . 	0
OC	2842	I ' m no stranger to holding a minority opinion in a variety of fields , but it ' s been rare that I ' ve gotten this much personal hostility over openly stating I dislike a particular story , and that I can ' t for the life of me understand why people are cumming all over themselves about it . 	0

OC	2865	The McLellan family had written to Canadian senators to say they cancelled a vacation in Canada because of the hunt , which they called " horrible " and " inhumane , " Montreal ' s La Presse reports . 	0
OC	2866	While I don ' t at all agree with the seal hunt , I give huge props to this : Senator fires back at U .

OC	2867	She said Americans are not in a position to criticize others . 	0
OC	2868	In her response , Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette said that what she finds horrible is " the daily massacre of innocent people in Iraq , the execution of prisoners – mainly blacks – in American prisons , the massive sale of handguns to Americans , the destabilization of the entire world by the American government ' s aggressive foreign policy , etc .

OC	2871	Full article . 	0
OC	2872	CNN probably unfairly concluded that blacks overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , but it doesn ' t excuse anyone for voting for prop 8 , because a lot of every race was responsible for its passage . 	0
OC	2873	( Actually , the pro-8 people really really twisted it so bad it made me want to puke . ) 	0
OC	2874	We all know religion was what caused the passage , but my main gripe was that people decided to fall on religion instead of their experience to vote . 	0
OC	2875	But let ' s assume that poll conducted by CNN was severely flawed as speculated . 	0
OC	2876	I was more upset that a majority of people who voted for the issue didn ' t see the measure as an issue of rights and equality for all , just about gay marriage . 	0
OC	2877	Again , expectations were turned upside-down , and that was what upset me the most . 	0
OC	2878	Even the Catholic church made a huge push to support 8 as well , but the Hispanics who are usually very religious only barely supported the measure . 	0
OC	2879	So many good ones to choose from ! 	0
OC	2880	Turns out it was the other way around . 	0
OC	2881	I originally thought that the Hispanic population would have overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , and that the blacks would be 50 / 50 . 	0

OC	2925	Formulation of this may have been started back in January , but somehow it disappeared and the administration has admitted this is only being done because some big money gay donors started to pull out of a big DNC fundraising soiree over the administration ' s hate brief on DOMA . 	0

OC	3295	After my post a bit earlier in Windows Safari , kurisu posted this fascinating article on the differences between Windows and OS X ( and now Safari for Windows ) font rendering , which has puzzled me for ages . 	0
OC	3296	I think it ' s fair to say that neither is " better " , but it ' s interesting to see the way the different approaches go . 	1

OC	3306	Anyone know where I can get seasons 3-6 that isn ' t a choppy , garbley mess with a giant logo slapped over a huge part of it ? 	0
OC	3307	The only good thing about this whole nightmare is seeing how loving and selfless people are being towards the victims of this fire . 	0
OC	3308	And that doesn ' t even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 ' s . 	0
OC	3309	It ' s one thing to not understand what you ' ve never experienced , it ' s another thing entirely to disdain what you don ' t understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over . 	0
OC	3310	You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L . A . or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story . . . and if you ' ve never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die . . . then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story . 	0
OC	3311	The story of " Brokeback Mountain " is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says " Oh , Bob--I LOVE YOU ! " and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying " THIS IS A LOVE STORY . . . YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . " 	1
OC	3312	And while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the " ivory tower " . 	1
OC	3313	I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein--he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear . 	0
OC	3314	They are happy to be urban--and urbane- - " queers " of 2005 , and they never presume to " lower themselves " to understand lives that are different from their own . . . very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population . . . as " W " has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life . 	1
OC	3315	That is the big problem with blowhards like them- - they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men . . . therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them . 	0
OC	3316	I ' m pretty numb right now and trying to stay that way so I don ' t have a meltdown . 	0
OC	3317	But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted . . . and depression , too . 	1
OC	3318	It ' s a love story alright . . . but it ' s a tragedy , too . . . passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that can ' t be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love . 	0

OC	3654	I think my spiffy new icon tells you quite a lot about what I , as a feminist , think of men ( however they identify ) who want to slay villains for me . 	0
OC	3655	As I ' ve already mentioned , I ' m down with ( authentic ) male feminists ; they are my brothers-in-arms , and I ' m very glad to have them fighting beside me , watching my back , and all those other good warrior metaphors . 	0

OC	3659	So - you can see Sir Lancelot in action at Derek ' s Doing Feminism - not Derek ; you should have no trouble identifying the guy in the tin suit in the comments , even before I take him to task . 	0
OC	3660	Since ol ' Lance has already transformed himself into Brave Sir Robin and flounced ( ' bout a six , I figure ; the execution was technically quite good , if unoriginal , until he spoiled it by coming back for one parting shot ) , there ' s little point in piling on him there ; I doubt it ' ll penetrate his + 4 Armor of Complacence ( what , surely you don ' t think he won ' t sneak back to see how we took it ? ) , and it ' ll just distract further from what could be a very productive discussion ( which you could join if you ' re so inclined ) . 	0
OC	3661	Anyway , it wouldn ' t be courteous to Derek . 	0
OC	3662	And , since I ' m going to mention over there that I ' ve snarked about it here , with link , chances are we ' ll have a meal of Silly Knigget deliver itself right to my doorstep - dinner ' s on me ! 	0

OC	4105	I mean , if you think of " the Devil " as " the personification of evil , or as an anthropomorphic conception of evil " , and sex abuse is evil , and the coverup of evil is evil , and the coverup of the sex abuse came from within the Vatican , then , well , yes , the Devil is at work inside the Vatican . 	0

OC	4386	And it gets more complicated of course , because some Protestants believe that salvation is through faith alone , some through faith and acts , and some still even believe in Pre-Destination , which means either you ' re on the list or your not and nothing you do in this life has a bearing on that . 	1
OC	4387	Protestants don ' t have that option , because they don ' t believe their preachers stand in for God , and so they don ' t have the power to absolve . 	0

OC	5014	This particular argument has more to do with social standards . 	0
OC	5015	It is accepted that all people are " sinners " but Christians are supposed to repent their sins . 	0
OC	5016	I ' m not a Christian so I ' m not sure how " Grace " figures into this discussion . 	0
OC	5017	My understanding is that " grace " has to do with salvation . 	0
OC	5018	My argument is just that it is hypocritical to punish homosexuals for being unrepentant sinners but allow divorced people off the hook . 	0
OC	5019	Christ didn ' t say anything about homosexuals but he was quite explicit about divorce . 	0
OC	5020	The issue seems to be that giving social status in the Church to unrepentant sinners would encourage sin by setting a bad example . 	0

OC	5056	That is what I would say to myself : you think you have fallen to the point where he is essential to push you out of bed , you need somebody to do it and he is the only one that cares enough . 	0
OC	5057	They were right ; they just handled the announcement poorly . 	0
OC	5058	That there is even a need for that implies that people aren ' t happy with the government . 	0
OC	5059	The essence of the social contract is that if people aren ' t happy , the government should change--not that the government should try to gather intelligence to increase its power over them . 	0

OC	5109	Ermm . . . 	0
OC	5110	I ' ll say that your inner circle of friends are prolly the only ones you should be as honest as you want with . 	0
OC	5111	Why ? 	0
OC	5112	Ok , that kinda means that being confrontational with everyone is a bad idea . 	1

OC	5233	Sometimes the arguments are so devoid of intelligence , or I ' ve heard them so many times before , that there ' s no reward in refuting them , but if the other side is willing to engage , then having to explain myself and not getting any free passes means that the argument gets a good workout . 	0
OC	5234	Is this HHGGTG ? 	0
OC	5235	But right now we don ' t have that . 	0
OC	5236	Instead , we have conservative think tanks complaining that what little aid we do give costs too much . 	0
OC	5237	What " choice for men " comes down to for me is who bears the cost instead . 	1
OC	5238	I ' m a lot more comfortable with the idea of a father being able to legally opt out if there ' s a sufficient support system in place so that the child ' s mother can raise the child without assistance from the father - even if she chooses not to . 	0
OC	5239	But it ' s not particularly relevant here unless one takes the attitude that child support is supposed to be either compensation for , or an equivalent " punishment " to , pregnancy , and I don ' t see how one can reconcile that attitude with feminism . 	0
OC	5240	And as for calling folks on things , it depends on the situation . 	0
OC	5241	I think the bringing up of " pregnancy is so dangerous " may simply have been a context failure . 	1
OC	5242	I typically see that argument used in the context of pro-choice or childfree advocacy , and he may have just internalized that as " the feminist position . " 	0

OC	5811	i don ' t think they are idiots because they don ' t agree with me . i think they are idiots because their premises alienate and destroy . 	1
OC	5812	i don ' t care who the person is , if they have republican beliefs ( such as unregulated corporations , independence at the expense of the community , free market capitalism ) and more specifically social conservative beliefs ( such as being opposed homosexual marriage and social programs and believing in a version of family values based on twisted theology ) then i believe their beliefs are selfish , ignorant , and exceedingly adverse . 	0

OC	5821	If there is such a thing as memes ( and the theory ' s proponents say that they are things ) , then this is the meme equivalent of engineering weapons-grade strains of the Bird Flu . 	0
OC	5822	I think if you set out by saying , " Hey guys , I am starting this new meme , " then it is definitely not a meme . 	0
OC	5823	It ' s like infecting someone with a disease on purpose and saying they " caught " it . 	0
OC	5824	And if you don ' t agree it ' s only because the meme that makes you think otherwise is a strong one . 	0
OC	5825	But , anyway , yeah . 	0
OC	5826	Well , I actually don ' t much care for the term in general , as it means engaging with a corner of philosophy of the mind that I find a little silly . 	1
OC	5827	In its stronger forms , meme theory suggests that there ' s no such thing as human consciousness or thought because our brains are just spongy , meme-infested piles of goop . 	0

OC	6088	I ' m sorry to go off on you - I ' m just so angry at Americans for writing , and for Paul McCartney ' s photo op in PEI . 	0
OC	6089	In this case , polar bears , which used to be numerous in Newfoundland and Labrador , and NWT kept the seals down , but since they ' re on the extinction list . . . they haven ' t been doing alot lately . 	0
OC	6090	The number of seals has actually doubled since the 70s . . . and do you know how much they eat ? 	0
OC	6091	They would populate themselves into famine if left unchecked . 	0
OC	6092	I used to be against it , until I had to study the fisheries and now I get that though many animals are cute , and these are the ones I don ' t like seeing killed ( seals , deers , rabbits , kangaroos ) that sometimes it is necessary . 	1
OC	6093	I don ' t want to get argumentative on LJ , but why don ' t you agree with the seal hunt ? 	0
OC	6094	Do you agree with hunting deer ? 	0
OC	6095	Culling cat and dog populations by neutering ? 	0
OC	6096	The unfortunate truth is that we ' ve killed off many of the predators that kept seal populations in check ( like we did with deer and moose , etc ) . 	0

OC	6119	I ' m not sure I ' d sign on to the Marxist part of your definition of radical feminist . 	1
OC	6120	That only describes a fraction of the overall group . 	0
OC	6121	In Germany , single motherhood is less common than in the U . S . - people are less delusional about sex and birth control . 	0
OC	6122	But up until recently , anyway , going on welfare as a single mother was not terribly stigmatized . 	0
OC	6123	The German social safety net has been progressively undermined over the past few years , so I have to think that this option is getting harder - they have a lot more emphasis on working to earn one ' s benefits , which is obviously a problem if you have little ones . 	0
OC	6124	( Germany ' s public daycare system is also being slowly de-funded . ) 	0
OC	6125	Sunflower , you were in Canada when you had your babies , yes ? 	0
OC	6126	Because as jfpbookworm points out , the supports are awfully thin here in the U . S . The only reason men get stuck with child support is that society as a whole isn ' t willing to support children of single parents . 	1
OC	6127	At least in Canada , you ' re covered for health care . 	0

OC	6145	At least with girls , all you have to do is get them something shiny or something that smells good and they will be happy : ) Those pictures of the twins with their dog just made me melt < 333 Nothing is more attractive than a guy who is not afraid to show his love for his pets : ) Good luck catching up on your Christmas stuff . 	0

OC	6150	WTF Are you going ? ! 	0
OC	6151	You can ' t really have that kind of set-up though , but a small office might get you pretty close . . . 	0
OC	6152	In a small office where my boss is my dad and I know the accountant pretty well , and I talk to the same fifteen subcontractors on the phone , it ' s not an overly social environment like most other jobs I ' ve had have been ( which is probably the main reason I don ' t have a rapidly developing ulcer right now ) , so I don ' t have to be that outgoing . 	0
OC	6153	About the job thing , I ' ve always just faked outgoing-ness . 	0
OC	6154	It ' s just all so out of control . 	0
OC	6155	I ' ve been listening to news less lately , too . 	0

OC	6168	" Nope--can ' t happen to me . . . " 	0
OC	6169	Well , maybe it ' s something about winter that causes these attempted thieves to lose 30 IQ points , and think they can steal that copper without getting that electric chair effect . 	1

OC	6184	Christianist lawmaking harms both the law and Christianity . 	0
OC	6185	The variety of " Christian " that would go around trying to codify the exclusivity of their beliefs into law has no more respect for atheists than it does for gays . 	0

OC	6390	I grant you there ' s a certain amount of urban sniffery in those two perspectives on thot of truth in th my pserspective there ' s also a lot of truth in what they say that most people jibbering madly about the movie just don ' t want to deal with . 	0

OC	6479	But you should be able to follow this link and get a page with a link to YepRoc ' s Goodnight Oslo page , which has an audio stream of the record . 	0
OC	6480	Hm , well YepRoc ' s site is not online right now . 	0
OC	6481	maybe it ' s not that they didn ' t want to fuck you before , but just feel safer telling you once you ' re in a relationship and they can ' t really act on it ? 	1
OC	6482	it may just be fear . 	0

OC	6485	        For the record : I haven ' t seen it , so I really have no opinion as of yet ; however I ' m probably gonna wait on this one - - I ' m just not a fan of Westerns .   Even though its really a movie about sheepherders .   Technically . 	0
OC	6486	It is streamable from YepRoc - - matter of fact I should update the post with a link to that . 	0
OC	6487	Wow , you didn ' t know ? 	0
OC	6488	I ' m so happy you ' ve decided as such . 	0
OC	6489	This is a great , great record . 	1
OC	6490	I keep hearing people say things like " best record since Element of Light " and " Best Record since I Often Dream of Trains " - - I ' m hesitant to say that kind of thing because I ' m not a critic ; but it is certainly in a league with Robyn ' s very best work . 	0
OC	6491	* Waves energetically * Bye , Emo Hobo Joe ! 	0
OC	6492	I mean , when we were doing the play , he danced me around stage because I was the nearest person there , and he sang " Roxane " with gusto . 	0

OC	6495	sadly i have friends that have the knowledge to ruin me , just talking about things i ' ve done / said . 	0
OC	6496	i ' m afraid someone is going to reveal something terrible about me that only people i ' ve known for years know . 	0
OC	6497	I ' ll have to ask Fay how she cooked their rooster - he turned out very tasty . 	1
OC	6498	What I take offense at is the suggestion there ' s something wrong with me for disliking the story ( and presumably by extension , the movie . ) 	0
OC	6499	Note that I ' m talking about the response to my opinion of this particular work in the aggregate , not necessarily or specifically yours . 	0
OC	6500	Whether or not the word " love " gets used or not , clearly there ' s supposedly passion in the story . . . but what does it do ? 	0
OC	6501	I take offense at the insinuation that I ' m some kind of traitor to the " Gay Cause " for thinking the story sucks and that the hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE . 	1
OC	6502	Passion moves fucking mountains and surmounts daunting difficulties . 	0
OC	6503	It ' s like getting a huge verbal buildup for a fireworks display that turns out to be a guy waving a couple of sparklers . 	0
OC	6504	And no , the story needn ' t have a " happy ending " in order to be satisfying . 	0
OC	6505	This story just kind of staggers around for a while then falls over . 	0

OC	6518	What ' s really pissing me off is watching a liberal reporter tour damaged areas of Lebanon with a representative of Hezbollah while he whines about what the Israelis are doing to their cities . 	1
OC	6519	WTF ? 	0
OC	6520	Maybe if your rag-headed leader hadn ' t ordered the invasion of Israel , and the kidnapping of troops they wouldn ' t be shelling the fuck out of your little hidey holes , which happen to be in civilian areas . 	0
OC	6521	Cowardly fucks . 	0
OC	6522	And the reporter is eating it up , when he should be kicking the fucker ' s ass for assuming the rest of the world is as stupid as they are . 	0
OC	6523	Oh , and the whiney ass , self-centered , American bitch that couldn ' t understand why she wasn ' t being evacuated immediately . 	0
OC	6524	" The Italians , and French got their people out . 	0

OC	6556	I ' ve just been tussling with that particularly poisonous variety of " feminist ally " , a Knight in Shining Armor . 	0
OC	6557	I ' d like to say I took him apart , but , while I believe I acquitted myself very well , I fear he missed the point altogether , and flounced with his complacence and his virtuously noble self-image unscathed . 	0
OC	6558	When I deal with them , I sound for all the world like a stereotypical grim-and-strident radical feminist - out come phrases like " sexist entitlement " and " male privilege " . 	0
OC	6559	Nope , I ' m definitely not a Fun Feminist when it comes to that . 	0
OC	6560	A Knight in Shining Armor is the sort of male self-described feminist ( or he may describe himself as a feminist ally , or some other term chosen to show that of course he ' d never usurp our movement - this one favors " radical pro-feminist " ) who is involved with feminism because he ' s Good and Noble , and will slay all the evil misogynistic patriarchal villains and make the world safe for womankind . 	0

OC	6612	I just recently learned that Sikhism is an offshoot of Hinduism . 	0

OC	6698	I know that many animators have been pushing for some kind of official rerelease just because the segments with Brer Rabbit are just damn good animation , but otherwise it wasn ' t hugely financially or critically successful and really didn ' t quite fit next to other live action / animation hybrid family films like Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks on the Disney Classics shelves . 	0

OC	6887	- Sunflower If I ' m reading my feminist history aright , that ' s right on the historic fracture point between liberal feminism and radical feminism ; liberal feminism preferred to address injustices by adjusting the existing paradigms , while radical feminism believed it was necessary to examine , and work to change , the paradigm itself . 	1

VG	7979	There are two real reason I started a couple of forums and they are both related to my former addiction to alcohol . 	0
VG	7980	The above is really some background first off . 	0
VG	7981	However when the problem took hold , the demise to my job and my health also began . 	0
VG	7982	Prior to having a problem I was a UK highly respected IT Consultant and was very successful . 	0
VG	7983	My health had suffered to the point where any job that I used to do was impossible as I am not allowed to drive due to seizures . 	0
VG	7984	Since getting over it nearly a year and a half ago now I had to decide what to do . 	0
VG	7985	The first was to find something to do with an aweful lot of spare time and to make some money ( cant live on freah air ) and so the original Parkweb Oracle site was launched and although it wasnt the kind of money I was used to it is enough to comfortable survive . 	1
VG	7986	But like I said 2 reasons . 	0
VG	7987	I wanted to give a little back to all of the people that helped me and stood by me through my addiction - I made a promise to them all when I was back on my feet so to speak I would do something to try and make a difference . 	0

VG	7990	Hence it can be maintained that the nationalization of a concern , or even of a whole industrial branch , is not a socialistic measure since the rest of the economy continues to be based on the principle of private initiative and of the market economy since the nationalized branch is itself subject to the discipline of the market , particularly by paying its way by means of sales rather than by means of subsidies from the state . 	1
VG	7991	The only point we want to stress is that , between a socialized economy and one certain branches of which have been nationalized , there is more than a quantitative difference . 	0

VG	7994	Thus initiating military action against Iraq is not a simple matter of honouring clear treaty obligations ( as in 1939 ; the case can be made , though with some awkwardness , for the first Gulf conflict ) , nor of rebutting direct aggression , territorial or economic or whatever , against ourselves . 	1
VG	7995	Strategy reorganised itself around a balance of terror , Mutually Assured Destruction . 	0
VG	7996	The post-Cold War period may have seen the dissolution of this strategic assumption ; but it has not taken us back to the age when nation states fought territorial campaigns . 	0
VG	7997	Hiroshima was the start of a process leading to the development of weaponry that made territorial struggles irrelevant . 	0
VG	7998	The long-distance delivery of weapons of mass destruction altered the character of war itself . 	0
VG	7999	The fact that the war was finally won in the East by tactics that had nothing to do with this ( the atomic bomb ) doesn ' t alter the circumstances in which the war began . 	0
VG	8000	It might , though , make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different . 	0
VG	8001	On the first aspect : the conflict that we undertook ( rightly , I believe ) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory . 	0
VG	8002	Both sides could ( and did ) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment ; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert , the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance . 	0

VG	8867	Donald Page , one of America ' s eminent cosmologists , has calculated the odds of our universe existing as on the order of one chance out of 1010 ( 123 ) , a number which is so inconceivable that to call it astronomical would be a wild understatement ! { 9 } Robert Jastrow , the head of NASA ' s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , has called this the most powerful evidence for the existence of God " ever to come out of science . " { 10 } Once again , the view that Christian theists have always held , that there is an intelligent designer of the Cosmos , seems to me to be much more plausible than the atheistic interpretation of chance . 	0

WTP	9529	The article should mention that Smith said he saw God and Jesus and that seems to me to be appropriate . 	0
WTP	9530	The phrasing of the source Rockgenre provided isn ' t really clear either way , although from the context the author seems to be arguing that System of a Down is an atypical nu metal band , not that they aren ' t nu metal . 	0

WTP	9631	It bothers me because it ' s far too specific for this article . 	0
WTP	9632	On occasion , yes Hamas has said that , though they also have said they would accept a state within the Green line in exchange for a long term truce . 	0
WTP	9633	Im sure we could find a way to clarify the meaning of what it is they fight for . 	0

WTP	9641	I strongly suggest using an image from a war that didn ' t involve America ( the graves from the American civil war is enough ) and preferably one from long enough ago that it won ' t cause any edit disputes - the Mongol invasions for example . 	0
WTP	9642	I don ' t think it ' s a valid point that it ' s small - would it be okay to have a thumbnail of a detailed photograph of two people enthusiastically copulating on the sexual intercourse article if you couldn ' t see their genitalia in the thumbnail ? 	1

WTP	9650	When pseudoscientists are considered " skeptical " , then we are in the land of pseudoskepticism . 	0
WTP	9651	When believers in " pseudoscience " ( = fake science ) show " skepticism " of mainstream positions and science , they are often engaging in pseudoskepticism ( = fake skepticism ) . 	0

WTP	9653	That would be a total twisting of the idea behind this list . 	0
WTP	9654	It must not become a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience by pseudoskeptical groups and individuals " . 	0
WTP	9655	That is not what the inclusion criteria specify , and since this is what ' s happening here , we need to strengthen the inclusion criteria so it doesn ' t happen again . 	0
WTP	9656	That doesn ' t mean that even Scientology might not have some legitimate criticims , but ( 1 ) they just can ' t be trusted on this matter , and ( 2 ) they don ' t qualify as a source according to our inclusion criteria . 	0

WTP	9662	For as many users who want to portray Hamas in a " good light " there are many more users who want to try and portray them in a " bad light " , and too few who just want to say who they are and what they do and not put their own spin on it . 	0

WTP	9664	I am one of many editors - not just Roland - who believe that this article must distinguish clearly between evolution as fact ( e . g . measurable changes in the the descendents of hawthorne flies ) versus evolution as theory ( a set of concepts for understanding how and why these changes are occuring , and why they are important ) . 	0
WTP	9665	Yes , facts are constituted through scientific consensus ( see Latour and Woolgar ´ s superb ethnography , Laboratory Life ) . 	0
WTP	9666	The reason for this apparent dispute is that Slicky is not using English very precisely . 	1
WTP	9667	Moreover , Slicky muddied the waters by naming General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics as facts . 	0
WTP	9668	But this is an inadequate ( necessary but insufficient ) definition of " fact " as it is true of paradigms as well . 	0
WTP	9669	They are theories or paradigms which themselves depend on certain facts . 	0
WTP	9670	they are not . 	0
WTP	9671	That both depend on scientific consensus does not make them the same , it only means they have ( at least ) one point of congruity . 	0

WTP	10114	A second point is the first sentence of the article . 	0
WTP	10115	I would suggest something like : " The Roman Catholic Church , more officially termed the Catholic Church … " 	1
WTP	10116	Assuming that the article title remains Roman Catholic Church , the first sentence still needs changing in order to be less misleading , and even offensive to some Catholics . 	1
WTP	10117	The problem here is that what has become the current construction implies ( wrongly ) that the official name of the Church is the Roman Catholic Church , and Catholic Church is an unofficial term . 	0
WTP	10118	The most recent edit has put : " The Catholic Church , often referred to by protestants as the Roman Catholic Church . . . " 	0
WTP	10119	I too am a musician , though I admittedly doubt that I ' m as studied as you say you are . 	0
WTP	10120	Neither that , nor the " friends and teachers " thing are particularly relevant here , however , as you still only seem to be talking about personal opinion . 	0
WTP	10121	If you want paragraphs about Sabbath at the beginning of an article , go to the Black Sabbath article . 	0
WTP	10122	This article is about heavy metal in general , and saying Sabbath is more important than Zeppelin and Deep Purple is utterly unverifiable . 	0
WTP	10123	What ' s more , anyone could easily shoot that argument down by pointing out that Zeppelin was doing it before Sabbath , and had even more commercial success . 	0
WTP	10124	In general articles , the information provided is more general and less specific . 	0
WTP	10125	In more specific articles , more specific information is appropriate . 	0

WTP	10127	Not in this article . 	0
WTP	10128	No , not at the level of detail you are proposing . 	0
WTP	10129	Anyway , there ' s an alternate image of a pro-life gathering . 	0
WTP	10130	That said , my own personal concern for the pictures is the unintended Amerocentrism ; it would be nice to to have capture an image of activists in the abortion debate in another country . 	0
WTP	10131	Also , the current pair of pictures create a thematic juxtaposition , centred about two Washington landmarks . 	0
WTP	10132	For reference , my input is that she be listed R&B , reggae , pop , rock . 	0
WTP	10133	After all , " size isn ' t everything , " and many gatherings are considerably smaller affairs than the March for Life or March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
WTP	10134	I don ' t think that the relevancy of an issue can be judged from the apparent turnout in a picture of an isolated protest . 	1
WTP	10135	Another user above expressed the concern that the younger age of the pro-life demonstrators in the photo makes the pro-choice cause appear less current . 	0
WTP	10136	I think the issue is one of scale : the pro-life demonstration is by Bound for Life , a grassroots organization , while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
WTP	10137	Saying he " dictated " the Book of Mormon is a fairly neutral representation of what Smith did , and it takes no position on whether he was " translating " in a scientific sense , receiving text by revelation , or making it up as he went , all 3 of which are theoretically possible . 	1
WTP	10138	Highlighting one of those options or opinions , that it was " translated by the gift and power of God " , is not that important in the context of the sentence as a whole . 	0
WTP	10139	That claim can be and is covered elsewhere . 	0
WTP	10140	Plus it ' s just more wordy and doesn ' t flow as well as the original text . 	0
WTP	10141	I ' m having a very hard time seeing why the first would be preferable . 	1
WTP	10142	It seems to engage in subtle puffery , what with the " over 500 pages . . . in about 60 days " statement . 	0
WTP	10143	Why is this important to the statement ? 	0
WTP	10144	From my view , it ' s not , really . 	0
WTP	10145	Before that it was a patchwork of a wide variety of different forms of political entities ( some were countries in their own right ) . 	0

WTP	10153	That will get the " magic number " for GA ; but it should probably only be done if someone also feels it will improve the article . 	0
WTP	10154	If something needs to be sacrificed at the Good Article altar , my suggestion is that we reduce the epidemiological information ( much of paragraph 3 ) to about a sentence , and combine it with paragraph 4 . 	1
WTP	10155	Specifically , those who assert that it is too long should state what information there is superfluous or in some way detracts from the goal of the lede being a readable overview . 	0
WTP	10156	Therefore any criticism of its length should be based on content rather than an arbitrary number . 	0
WTP	10157	What the lede needs to be is a concise , readable overview of the article . 	0
WTP	10158	As for , # 1 : no , the lede doesn ' t need to be reduced to four paragraphs : four paragraphs is suggested as a guideline , with exceptions . 	1

WTP	10161	In my wake , you ' re making it sound like I was some raving manic voice of dissent . 	0
WTP	10162	The soft parts can be compared to the soft parts of an Opeth or Tool song ( both bands two prominent prog metal bands , heavily influenced by Sabbath and especially this album with its innovative heavy / soft approach ) , which , also , hold no blues influences . 	0
WTP	10163	They contain no blues influences at all , basically , and your already stated example is , as said , very poor . 	0
WTP	10164	The softer parts are soft ; neither the chord progressions , the song melodies , the guitar licks , or anything , contain any clear blues influences . 	0
WTP	10165	I wouldn ' t accept that sentence , among other reasons because Hamas is also fighting against the Israeli occupation of what we call Israel , which is not Palestinian land . 	1
WTP	10166	I would propose just taking a sentence from Encarta or Britannica . 	0
WTP	10167	I think it is important for the article to state this percentage to put the scandal in perspective . 	0
WTP	10168	The students were extremely surprised and relieved to know this fact . 	0
WTP	10169	If we are to mention the sex scandals in the lead , my suggestion would be to also include a percentage of total priests accused . 	0
WTP	10170	It is very unfair to all of the faithful , hardworking and self-sacrificing priests out there who are suffering from this misconception and my heart really hurts for them . 	0
WTP	10171	The church response and reforms were not covered by the press hardly at all and I think the aricle serves the public interest by making that known . 	0
WTP	10172	Reasons why I think sex scandals should be mentioned in the lead : I think the article ' s section covering the sex abuse scandal is one of the most important ones because of the recent controversy and press coverage over it . 	1
WTP	10173	In the Archdiocese of Miami the number was 1% of all priests who had worked here since 1950 . 	0
WTP	10174	In my religious education class , I asked the students what percentage of priests they thought had been accused of sexual misconduct and I got answers ranging from 30-50% . 	0
WTP	10175	Catholics have been persecuted more often than they have persecuted - all of these events are notable and relevent to the history of the Church and have been mentioned and wikilinked in the article as such . 	0
WTP	10176	This is not POV , this is following Wikipedia guidelines . 	0
WTP	10177	We cant say that an article is POV just because many instances of persecutions of Catholics are mentioned in greater number than persecutions by Catholics . 	1
WTP	10178	The facts of history bear out the fact that is how it is . 	0
WTP	10179	We can ' t eliminate those facts from the article without violating FA rules that require us to make mention of notable events . 	0
WTP	10180	Just as the Inquisitions are mentioned and the facts relating to the persecution of heretics is provided , so we have given equal treatment to all other persecutions relevant to the Catholic Church . 	0
WTP	10181	I would like to elaborate further on how this article is NPOV . 	0
WTP	10182	The facts regarding the persecutions of Catholics in England , Ireland and Wales are relevant facts that speak directly about the Catholic Church - how it was banned in those areas and people who resisted were dealt with in a particular way - persecutions . 	0
WTP	10183	If the article was not referenced to the top sources required by Wikipedia we could argue this but no one has offered a view of Catholic history different than what we have provided on the current page - even though I have searched for one in my diligent efforts to satisfy Karanacs . 	0

WTP	10220	where ' s the controversy ? 	0
WTP	10221	And if we ' re talking about the Spanish Inquisition , and giving figures , then it is important to note that most of the Inquisition killings occurred in a twenty year period when the Inquisition was run by Torquemada and it was involved in the campaign against supposed false Moorish conversos under Ferdinand and Isabella . 	0
WTP	10222	Pope SIxtus condemned the Spanish Inquisitions procedures at this time , but was brow-beaten by Ferdinand into saying nothing more . 	0
WTP	10223	It could imply thst everyone tsken in by the inquisition was killed . 	0
WTP	10224	In fact the 3-4 , 000 figure is across the Spanish Empire , and over a period of 400 years . 	0
WTP	10225	As Kamen said , most local district courts in Europe executed far more people than the entire Spanish Inquisition over the period 1520 - 1820 . 	0
WTP	10226	wasn ' t this a big deal when the elections were going on ? 	0

WTP	10353	I have a feeling that , as easily as it can be sourced , would not fly . 	0
WTP	10354	My sentence , including the word terrorist would be as follows : " Hamas is a resistance organization that fights against Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands . 	0
WTP	10355	Well thanks for accepting that part of my position , but ID only answered half of the question asked . 	0
WTP	10356	I specifically said " a resistance organization fighting Israeli occupation " . 	0
WTP	10357	Would you like to propose a sentence that we can take a look at ? 	0
WTP	10358	( undent ) Hi Wassup . 	0
WTP	10359	It has a military wing , the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades , that has carried out terrorist attacks to further that resistance " . 	0
WTP	10360	But I doubt that would be accepted . 	0
WTP	10361	Strongly suggest you write an article about the sex scandals , if one doesn ' t exist . 	0
WTP	10362	Don ' t try to hide the facts of what they do . 	0
WTP	10363	Your last comment simply shows your POV , being a Hamas apologist . 	0
WTP	10364	Instead of choosing military targets , they target civilians , in order to terrorize the population to get what they want . 	0
WTP	10365	They choose to pursue their cause by murdering civilians , with no military use . 	0
WTP	10366	As I ' ve explained , their method of willful , intentional killing of civilians is the most salient and important detail about them . 	1
WTP	10367	I didn ' t say " Hamas is a terrorist organization " ( though it is ) , but that it employs clear-cut terrorist tactics , which is 100% true and accurate , and not open to interpretation . 	0
WTP	10368	My position is to NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THEM -U . S . , israel , Hamas , PLO , South Africa , Canada , etc . It ' s not a secret that politicians lie … . . 	0
WTP	10369	are you really that naive , or do you have ulterior motives for trying to paint Hamas as a " terrorist organization " ? 	0
WTP	10370	There is also the [ CSICOP article ] , The book ' Pseudoscience in Biological Psychiatry : Blaming the body ' , reviewed in NEJM . 	0
WTP	10371	There is also a section in ' Anti-psychiatry ' named Psychiatry as a pseudo-science replete with its own sources . 	0
WTP	10372	I must have missed the part in your response where you refuted my legal connection between the governing bodies of the U . S . / israel / Hamas - They are all democratically elected ( by international standards ) governing bodies and are currently in states of war and are ALL committing legitimate and illegitimate actions , and therefore . 	0
WTP	10373	@ " Okedem " I ' m sorry . . . . 	0
WTP	10374	Therefore , I repeat again , can you tell me why it is fair , balanced and logical to include the " terrorist " comment on the " Hamas " wiki page ( in the initial description ) whereas it is apparently not on the " U . S . " and " israel " wiki page ? 	0
WTP	10375	should be treated equally . 	0
WTP	10376	( and please don ' t refer me to the comments made by U . S . and israeli politicians claiming that the FAR greater civilian deaths caused by their governments are " by accident " . . . . . . because we ' re not supposed to believe Hamas ' claims . . . . . but we ' re supposed to believe U . S . / israeli claims ? ? ? 	0
WTP	10377	Could you please explain your reasoning that logically leads you to make this claim ? 	0
WTP	10378	What ' s so misleading or scary about that ? 	0
WTP	10379	The first sentence of this section sounds awkward ( ask an editor who is not involved with WP and has no axe to grind about HIV ) and seems to bend over backwards to deny that anyone with any kind of biological credentials could possibly believe anything is missing from the current theory . 	0
WTP	10380	I agree , what happened to mentioning those three topics ? 	0
WTP	10381	And why are we still using the non-Catholic word " pro-life " ( consistent life ethic may work better ) . 	0
WTP	10382	I ' m also concerned that the reason the Church opposed some forms of contraception isn ' t because condoms kill babies , but because of their view on sex and marriage . - 	0
WTP	10383	She is a medical physicist . 	0
WTP	10384	That said , let me also say that I reviewed various WP guidelines as prodded . 	0
WTP	10385	Let me start by saying I made a mistake in regard to " researchers " . 	1
WTP	10386	I had assumed from the journal citation in this section that Papadopulos was an HIV researcher . 	0
WTP	10387	It simply summarizes various viewpoints , providing a lot of nuance about why some scientists suspect cofactors , why some HIV-positive people refused treatment and then got it , why some doctors no longer deny HIV ' s role but still think something ' s incomplete . 	0
WTP	10388	So , I don ' t see a problem with POZ as a source to * report opinions * , which is basically what the first part of this section is doing , is it not ? 	1
WTP	10389	Secondary sources are actually preferable ( to my surprise ) , mainly because of usability and ease of checking . 	0
WTP	10390	POZ does not claim to be a scientific article ! 	0
WTP	10391	NPA , Ec5618 . 	0
WTP	10392	That said , Ros , there is strong precedence against shock images on this article ( Archive 14 , " Link to ' Aborted Children ' " , Archive 16 , " Linking to Images is Allowed " , Archive 20 , " Abortion Images / Links " . 	1
WTP	10393	Such images , in the context of the politically-charged Abortion article , would be more argumentative than informative — a violation of WP : NPOV . 	0
WTP	10394	- 	0
WTP	10395	I did watch the National Geographic special , and had exactly that thought . 	0
WTP	10396	The researchers ' stronger case is argued from the other direction . 	1
WTP	10397	The Sea People are assumed to have had the most impact on the coasts . 	0
WTP	10398	The current coastal people are genetically highly similar to their inland neighbors . 	0
WTP	10399	This misses the point . 	0
WTP	10400	In order to determine that a given population ' s genetic pool lacks a significant contribution from some other given population , one needs to know first what characterizes the genes of that other population - - in this case , the " Sea People . " 	0
WTP	10401	This is what " Tomer " means by knowing who they were . 	0
WTP	10402	As the genetic character of the Sea People cannot be be determined , screening definitively for it seems impossible . 	1
WTP	10403	Therefore it is unlikely the coastal people interbred with any outsiders to a greater degree than the inland people did . 	0
WTP	10404	While stronger , that still isn ' t a lock . 	1
WTP	10405	The tag ( s ) seem to have been removed ( probably correctly ) because the reasons for adding the tag are no applicable to the tag , or are unarticulated ( or poorly articulated ) or discussed and removed - much like many other articles in WP in fact . 	0
WTP	10406	Just because people disagree with the article doesn ' t mean it needs a tag . 	0
WTP	10407	At one time the point was to put priests on par with doctors , lawyers , etc . I ' ve been told that it has been loosened up in various dioceses , states , countries , etc . Some seminaries in the midwest are even non-accredited . 	0
WTP	10408	It may be more of the local Ordinary than Canon Law . - - 	0
WTP	10409	I know things have changed . 	1
WTP	10410	When I was in Seminary . . . it was 4 years of college seminary and 2-3 years post-graduate . 	0
WTP	10411	Anyway , it isn ' t on-topic here and would be better suited to inclusion at Domestic rabbit if anywhere . 	1
WTP	10412	I agree . 	0

WTP	10420	We also have studies that show that adhd medication offers no benefit over behavior management and counseling after 36 months [ 4 ] . 	0
WTP	10421	I think it is a valid item on the list as per the inclusion criteria . 	0
WTP	10422	I think for the most part that the criticism against Psychiatry is actually against ' bio chemical ' psychiatry or Biopsychiatry . 	0
WTP	10423	Broader there are studies that show that antidepressants have only limited benefit over placebo [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] . 	0
WTP	10424	Indeed there was a broad consensus , but to be more precise , it was to make the title NPOV and to bring it into harmony with the existing inclusion criteria and existing contents . 	0
WTP	10425	The title was the only problem . 	0

WTP	10435	I am very afraid that if it is not included in the lead , if this article ever reaches the main page there will be scads of people trying to put that into the lead for you . 	0
WTP	10436	It would be much better to find a good , NPOV to portray the controversies ( such as the single sentence that mentions all of the issues that I think Nancy quoted above ) rather than wait for the masses to put in heaven-only-knows-what nonsense . 	1
WTP	10437	The child abuse scandals , or the RCC ' s positions on homosexuality , abortions , and euthanasia , are controversies that are well known outside of the RCC . 	0
WTP	10438	The child abuse scandals are also not strictly a US issue , although the article does not do a good job of pointing that out . 	0
WTP	10439	Summorum Pontificum is a controversy that is relatively confined to the Church faithful - few people outside of the RCC have heard of it or would really consider it a controversy . 	0
WTP	10440	By all means mention it in the lead if you choose , but I believe the more recent controversies need a single line in the lead as well . 	1
WTP	10441	Yes , unfortuently just about all of the article needs improving . 	0

WTP	10501	News paper evidence here of the First Vision ' s presence in young Smith ' s community ( and pre-1900 ' s Mormonism ) is relevant because it allows the reader a better opportunity to understand the basis of Mormonism for themselves . 	0
WTP	10502	In conclusion , as much as I appreciate your willingness to help me not feel discouraged to present items to the article , I would appreciate it more if pro-LDS Scholars and evidence were not automatically dismissed . 	0
WTP	10503	An anonymous editor has made some big changes , reorganising the Community section an adding new material . 	0
WTP	10504	It isn ' t vandalism , and I can ' t argue with the validity of the changes , but they do lengthen the article and some of the material is a little too detailed IMO . 	0
WTP	10505	Rarranging the article without consultation is also problematic in that it is being groomed for FA submission . 	1
WTP	10506	Both matters again raise the issue of semi-protection for the article , which would have the benefit of making editors contactable for the purpose of discussion . 	0

WTP	10512	A real person can be " legendary " . 	0
WTP	10513	" Legendary " and " historical " do not show that Santa is a fable , a myth . 	1
WTP	10514	While we cannot ignore the historical underpinnings of the character , we cannot - with respect to those who believe wholeheartedly in the Flying Fat Man - escape that the wacky stories and abilities attributed to the fellow are beyond those of mortal men . 	0
WTP	10515	Much like the aforementioned example of the Easter Bunny , Santa is a mythical character . 	1
WTP	10516	However , the greater part of the character is fantastical , with enough powers and abilities to make Superman envious . 	0
WTP	10517	1 Santa has a roughly factual grounding with some embellishment , like Abe Lincoln or Johnny Appleseed ; this makes the character legendary . 	0
WTP	10518	An endorsement of LDS theology like this is not acceptable under the WP : NPOV rule . 	0
WTP	10519	In addition , whether or not the AAF is a reliable source is not the question--the issue is whether or a link to their website is a reliable source . 	0
WTP	10520	I am guessing no one is up for that . 	0
WTP	10521	Therefore , I think that mythological is the best we are going to get , when the clear alternative would be to scientifically dismiss the character as an indigestion-inspired hallucination ( " more gravy than grave to it " , to paraphrase Scrooge ) . 	0
WTP	10522	As to citing the LDS website , such citations are generally only appropriate in order to document official LDS positions or perspectives . 	0
WTP	10523	To show the " truth " of something , it is more problemmatic , and you would want to cite something that has been peer reviewed . 	0
WTP	10524	I don ' t think it is , because we know nothing about the editorial process and any peer review other than the fact that the web page was " compiled by [ unnamed ] AAF editors " . 	1
WTP	10525	If the AAF publishes in a peer reviewed journal , then we would want to cite that journal . 	0
WTP	10526	I am not claiming that it * is * pseudoscience , what I am stating is the fact that it has been characterized as being unfalsifiable , if you do not believe that this then constitutes similitude with pseudoscience I suggest you go rewriting [ Falsifiability ] and [ scientific method ] then come back here . 	1
WTP	10527	There is no ' interpretation ' necessary beyond that which we all have to apply when experiencing our environment , but by all means let us know how you interpret his statement . 	0

WTP	10595	I don ' t feel that the incident yet deserves its own section , and sectioning it off in such a way would just encourage further recentism and tabloidesque details . 	1

WTP	10597	Bleh , then we don ' t need a picture in the Martyrdom section . 	0

WTP	10604	This page has 2 split off pages for his foreign policy , hence when splitting the page one must sumarise the info here . 	0
WTP	10605	I thus left an uncontroversial edit here and moved the controversy to the other pages . 	0
WTP	10606	( as someone else said above ) Also the lead was bigger than the section on foreign policy so i moved the stuff below to the section ( which is not a decent sized 2-3 para section ) . 	0
WTP	10607	No content was removed , and nothing controversial was inserted so i i dont think there should bea fight / edit war . 	1

WTP	10613	This discussion produced a secondary controversy over what is the " correct " translation of the quote . 	0
WTP	10614	Out of curiosity , are you at any stage going to find the sources that back up the assertion " The sources clearly state that they are not nu metal " or can we disregard that as bluster ? 	0

WTP	10620	The account by people who the Israeli media seem to accept as being close cousins , is that the maternal grandmother was a Jew who was married at first to a Jewish man who mistreated her . 	0

WTP	10622	Her daughter became Gaddafi ' s mother . 	0
WTP	10623	She ran away with a Muslim sheikh , converted to Islam . 	0
WTP	10624	In the days before the creation of Israel ( and the mass emigration of sephardic Jews from Islamic Arab countries to Israel ) it was not that unusual for a Sephardic Jewish woman to marry a Muslim man , and in fact , a Jewish ( or Christian ) woman would not be required to convert to Islam to marry a Muslim man under Islamic law ( though a Muslim woman many only marry a Muslim though she may marry a Muslim convert and a woman from another religion not considered a " people of the book " like Jews or Christians would have to convert before Islamic law will recognize the marriage ) . 	1
WTP	10625	Given the other account , that his mother converted to Islam at 9 years old , it may not be clear if his mother was from the grandmother ' s first marriage to the Jewish man or from the second marriage to the sheikh . 	0
WTP	10626	Apparently , according to the Israeli media , under Jewish halachic law , to be a Jew one must be born to a Jewish mother or convert to Judaism . 	1
WTP	10627	You are reading " psychoanalysis should not be generally characterized as pseudoscience " , which is in the text you cited . 	0
WTP	10628	If so , Gaddafi would meet the legal Islamic definition of being a Muslim , while also meeting the legal , Jewish , definition of being a Jew . 	1
WTP	10629	If born to a Jewish mother , you qualify as a Jew and at least some authorities maintain it does not matter if your mother--born Jewish--aposticizes and joins another religion . 	0
WTP	10630	I will have another look at Kamen today , and possibly make a few tweaks . 	0
WTP	10631	This article looks to me , a layman who has indirectly encountered research as a freelance editor , like a very detailed biological article that explains everything one would want to know about a virus . 	1
WTP	10632	It necessarily addresses consequences of infection , and it necessarily addresses secondary effects ( e . g . , loss of income , loss of parents ) , though I feel the latter should not be part of the lead . 	0
WTP	10633	HIV is mostly focused on the biology and nitty-gritty therein , AIDS has a broader focus like Aids # Society_and_culture . 	0

WTP	10635	The book cost me $120 plus shipping and is only available in Italian and Latin - I called several churches and two Catholic Church diocesan headquarters to see if they even had the book and no one had it . 	0

WTP	10637	I would appreciate the help of those interested in seeing an NPOV article and I invite Wassupwestcoast to help if he feels so strongly about the issue . 	0

WTP	10643	You mention only Living Colour . 	0
WTP	10644	You fail to take note that Power Metal is immensly popular in European countries , Japan and so forth . 	1
WTP	10645	Stratovarius , Helloween , HammerFall , Iced Earth , Rhapsody and Sonata Arctica , to name a few , have achieved varied degrees of succes and media exposure . 	0
WTP	10646	When does the nationality of a performer ever create a genre ? 	0
WTP	10647	Here ' s a practical example ; The sub-genre of Thrash Metal breaks out mid-80s , a mostly American phenomenon . 	0
WTP	10648	Yes there are others and I ' m aware of them but can you sit here and enumerate tons of bands described as Funk Metal ? 	0
WTP	10649	Even then , most of these bands fit into the Alternative Metal category as well , maybe even more so . EDIT : Also , there ' s an argument about breaking racial boundaires ? 	0
WTP	10650	Shortly after , a similar style emerges in Germany with common traits that differentiate it from its American counterparts . 	0

WTP	10655	It also needs to be stated at the beginning that the Church terms itself the " Catholic Church " See for example : http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/ 	1
WTP	10656	The point is that the Anglican Church does not officially term itself the Catholic Church and neither does the Orthodox Church , while the ( roman ) Catholic Church does do just that , and has done so from earliest times . 	0
WTP	10657	The term Roman Catholic Church is largely a construct of the reformation period , when other groups wanted to claim " catholicism " . 	0
WTP	10658	The " Old Catholic Church " is known as just that - although it is not very old . 	0
WTP	10659	While " Roman Catholic Church " may be acceptable for an article title to avoid confusion . 	0
WTP	10660	I see the Germans have a statue at the top of their entry ( perhaps understandable in their case ) . 	0
WTP	10661	There is no demarcation between pseudoscience so while you can clearly distinguish between physics and cryptozoology , you will still have have boundary issues . 	0
WTP	10662	I agree that this list should become List of pseudosciences and use WP : PSCI but note that there will always be grey : you cannot avoid it . 	1

WTP	10687	Purple ' s dismissal of blues is clear , but blues is still ever-present in every album , and they don ' t take a clear step away from it like Sabbath does in " Sabbath Bloody Sabbath " . 	0
WTP	10688	The other songs are a little more similar in heaviness , but it ' s important acknowledging that Paranoid is relatively light in Sabbath ' s music , while Highway Star is particularly heavy in Purple ' s . 	0
WTP	10689	" Burn " came later , and is kind of metal , but made when the genre already was established by Sabbath . 	0
WTP	10690	" Sweet Leaf " is groundbreaking in a groundbreaking album ; notice the riffing in between the verses , and the riffs after the guitar solo ; they are but a taste of what is a norm in metal music from then on ; the breaking of common scales , and heavy usage of alternative intervals , like semitones and the tritone . 	0
WTP	10691	So the bigger problem here is that the date of partition is wrong . 	0

WTP	10696	In Hungary , yes , but even Khanty and Mansi lie within Europe . 	0

WTP	10703	Our inclusion criteria define this article , not the title ( which was recently changed with explicit assurances that people would not immediately set in with pointed and disruptive additions ) . 	0
WTP	10704	Or , better yet , we might consider following WP : RS and require that our sources be " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " ( emphasis in original ) , with a little WP : WEIGHT thrown in to cover disagreement among sources . 	0
WTP	10705	With that out of the way , would anyone object to closing this thread , as it seems to be going nowhere ? 	0

WTP	10711	I just do not know where to put that info , even if I recognize it is important . 	0
WTP	10712	I also do not want to have an Article called Iruña Veleia about the hoax , because IV is an important archaelogical site and does not deserve that . 	1

WTP	10714	If someone is up to it , I find really interesant Oppenheimer opinions on the matter , about a " protobasque " family of languages starting in the iberian peninsula and south of france , just after the LGM and expanding through the repopulation of the british islands . 	0
WTP	10715	A history of Basque article would be cool , but a serious one requires far more time than I have . 	0

WTP	10747	Anyone certain of this ? 	0

WTP	10780	That would be more correct really and is not POV since there are no other churches that call itself the Catholic Church . 	0

WTP	10786	You are being patient and nice , and I appreciate that . 	0
WTP	10787	You directed me to a section of the NPOV policy dealing with undue weight , which exactly clarifies the point that I am making : " An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject , but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject . 	0
WTP	10788	Our argument is about what constitutes a notable controversy in a WP article on the Roman Catholic Church , and my position is that the sex abuse scandals don ' t make the cut because so many other controversies in the church are so much more notable . 	1
WTP	10789	Given the 2000 year history of the church , and all the things associated with the church , I ' d say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight , based on prominence of placement . 	1
WTP	10790	Note that undue weight can be given in several ways , including , but not limited to , depth of detail , quantity of text , prominence of placement , and juxtaposition of statements " ( emphasis added ) . 	0
WTP	10791	If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy ( and it is not clear to me that it does ) , I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal , although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church , and much more encyclopedia-worthy , to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum . 	0
WTP	10792	Like I said before , if it ' s necessary for FA , I ' m not going to stand in the way , but it looks to me like it violates several WP policies . 	0

WTP	10844	One thing to consider is that Joseph Smith declares that the dispensation that he proclaims is a restoration of the Truth , and for everyone else - - " all their creeds were an abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt " . 	0
WTP	10845	Either way , he said the word ' sect ' and so unless you have some clear evidence that it didn ' t mean sect , then it should say ' sect ' . 	1
WTP	10846	We can assume he knows no distinction and just switches terms constantly , or we can assume he deliberately chooses the terms . 	0
WTP	10847	So , Smith uses a lot of different terms back and forth . 	0
WTP	10848	In the lines leading up to the passage where Smith describes his experience in the official Joseph Smith-History from LDS , Smith uses various words to describe religion and religious things . 	0

WTP	10856	This is in the Judgment of the Court of Human Rights in the " Lawless v Ireland " case in 1961 which states on page 4 of the judgment in the " As to the Facts " section : " Under the Treaty establishing the Irish Free State , signed on 6th December 1921 between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State , six counties in the North of the Island of Ireland remained under British sovereignty . " 	0
WTP	10857	Considering that the case was defended by the then Attorney General of Ireland Aindrias Ó Caoimh one could reasonably expect the facts to be as viewed by the state itself . 	1
WTP	10858	Perhaps using that phrase would be preferable to any UK word use and you even have a decent reference to substantiate it and those are lawyers speaking . 	1
WTP	10859	I think it ' s important to recognize though that this is an area where potentially we might have compromised and - and arrived at a bill that dealt with the narrow concerns about how a - a previable fetus or child was treated by a hospital . 	0
WTP	10860	I recognize this is a passionate issue , and so I - I won ' t , as I said , belabor the point . 	0
WTP	10861	And if we ' re placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a previable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as - as is necessary to try to keep that child alive , then we ' re probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality . 	0
WTP	10862	Viability is the line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court to determine whether or not an abortion can or cannot take place . 	0
WTP	10863	The second reason that it would probably be found unconstitutional is that this essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a previable child , or fetus , however way you want to describe it . 	0
WTP	10864	For that purpose , I think it would probably be found unconstitutional . 	0
WTP	10865	It was . 	0
WTP	10866	I suggested to Members of the Judiciary Committee that it was unconstitutional and it would be struck down by the Seventh Circuit . 	0

WTP	10869	Tenacious misunderstandings are quite a bit more of a problem . 	0

WTP	11043	Agreed , we can ' t generalise Queen as heavy metal when they made a handful of songs vaguely related to the genre . 	1
WTP	11044	More often than not they made rock songs , progressive rock , pop influenced four-part vocal showcases , broadway style piano pieces etc . Second , the number of Metal bands being influenced by Queen ' s music doesn ' t make them Metal either , its misunderstanding the statement . 	1

WTP	11091	The editors here seem to have agreed to include a brief mention of the event , but not to give a blow-by-blow account of what happened , when , whose fault it was , and what all of the players - something that will likely never be relevant here because this is an article about the life and times of Barack Obama , not BP and its tribulations . 	0

WTP	11243	Now , logical assessment will lead you to conclude that this is just semantics and that countries committing the same acts as " terrorists " would also fall into the category of " terrorism " . . . . . . . . it ' s just that the U .

WTP	11245	Your next point : " Their designation had nothing to do with elections status . . . . . . . should not change due to the elections " Actually , if you check the U .

WTP	11313	So to recap , it seems like you need to explain how you ' re not running against WP : EL # ADV and WP : ELNO ' s # 4 , 10 , and 11 ; if you can ' t get any editors who regularly use Wikipedia to comment in your favour here , perhaps you should seek redress via Wikipedia : Third opinion as your last resort in getting this put to bed . 	0

WTP	11346	Indeed , I could complain about some parts of the article as it is , The section on the Reformation contains some highly critical comments : The most famous scholar of the age , Erasmus , in 1509 wrote In Praise of Folly which captured a widely held opinion about corruption in the church . [ 189 ] Abuses of power , usury , clerical wealth and hypocrisy all contributed to a general feeling among educated people that reform of some sort was necessary . [ 189 ] In 1517 , Martin Luther included his Ninety-Five Theses in a letter to several bishops , hoping to spark debate . [ 190 ] His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences . [ 190 ] Huldrych Zwingli , John Calvin , and others further criticized Catholic teachings . 	1
WTP	11347	These challenges developed into the Protestant Reformation . 	0
WTP	11348	I could object to some of this , Martin Luther inttended to spark more than debate when he posted his theses . 	0
WTP	11349	and there are none of the many negatives about him here ( anti-semitism , allowing bigamy , coercion , sanctining slaying of the peasants ) . 	0

WTP	11387	In regards to the back and forth here , I think the reasons for hesitation on inclusions of these types of things are legit , and Scjessey ' s response ( while it does look POVish ) is based on the fact that there were editors here wanting to included everything negative pushed at Obama during the first months of his presidency . 	1

WTP	11470	Rhythm & Blues is more historic , while contemporary R&B is 1980 ' s and beyond ( use of synth and other electronic production techniques ) . 	0
WTP	11471	I ' d also like to note that there obviously was hard rock before there was heavy metal ( though I ' m not absolute on whether or not Cream , Hendrix , and certain Kinks songs were considered such at the time ) , and early metal and hard rock / heavy metal acts were influenced by it . 	1

WTP	11485	The reason nobody is asking for a picture , is that there is no controversy surrounding donkey shows , and there are no advocacy groups constantly publishing biased articles and detail depictions of it . 	0
WTP	11486	The question is not that of appeasing you ( " i ' d be satisfied with very little . " ) , it is of educating the public in a neutral , and removed fashion . 	0
WTP	11487	I for one , vote NAY to the " detailed depiction proposal . " 	0
WTP	11488	Perhaps something from earlier history - even very ancient history , would be more appropriate , avoiding the problems of politics , over-attention to recent history ( there are three images related to recent wars involving America , any more than one is too many ) and preferably not so gruesome . 	0
WTP	11489	The image we had before , and I reverted the addition of this image once already , was Peter Fechter dying on the Berlin Wall , though that ' s from a period after the war had ended , so I ' d rather not use that as the ' final ' image for the section . 	1
WTP	11490	Would an image of a US marine shot dead in Iraq be considered equally appropriate for the article ? 	0
WTP	11491	Also think about this from a political view - Chinese people may be highly offended by the image . 	0
WTP	11492	It seems a little over the top - Wikipedia is not censored , but do we need to use such a gruesome image to prove a point ? 	0
WTP	11493	I tend to agree that this image is fairly disturbing - the body is partly decapitated and there are flies all over the head and torso . 	1
WTP	11494	While I understand the incident is being investigated , it is hard to believe that not even a small blurb about a pending domestic abuse incident involving Rihanna is not included in this article . 	0
WTP	11495	The fact that this article doesn ' t even have one blurb regarding the Chris Brown incident is pretty ridiculous . 	1
WTP	11496	I honestly don ' t understand why we keep talking about CCHR / Scientology , it is simply not needed in order to put biopsychiatry on the list per the current criteria . 	1
WTP	11497	Just like King George is important enough to have DOZENS of references in the Wiki article on the American Revolution and more reputable sites , ONE paragraph referencing the first vision isn ' t going to harm anything unless suppressing or distorting information is your goal . 	0

WTP	11529	Both Britannica and the Encarta articles on the Church do a better job of addressing the abuse scandal in the life of the Church . 	0
WTP	11530	The article as it is written states that the abuse is a recent U . S . anomaly while plenty of serious books written from both within the Church and without give another view . 	0
WTP	11531	That other view must be in this article for it to be NPOV . 	0

WTP	11533	I would not put Cartman ' s mom in the same class of characters as SKCK , even though she has often had as much screen-time as any one of thm and is sometimes central to the plot . 	0
WTP	11534	The show has a large supporting cast of characters some of whom become more or less prominent depending on the episode - and we can through in the eight parents , and Ike , while we are at it . 	0
WTP	11535	South prk revolves around the relationshps among Stan , Kyle , Cartman and Kenny , sometimes through their separate adventures . 	0
WTP	11536	The effec is identical - so who do you think you are fooling ( except possibly yourself ) when you protest that " main " does not appear ? 	0
WTP	11537	When you removed " main " from Butters , you removed it for the other four . 	0
WTP	11538	When these characters were identified as main , you added " main " to Butters . 	0
WTP	11539	The issue is not whether or not Butters is identifid as a " main " character , the question is whether Butters is given the sam prominence as Stan , Kyle , Cartman , and Kenny . 	0
WTP	11540	MarnetteD , removing the word " main " does not resolve the question . 	1
WTP	11541	This is unacceptable . 	0

WTP	11547	It just seems to stupid to censor content that speaks no message other then " This is an abortion . " . 	1
WTP	11548	I found " Zionist Regime " and other descriptions instead . 	0
WTP	11549	I might as well address this point now : as I had said above the pictures of abortion are pretty NPOV to begin with . 	0
WTP	11550	Pictures displayed matter-of-factly that somehow evoke pity or sympathy do not mean that they can ' t ever be displayed without sharing a point ; they just draw upon innate emotions . 	0
WTP	11551	As was said above I realize this is already a touched upon issue and my comment is nothing new to the argument but I was wondering why is there no actual picture of an abortion / post aborted fetus on this page ? 	0
WTP	11552	The picture is only as POV as the messages following it as I ' ve seen many proponents of abortion openly share them and declare they are worthless appeal to emotion in the context of abortion debate . 	1
WTP	11553	Regardless , they ' re neutral outside debate and it ' s curious an entire article on ABORTION has no picture of such despite the fact they clearly exist . 	0

WTP	11557	With all respect to James Randi , it seems that he is a stage magician , not a scientist it also looks like he has made a living for himself as a ' professional skeptic ' . 	0
WTP	11558	Is Randi considered an RS on what * is * pseudoscience or an RS as to his * opinion * on what is pseudoscientific . 	0
WTP	11559	As it happens there are items on this list that use Randi as a source , I have not really heard about the guy before today but his website doesn ' t exactly exude credibility . 	0
WTP	11560	It is still a discussion that is worth having sooner rather than later . . 	0
WTP	11561	As an aside , I seriously hope that we do not include scientology as sources regarding psychiatry , there is simply no need and it detracts from the case made by ' actual scientists and medical professionals ' . 	0
WTP	11562	Aliens in DC-10s notwithstanding , scientology have made themselves notable when they have the likes of Tom Cruise decrying psychiatry on prime-time tv . 	0
WTP	11563	This would defuse the oncoming impasse and allow readers to judge for themselves if they consider the sources authoritative . 	0
WTP	11564	I think we should consider properly attributing claims to their sources in-text . 	1
WTP	11565	As I mentioned above , there is no visible context in the picture showing that it has anything to do with either the West Bank or the Gaza Strip . 	0
WTP	11566	Thank you for returning to the talk page before editing . 	0
WTP	11567	It could have been taken in Nablus , East Jerusalem or Petach Tikvah . 	0
WTP	11568	It is a picture of four men , two in uniform , holding rifles . 	0
WTP	11569	As such it is an excellent illustrative photo of militantism in Israeli culture or the citizen-soldier nature of the IDF but not relevant to a general article about the IDF or an article about a specific location . 	1
WTP	11570	We should consider moving the first paragraph of this section elsewhere , as well as renaming it , since the other sources are quite low-quality and the entire bit is rather crystal ball-ish . 	0
WTP	11571	the quote is simply wrong . 	0
WTP	11572	I ' d like to question the latter edit of changing " cessation " into " permanent end " . 	0
WTP	11573	I can agree on " cessation " but are we sure that death is actually permanent ? 	0
WTP	11574	Is death defined as a permanent end of biological life ? 	0

WTP	11578	The Prophet , Allah bless him and grant him salvation , has said : The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews ( killing the Jews ) , when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees . 	0
WTP	11579	The stones and trees will say O Moslems , O Abdulla , there is a Jew behind me , come and kill him . 	0
WTP	11580	Only the Gharkad tree , ( evidently a certain kind of tree ) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews . 	0
WTP	11581	That said , I still fail to see what you ' re positing as the source of diversity . 	0
WTP	11582	Let ' s assume we mean ' speciation ' when we talk about ' diversity ' . 	0
WTP	11583	Anyway , that ' s obviously a semantic argument that ' s not worth having . 	0
WTP	11584	Drift and selection in that context act AGAINST the existing diversity , produced by mutations , and can only result in eventual fixation - that is , the elimination of variation . 	0
WTP	11585	If you just mean ' variation ' , e . g . the diversity evident within the human population , then you are wrong . 	1
WTP	11586	Also , I ' m unclear on how you ' re using ' diversity ' - if you mean strictly speciation , then I ' ll agree that drift and selection are important forces that are required to produce speciation , since one couldn ' t have fixation / divergence without them by definition . 	1
WTP	11587	I ' m unclear on what you mean . 	0
WTP	11588	I suppose I am confused , then - could you specify what these different lines of evidence are , one supporting common descent and the other supporting biodiversity ? 	0
WTP	11589	I agree that we don ' t need more discussion about editors themselves . 	0
WTP	11590	Let ' s all stick to the topic at hand . 	0
WTP	11591	Could you clarify ? 	0
WTP	11592	Yes ? 	0
WTP	11593	If you can ' t handle that , then you are under no obligation to contribute to this discussion . 	0

WTP	11607	I get that you " don ' t get it " but this is one event , THE FIRST VISION , was the event that true or false , was the basis for everything else that Smith did . 	0
WTP	11608	The redirect should be deleted and the word regime used in the lead with the correct wikilink . 	1
WTP	11609	I then entered " zionist regime " and it redirected to " zionist entity " ! 	0
WTP	11610	Not knowing exactly what a " zionist entity " was I went to the page . 	0
WTP	11611	The redirect is likely POV pushing and quite possibly it led to the use of entity in the lead being overlooked . 	0

WTP	11615	A ( very ) brief note ( maybe a single sentence ) might be appropriate , but a whole paragraph seems to be overkill on what is , essentially , a forgery ( from what I can tell ) and not , in the end , relevant to the issue of describing the Basque language . 	1

WTP	11633	Here is my suggested solution which 1 ) I believe to truly preserve the interests of all , studious etymologists and inquisitive third-graders alike ; and 2 ) requires your help . 	0

WTP	11818	If we included even a small paragraph for every controversy of a similar scope to the recent soldiers ' testimonies , we ' d easily get a 100K section only for criticism , because there were a series of such testimonies after each major operation , and some of the notable cases are listed here . 	1

WTP	11823	Mostly my sense of bemused irritation comes from folks who want to portray all natural , surgical , and pharmaceutical procedures similarly . 	0
WTP	11824	I can agree with that ( while also noting that the most widely used form of induced fertilized egg / blastocyst / fetus rejections are pharmaceutical , not surgical , in nature ) , but could that mean that the article is lopsided , or how we use pictures in the article is lopsided , or what ? 	0
WTP	11825	Ronabop , I think it ' s clear that most of the article is about induced abortion , as is most of the debate over the issue . 	0
WTP	11826	While seeing such things doesn ' t really bother me all that much ( having fed a good 20-30 fetuses to coyotes in my life , and consuming at least a few hundred . . . life on a farm an all ) , I ' m divided on how to present the subject , images , and article , properly in a NPOV manner . 	0
WTP	11827	However , I can understand their motivations , in that they are wishing to " humanize " and " personalize " , abortion , and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images . 	0
WTP	11828	To repeat a refrain , many who have asked for ( and suggested ) pictures are * not * asking for pictures of an abortion procedure , or process , they are asking for gore pictures of a dead human fetus , which is not what this article is about , subject-wise ( Though it could be , if the article was renamed Human aborted fetuses ) . 	0

WTP	11851	Putting this in the lead will just cause more vandalism to the article than there is now ( which is already substantial ) . 	0

WTP	11991	The argument consistently is " well , this guy has all this criticism , so why doesn ' t this guy get equal amount ? " 	0
WTP	11992	The problem is , that ' s not how balance works . 	1
WTP	11993	You don ' t balance out articles by putting the same amount of criticism in one because this much is in the other , anymore than you determine how many characters , pictures or quotes appear in each article . 	0

WTP	12010	" Number one , whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the Constitution , what we ' re really saying is , in fact , that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a - a child , a nine-month-old - - child that was delivered to term . 	0
WTP	12011	Unfortunately , this bill goes a little bit further , and so I just want to suggest , not that I think it ' ll make too much difference with respect to how we vote , that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny . " 	0
WTP	12012	And there was some suggestion that we might be able to craft something that might meet constitutional muster with respect to caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion . 	0
WTP	12013	" Well , it turned out - that during the testimony a number of members who are typically in favor of a woman ' s right to choose an abortion were actually sympathetic to some of the concerns that your - you raised and that were raised by witnesses in the testimony . 	0
WTP	12014	Is that correct ? " 	0
WTP	12015	And one of the concerns that came out in the testimony was the fact that they were not being properly cared for during that brief period of time that they were still living . 	0
WTP	12016	According to the IL Senate transcripts , which links I just included , Obama ' s reasons for opposing the bills can be seen as follows , from his words posted verbatim : " Senator O ' Malley , the testimony during the committee indicated that one of the key concerns was - is that there was a method of abortion , an induced abortion , where the - - the fetus or child , as - as some might describe it , is still temporarily alive outside the womb . 	0
WTP	12017	As for # 1 , if you mean Obama was opposing the bills on state ' s rights , then you ' re wrong , and I ' m not sure where you are getting your sources . 	1
WTP	12018	I mean , it - it would essentially bar abortions , because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child , then this would be an antiabortion statute . 	0
WTP	12019	That determination then , essentially , if it was accepted by a court , would forbid abortions to take place . 	0

WTP	12028	RG , you state certainties , except when you say that Zeppelin are without a doubt a metal band . 	1
WTP	12029	They have one foot in the hard rock genre , and the other in the blues genre , together with the influences you mention , and I would hesitantly include heavy metal among those influences , because none of their albums are actual heavy metal ; they don ' t have it as an overhanging concept , but they do have heavy metal-ish ( I ' d say hard rock ) songs in their albums , like " Whole Lotta Love " and " Immigrant Song " . 	0
WTP	12030	And no , that ' s not slander . 	1

WTP	12196	Regime does not carry the same pejorative meaning and means a government not a state ( it is clear from any translation that Ahmadinejad meant government ) so clearly they can not be interchangeable . 	1
WTP	12197	Firstly , the wiki page says using entity is " a pejorative for the State of Israel " . 	0
WTP	12198	A search finds 63 , 000 results for entity being used in a translation of the speech ( mostly op-eds and blogs with a few conservative newspapers ) and 357 , 000 results for " Zionist Regime " being used in a translation of the speech ( a large number of mainstream media including Haaretz , CNN , Washington Post , NYT and BBC etc ) . 	0

WTP	12221	Of course they take their view of Catholicism from a sensationalistic press rather than going to the source which says a homosexual must be treated with respect , compassion and sensitivity , also unjust disrcimination against them is wrong . 	0

WTP	12226	I have found in the past that no matter how notable a criticism of Obama , or how well-sourced it may be , that the editors on the Obama page will fight it tooth and nail , bringing in other liberal editors from elsewhere on Wikipedia and then claiming ' consensus ' regardless of past editors who provided opposite consensus who just aren ' t present at the time . 	1

WTP	12232	As to confusing , while BP is , as you say , the operator of the well , Transocean is the operator of the rig and Transocean is the driller of the well ; it technically isn ' t an operating well until the drilling rig sails off and a production rig comes in . 	0

WTP	12234	The Macondo Prospect isn ' t a well , it ' s an oil field . 	0
WTP	12235	What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean ( allegedly faultily , with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks , indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout ) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton ( allegedly shoddily ; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years ; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year ) . 	0
WTP	12236	The Deepwater Horizon is a drilling rig , known at Wikipedia as an oil platform . 	0

WTP	12240	And , while BP was 65% owner of the field , and so of the oil gushing from that field , the hearings that have been held have raked Transocean and Halliburton over the coals , and the investigations are looking into their actions , inactions and histories as much as BP ' s . 	0

WTP	12254	if your answer is yes , I await your edit to the page ( as I see you have done much editing to it , and will leave it to you ) and will not argue about having this information described in the first paragraph of the " Hamas " page . 	0
WTP	12255	For example , would you agree that in the first paragraph of the " israel " wiki page , it would state that the majority of the Palestinian population and millions of other people around the world regard israel as one of the biggest terrorist states ? ? 	0
WTP	12256	No one here is opposing the idea of including the ( false ) labels that people want to attribute to Hamas , we are just asking for the same treatment as is given to other governing bodies on wikipedia . 	1
WTP	12257	Before they were elected , maybe it would have seemed logical to include this type of view in the first paragraph , but not now , since the main subject surrounding the group ( for the people it represents i . e . the Palestinians ) pertains to it ' s legal standing as a minority government . 	0
WTP	12258	Thank you for moving my comment . . . . . as for the discussion , if you agree that the wiki page for " United States " should state in the first paragraph that it is considered by millions of people around the world as the biggest terrorist state , then I see no problem in doing this with Hamas ' wiki page . 	0

WTP	12804	We could add lots of little unimportant technical details such as that there was actually Southern Ireland etc . , but for a brief introductory paragraph covering the history of Ireland over hundreds of years I don ' t think that your modification is logical . 	0

WTP	12808	I was simply surprised that it ' s integrated into a section about her music and that there is not a Personal life section in this article where it can go . 	0

WTP	12810	There is no justification to support a controversy section , unless I ' m missing something , right ? 	0
WTP	12811	America and Britain have engaged in extensive occupations in many countries and neither of their articles contain any sort of " controversy " section describing them . 	0
WTP	12812	The controversy section has little to do with the " occupation . " 	0
WTP	12813	And to be fair that balance must be based on the weight of good incidents compared to the weight of bad . 	1
WTP	12814	Some people have shown impatience with the listing of Catholic positives in the article . 	0
WTP	12815	Then a historian who wondered how these Spanish torture devices had reached Sussex discovered not only that the Spanish Inquisition never used these type of devices , but that they were all local and British-made . 	0
WTP	12816	The point is that a balance has to be achieved between positive and negative . 	0
WTP	12817	These were immediately labelled and put into the local museum as " Torture devices of the Spanish Inquisition . " 	0
WTP	12818	For decades people looked at them and tutted in horror at the evils of the Catholic Church . 	0
WTP	12819	Many people ' s views of the Catholic Church have been formed by the " cold-war " propaganda of past eras , which sought to demonize Catholicism through spin and exaggeration . 	1
WTP	12820	A typical example of how this leads people to assume the worst was when some instruments of torture were found in a castle in Sussex 100 years ago . 	0
WTP	12821	Further to Karanacs objections : The article is necessarily broad-brush . 	1
WTP	12822	It cannot deal with every incident and nuance over the past 2000 years , especially if populist pressure tends toward putting in only hegative issues and leaving out the positive . 	0

WTP	12835	However , terms like denialism , misrepresentation and distortion are how main view scientists have received theories differing from HIV causing AIDS . 	0
WTP	12836	The issue at hand , if one is going to give any lip service to dissent , is the fact that some * scientists * dissent . 	0
WTP	12837	Anything that is relevant can be added to the appropriate sections in chronological order of which they occur . 	0
WTP	12838	So , when describing a controversy that has been given the label " denialism " ( a contortion of the English language ) , why is it a " misrepresentation " or " distortion " of a * scientific * WP article to focus on * scientists * in that section ? 	0
WTP	12839	Everyone knows that all sorts of non-scientists have differing views about HIV , including millions of people who totally accept the " single direct cause " paradigm that is mainstream . 	0

WTP	12851	A brief scan through parts of the article reveals some dubious points : In 1521 , the first Catholics were baptized in what would become the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia , the Philippines . [ 171 ] The following year , Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico , although they did not begin large-scale baptisms until 1537 , when Pope Paul III determined that the indigenous peoples did have souls . [ 174 ] Over the next 150 years , the missions expanded into southwestern North America . [ 175 ] The native people were legally defined as children , and the priests took on a paternalistic role , often enforced with corporal punishment . [ 176 ] In India , Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among a Christian community which had been established by Thomas the Apostle . [ 177 ] I find a lot of this information very dubious . 	1
WTP	12852	Huge numbers were converted in Mexico before 1537 , and I don ' t think there was much serious debate over whether Indians had souls . 	0
WTP	12853	WHO legally defined native people as children , Church , Governments ? 	0
WTP	12854	Where and when ? 	0
WTP	12855	" Corporal punishment " applied to everyone who wasn ' t a noble up until fairly recent times . 	0

WTP	12884	Both offices also were very clear that " First Lady " is a term bestowed upon the wife of a sitting President , any other female acting as hostess of behalf of the President ( in those cases where there is no wife or the wife of a President is unable to serve in her official capacity ) , the designated woman is called the " White House Hostess " , not First Lady . 	0

WTP	12890	Thank you for your edits to this page . 	0
WTP	12891	There has been long-term confusion over who has " authority " to bestow the title " first lady " . 	0
WTP	12892	Since it is an unofficial title , the opinions of any office of the government remain just that - opinions . 	0

WTP	12912	It ' s not quite correct to treat the Earth as a blackbody , since the atmosphere has a confounding effect - we might say that the Earth acts as a blackbody above the level of the atmosphere , but actually the amount of radiation emitted is inconsistent with the surface temperature of earth . 	1

WTP	12982	Remember , this is not a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of characterizations . 	0
WTP	12983	This perpetrates the inherent bias of this article ' s inclusion criteria which allows for characterizations made by certain notable organizations and people , but disallows characterizations made by other organizations and people just as notable . 	0
WTP	12984	Because some editors feel that these organizations and researchers are in themselves pseuodskeptical and / or pseudoscientific , thus they are ill-equipped to label something a pseudoscience and therefore their views on what they characterize to be a pseudoscience should not be included in this list . 	0
WTP	12985	Why ? 	0
WTP	12986	Recent attempts to include significant views of certain notable organizations , notable academics and notable researchers have been summarily eliminated and denied from this article . 	0
WTP	12987	So , why are we including the characterizations made by these researchers and organizations , but excluding - and moreover disallowing - the characterizations made by other researchers and organizations . 	0
WTP	12988	While per WP : PSCI only a general consensus in the scientific community can truly label a topic as pseudoscience , this article includes entries of topics which have only been characterized as a pseudoscience by one researcher or by one skeptical organization and not the general scientific community . 	0

WTP	13267	Not as outrageous to me as saying Sabbath aren ' t , but that ' s primarily because -as historically and musically questionable as it is - the ' Zeppelin aren ' t / weren ' t metal ' thing is common enough to be taken seriously in the common mind . 	0

WTP	13307	We all know what protesters look like : they span pretty much all ages , they sometimes go to events and important places , and they hold picket signs . 	0

WTP	13315	However , when a reference is included , is isn ' t a copyright violation , it called a REFERENCE . 	0

WTP	13325	This is the sort of discussion that is important to have with members of the wiki editorial group . 	0
WTP	13326	They are criticism , not research . 	0
WTP	13327	Reviews aren ' t the same as histories or biographies ; they are critical commentary / opinion , and do not have authoritative weight on the histories and biogrpahies cover , because that ' s not what they are intended to cover . 	1
WTP	13328	So far I only see one source that would classify as such , that being this . 	0
WTP	13329	What Ibaranoff needs to provide is a reliable source ( or several ) that explain why System of a Down shouldn ' t be classified as nu metal ; providing sources that simply don ' t say the words " nu metal " isn ' t the same thing . 	1
WTP	13330	The MTV article cited describes SOAD as a nu metal band and provides a context for them within the genre . 	0
WTP	13331	Now , as for sources . 	0
WTP	13332	Aside from that , many of the sources Ibaranoff points to at Talk : System of a Down are album / live reviews . 	0
WTP	13333	Furthermore , one of the primary metal histories used a source for the article , Ian Christe ' s Sound of the Beast , describes them as nu metal as well , in a chapter largely devoted to nu metal ( I just double checked the book this instant ) . 	0
WTP	13334	Unless there is a reliable source confirming verifiable proof of what seems now to only be accusations , I don ' t see eeason to change this article . - - 	0
WTP	13335	We don ' t determine article content by tallying how many times a phrase is or isn ' t mentioned in a handful of online articles ( and that is a handful ; that ' s nowhere near the amount of press coverage the band has had in its career ) . 	0

WTP	13342	We have already established that you clearly have no problem with having etymological information in the article , because if you had your edit would have consisted of removing the section " naming " altogether . 	0
WTP	13343	Thank you for the name calling , I think we can already see where you ' re coming from in this discussion . 	0
WTP	13344	As you are no doubt well aware , Wikipedia is not censored . 	0
WTP	13345	The version you substituted left the word completely unmentioned , which does * not * aid understanding and accessibility . 	1
WTP	13346	In fact it reduces it , because the reader can only be left in confusion wondering what the vulgar word might have been . 	1
WTP	13347	So clearly you believe we need information on the origin of the word here . 	0
WTP	13348	If so , we have to look at how we can make this section as clear and informative as possible . 	0
WTP	13349	Avoid words such as slander , traditional , liberal orthodox conservative . 	0
WTP	13350	I support the more correct wording even if it appears to others to be pro-Catholic ( which I dont think it does - facts are facts and we just want to tell the truth ) If we eliminate current wording in favor of Karanacs proposal , we lose several important wikilinks too . 	0
WTP	13351	We can ' t just eliminate important facts just to appear to be not - pro Catholic . 	0

WTP	13353	I ' m sorry Karanacs , I disagree with your proposal . 	0
WTP	13354	Wassupwestcoast ' s argument is difficult for me to comprehend when we have spent ourselves with many scholarly works that support the current content and Wassup has not offered any scholarly works to refute the present content . 	0

WTP	13360	Secondly , you will note that the Dede Maroz , Christkind or other names for Santa / Father Christmas aren ' t as widely read as this , one of the three main articles on the subject ( the other two being Father Christmas and Saint Nicholas ) , and certainly they aren ' t anywhere near the quality of this one ; they aren ' t a valid comparison . 	1
WTP	13361	Thirdly , the Buddha / Siddhartha argument is closer to the point , but still falls short via definition . 	0
WTP	13362	Siddhartha was a real chap , and pretty nifty on his pins , by all accounts . 	0
WTP	13363	Buddha isn ' t like a spiritual Santa Claus , though . 	1
WTP	13364	Buddha is state of being ; Santa is not a state of being . 	0

WTP	13408	My position is that you started the edit war by removing a very central piece of information that had been in the article since 2006 as " utter irrelevance " , and persisting in reverting attempts to put it back by me and another person that just saw your removal as absurd ( I think claiming it ' s irrelevant is revisionism if anything ) . 	0

WTP	13411	I think that the page should have been renamed Catholic Church and the first sentence gone the other way around saying " The Catholic Church , also known as the Roman Catholic Church … " . 	1
WTP	13412	I think this is evident from the title of the book " The Catechism of the Catholic Church " which is conspicuously not entitled " The Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church " . 	0

WTP	13417	A peer reviewer has made two suggestions for improvement to the article that would be significant changes . 	0
WTP	13418	Roman Catholic Church is part of Christianity and it would be inconsistent to make the comparison here , it would also be off topic for the subject matter of the page . 	0
WTP	13419	What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims . 	1
WTP	13420	It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics . 	0
WTP	13421	This is more than mere History , it has to do with the present day and the two issues of Origin and Mission go together , they are entertwined with each other and extend beyond the concept of History with regards to the church ' s activities in the world today . 	0
WTP	13422	Also , eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes . 	1
WTP	13423	It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page . 	0
WTP	13424	Currently , I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA , that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote . 	0

WTP	13448	I think the " obnoxious and fervent " complaint has more to do with scale : the pro-choice photograph was taken at the March for Women ' s Lives while the pro-life one appears to be a smaller scale demonstration staged solely by Bound for Life . 	1
WTP	13449	I myself am against the addition of hip hop . 	1
WTP	13450	The genre is not prevalent enough in Rihanna ' s music I would say , and the influences of it that are present in her music are covered by contemporary R&B which is already listed . 	0

WTP	13479	Talk about the personal attacks getting way off , here is a reference for you : " The teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith . " 	0
WTP	13480	Guess who wrote most of the content . 	0
WTP	13481	I will keep that in mind when commenting in the future . 	0
WTP	13482	Point taken , I apologize . 	0
WTP	13483	Once again you are wrong , take a look at wikipedia commons there are graphic images of sexual acts available ( I can post some examples here if you still don ' t believe me ) , I suggest reading I don ' t like it is a bad reason to remove content 	0
WTP	13484	Hamas did bomb civilian targets , which is a terrorist tactic . 	0
WTP	13485	But the thing is , if we put this in the lead , it will not stop . 	0
WTP	13486	How can you claim that the UN report is a joke when we all saw with our own eyes the IDF bombing UNRWA schools with white phosphorus ? 	0
WTP	13487	And even if militants used the schools as Israel claims ( which is a doubt ) that is still not an excuse to bomb the schools . 	0
WTP	13488	Lastly , I do not object to the wording you have suggested in your last comment . 	0
WTP	13489	Have a nice day . 	0
WTP	13490	We will put this line in Hezbollah , PLO , and any other power that opposes Israel . 	0
WTP	13491	That ' s why I objected to the sentence not because I like bombing civilians . 	0
WTP	13492	Agreed . 	0

WTP	13497	It totally depends on what the reference actually says . 	0

WTP	13500	As it currently stands , the island has no single agreed upon flag by ROI or NI . 	0

WTP	13503	This is now no longer the norm , women now lead their own lives and have jobs of their own . 	0
WTP	13504	The whole idea of a " First Lady " is a sexist one that assumes that a wife ' s only duty is to serve her husband , and be a hostess . 	0
WTP	13505	The terms may sound silly , pompous , and old fashioned , but if that is an argument againt them , it is also an argument against both the names , but even more so the position and functions , of the " First Lady " and " First Gentleman " . 	0
WTP	13506	The titles mentioned of " First Master " and " First Lord " are in fact technically more accurate terms than " First Gentleman " , it ' s just that journalist and commentators seem to think that Gentleman is the equivalent of Lady in this context which , if you are pedantic , it isn ' t . 	0
WTP	13507	Yet present wording does mention the major events and provides wikilinks that Karanacs version would eliminate . 	0
WTP	13508	Responding to Karanacs : The present article wording does not mention justification of either Mary or Elizabeth ' s actions - it treats them equally - NPOV . 	0
WTP	13509	No offense , it is just my honest opinion . 	0
WTP	13510	I think present wording is more valuable and factually accurate that what Karanacs has proposed . 	1
WTP	13511	I am more interested in providing those facts and I dont think they make the article POV one way or the other . 	0
WTP	13512	If I was a kid doing research , I am more helped by present wording with appropriate wikilinks . 	0
WTP	13513	Interesting interpretations of the Anglo-Irish treaty aside , the Free State never had control over Northern Ireland . 	0
WTP	13514	Southern Irish troops ( we didn ' t have tanks ) didn ' t march in one day and out the next . 	0
WTP	13515	At the time there was no disagreement that Great Britain ( with or without Northern Ireland ) was to be the successor state of the UK of Great Britain and Ireland . 	0
WTP	13516	Thus it is was the Free State that joined the League of Nations as an entirely new entity while the UK remained a member . 	0
WTP	13517	As a matter of English there ' s no ambiguity in saying that Northern Ireland remained in the UK . 	0
WTP	13518	Legally speaking it ' s the rules of state succession that determine whether the 1923 UK was the same state as the 1920 UK . 	0
WTP	13519	There was a time when states didn ' t have official names but managed to exist nonetheless . 	0
WTP	13520	The Statement : " Belfast is a city in the United Kingdom " was as true in 1920 as it was in 1923 and as it is now . 	0
WTP	13521	Northern Ireland never re-joined the UK , because for all practical purposes , they never left . 	1

WTP	13524	Okay . 	0
WTP	13525	I see you ' ve left a message on his talk page . 	0
WTP	13526	Right now the article still states " However the whole finding has come under serious question , even to the point of tarnishing Rius ' s scholarly pedigree . " and gives [ 2 ] as reference . 	0
WTP	13527	It could be quoted in full in the note , if you like . 	0

WTP	13529	There is about four times as much Duffy in this section as there is Norman . 	0
WTP	13530	You are confounding common descent ( using evidence to argue that all life came from one ancestor , ie : going backwards ) with mechanisms for biodiversity ( natural selection , genetic drift or going forwards once that common acestor has been established ) . 	0

WTP	13532	There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding regarding the role of the UGLE and the Grand Lodge of BC and Yukon , which I attempted to clear up with my various edits . 	0
WTP	13533	The United Grand Lodge of England is not the " official body of Freemasonry " , as none exists , but it is considered the standard for Masonic recognition ( there are exceptions , but Crowley wouldn ' t fit into one of them . ) 	0
WTP	13534	The Grand Loge de France violates Anderson ' s Constitutions by not requiring a belief in a Supreme Being ; as such , its regularity is not in question at all , but nonexistent . 	0
WTP	13535	In addition , recognition is not disputed by the Canadian body ( as mentioned before , no such dispute is necessary ) ; that organization simply functions as a repository of responses , original and reposted , to common anti-Masonic allegations . 	1
WTP	13536	Judas Priests contributions are not sourced either , so why should they have the right to be up there unsourced ? 	0
WTP	13537	This is actually the first time I have looked at the Obama page , and it ' s predictably predictable . 	0
WTP	13538	I find it all over Wikipedia , but especially in the political arena , whether it ' s a politician or a political commentator or whatnot . 	0
WTP	13539	I notice on the Bush page regarding most of his major policies and decisions , there ' s always something negative about them tacked on someplace , how he was accused of this nefarious move or that nefarious deal . 	0
WTP	13540	You would think this guy walks on water , has never made a wrong move or a bad decision , and 100% of the nation loves him . 	0
WTP	13541	You ' d never know it here . 	0
WTP	13542	No such thing with Obama or his moves , and there have been MANY complaints and many concerns about every aspect of his presidency . 	0

WTP	13548	If it weren ' t for his most recent edit here , I would have held back from responding here for a day or two to see if Jzyehoshua was going to take my advice and fish out one issue from the several above to focus on calmly and patiently discussing a responsible edit for , but his going back over earlier edits to change them to red boldface text as is his first edit after my admonition suggests it ' s still more for him about attracting attention on and strewing and smearing this stuff throughout the talk and archive pages than it is about responsible and rationally presented editorial suggestions for the article . 	0
WTP	13549	The argument that it ' s elsewhere at Wikipedia so it belongs here , too , seems particularly obtuse . 	0

WTP	13554	The whole point of the FAQs is to preclude this sort of post from turning into a rehashing of the same tired arguments for the 70th time . 	0
WTP	13555	This is consistent with similar articles and I think justified by wiki protocol . 	0
WTP	13556	In truth , the LAShTAL . com resources are significantly more extensive and comprehensive than the existing Wikipedia article . 	0
WTP	13557	I would posit that much of the information contained in the Wikipedia article is sourced from the research and effort of the LAShTAL . com membership . 	0
WTP	13558	For completeness , the Wikipedia article should point the user to LAShTAL . com . 	0
WTP	13559	The LAShTAL . com site is the home of the Aleister Crowley Society . 	0
WTP	13560	Based on a review of the LAShTAL . com site and WP : ELNO , I agree with Acsociety ' s assessment that the Aleister Crowley article ahould reference the LAShTAL . com site . 	1
WTP	13561	The LAShTAL . com resources are much more than collection links to existing work - they comprise the most accurate , scholarly analysis of the man and his works in any format . 	0
WTP	13562	As such , it is the recognized comprehensive authority on the life and works of Crowley and the repository of much original work on the topic . 	0

WTP	13565	As for the military suicide picture , we already have two black and white WWII images of dead people , so I think something a bit different would be preferable . 	1
WTP	13566	A picture of an electric chair would be more appropriate , or if we must continue to shock the reader , a person that has been hung with flies hovering over their corpse . 	0
WTP	13567	And as we ' ve said , this isn ' t capital punishment but a wartime mass execution of the perceived enemy . 	0
WTP	13568	There are already 2 others , and there was a third in the martyrdom section , which was again irrelevant . 	0
WTP	13569	The argument , as we ' ve made , is that there are already more than enough war pictures - there is more to death than images of people being shot dead in a war . 	1
WTP	13570	logic dictates you are either accepting " sky is not blue " or " there is a problem with your claim that prohibits me from understading it " . 	0
WTP	13571	holocaust denial is NOT providing an alternative claim but simply stating that certain claims are false ( not acceppting them ) . 	0
WTP	13572	so yes . 	0
WTP	13573	if I would say " Sky is blue " and you say " I dont accept your claim " . 	0
WTP	13574	how do I figure that out ? 	0
WTP	13575	Cheers ! 	0
WTP	13576	the english word claim easily fits the quote " we don ' t accept this claim " . 	0

WTP	13586	What ' s so unappealing about saying your band was the first metal group ? 	0
WTP	13587	Halford says Judas Priest was the first metal group ? 	0

WTP	13601	I hold the position that personal lives are trivial within the scope of an individuals career , purely for the reason their personal life is obviously not their life ' s work . 	1
WTP	13602	The focus of an encyclopedia should be their contribution to their respective field , not tabloid journalism and the recent ( 10-20 year ) emphasis on detailing every forgettable factor of the lives of celebrities . 	1

WTP	13606	I don ' t know what you mean by " shock images " . 	0
WTP	13607	And from a pro-life perspective , such images would illustrate what they are fighting against ! 	0
WTP	13608	After all , they don ' t believe that foetuses are people , and they think that abortion is acceptable ! 	0
WTP	13609	The book said that large numbers of people were on the missions , but weren ' t officially baptized until after the pope ' s ruling . 	0
WTP	13610	So how could anybody , in all intellectual honesty , object ? ? 	0
WTP	13611	If other books dispute this , it can be removed , but I think it ' s accurate . 	1
WTP	13612	Your argument is not with me but with a Wikipedia content guideline and a number of editors who feel the same way . 	0
WTP	13613	I will not get drawn into your ad hominems , which distracts from the discussion . 	0
WTP	13614	I am not seeking confrontation with you ; I ' d much rather we reach an agreement , ideally after you have addressed my concerns . 	1

WTP	13618	What about Australian , Japanese , Russian , Chinese , Spanish etc . associations then ? 	0
WTP	13619	My concern is that , as soon as one breeder association gets linked , everybody feels another one would be just as important , and the section mutates into a business directory . 	0
WTP	13620	Certainly the oil spill is relevant to Obama ' s biography , but all the secondary details about other entities are most certainly not . 	0
WTP	13621	When editors / accounts new to this article post broadside attacks here on the integrity of Wikipedia they can stir up dissent but they don ' t get a whole lot of traction . 	0
WTP	13622	This should only be a summary of the specific aspects of the oil spill that relate to Obama . 	0

WTP	13680	Now , since neither U . S . / israel claim that thier intention is to target civilian populations , we cannot choose to believe one , while dismissing the other . 	1

WTP	13684	If I were to move the " . . . considered in part , or wholly . . . . . . . a terrorist organisation . . . .

WTP	13699	The image should focus on death in general , not a custom . 	0
WTP	13700	I recomend an image that actually shows the corpse of a human or animal . 	0
WTP	13701	However , this image does the opposite . 	0
WTP	13702	It seems to focus not on death itself , but our traditions that revolve around its occurence . 	0
WTP	13703	I am rather upset with the current image Image : Civil War graves . JPG This article should be mainly about the science of death , and its ties with human culture secondary . 	1

WTP	13712	Maybe some other nice editor , maybe a seminarian can help us out here if they see our perusings on the page - it would be appreciated ! 	0
WTP	13713	It may take me a few days . 	0
WTP	13714	I havnt gone to the seminary yet but there must be some reliable sources that will help us put the proper information into this article . 	0
WTP	13715	The problem is that we cant put anything in the article and list it as a fact unless we have a reliable source . 	0
WTP	13716	Furthermore , citing " quackometer . net " is not exactly a noteworthy reference in and of itself . 	1
WTP	13717	That is the opinion of someone who has no standing at all . 	0

WTP	13723	I hope that outside editors may be able to suggest some form of words which succinctly conveys enough of both perspectives on what happened for the reader to see that the underlying picture may be more complex than can be conveyed in a summary , and that they should read on for the full picture . 	0
WTP	13724	I will not be around much in the next week , but have launched this RFC in the hope that other editors can help build an agreement . 	0
WTP	13725	I will in due course burrow in my box of history books , but I am not persuaded that a precise reference is really needed for an adjective such as this . 	0
WTP	13726	My suggested compromise may be a poor one , and I can see that for example " legally " might be an alternative adjective , or maybe some wholly different construct might be better . 	0

WTP	13740	I disagree . 	1
WTP	13741	Per WP : LEAD , we have sources in the body of the article , if there is a content dispute , we can refer them there or to this section , or both . 	0
WTP	13742	I think the tag should stay until this is settled . 	0
WTP	13743	However , I do care -to some degree - about presenting an actual argument . 	0
WTP	13744	I would also add , if it hasn ' t been said , that WP : TERRORIST isn ' t a policy , it ' s a style guideline , and one that allows exceptions . 	0

WTP	13767	I pointed out that millions of people around the world literally believe in Santa Claus , etc . etc . Mythical isn ' t great , but at least we can look at it ( and parents can tell their children , if need be ) that " mythical " doesn ' t mean " fake " , it means that there are myths about him , which is true . 	0
WTP	13768	In my opinion , List of countries by formation dates is a lot of hogwash . 	0

WTP	13770	Maybe the article , ( List of countries by formation dates ) , should be a bit clearer on the mater . 	0

WTP	13781	Although , quite frankly , even the Conservapedia article shows a more nuanced understanding of what Whitten said than you ' re displaying here : " It is not a technical issue that Whitten addressed , but a social issue throughout research in general . " 	0
WTP	13782	For that , all you have to say is that the earth , or living material , is not a closed system and the second law says nothing about it . 	0
WTP	13783	In an open system structure may form without violating any physical law . 	0
WTP	13784	However , I ' m not sure as to how much all of this relevant to the main topic . 	1
WTP	13785	As I see it , the whole point of all of this is to debunk the creationist " 2nd law " claim . 	0

WTP	13800	A factual claim , right or wrong , is not criticism . 	0
WTP	13801	And what you ' re referring to is criticism in the sense of critique , something we don ' t really do for articles about people , but we do in say films , where many have a " critical reception " section . 	0
WTP	13802	That is the more serious proposal , covering people ' s negative opinions about Obama , and that is precisely what is discouraged on Wikipedia and has been rejected time after time . 	0
WTP	13803	That is normally based in fact , although there is a different sense ( one wholly unsuitable here ) for baseless negative assertions - but even those are assertions of opinion . 	0
WTP	13804	It would fit the Wikipedia concept of a coatrack . 	0
WTP	13805	Others refer to criticism as negative opinions about the facts of a thing , the oppositve of praise . 	0
WTP	13806	Responding to Jzyehoshua ' s point , you are referring to a different meaning of the word " criticism " . 	1
WTP	13807	What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts , which is not criticism at all . 	0
WTP	13808	And yes , I am disqualifying many of the accounts from which this was brought this up in the past - they are now banned as fake accounts , and the long-term editors here have been very wary of new accounts making similar proposals . 	0
WTP	13809	Anyway , it ' s very unlikely that the editors would agree now to adding a criticism section , and I ' m not sure how productive a protracted discussion would be here . 	0
WTP	13810	Yes , 	0
WTP	13811	Okay , but that ' s not really the focus of the section I removed , which insinuated that Linux was written to solve GNU ' s kernel problem . 	0
WTP	13812	I am not qualified to take a scalpel to most of those examples . 	0
WTP	13813	I do recommend that those who are far more technically knowledgeable than I am should take a careful look at where and how HIV and AIDS can be made distinct in the text in order to avoid unnecessary conflation . 	1
WTP	13814	Unfortunately , I have little to offer on this technical topic other than earlier comments on the lead and my current draft of a rewrite for the Denialism section ( still visible after three hours ) . 	0
WTP	13815	Well , that ' s a useful criticism , thank you , JoeSmack . 	0
WTP	13816	The new page could also address social ( young adults , thus orphans ) and political ( locations other than South Africa ) issues in more detail . 	0
WTP	13817	In such case , my opinion is that the Denialism section could be excised entirely and moved to the new page instead of being an awkward part of the HIV page . 	0
WTP	13818	Finally , if the issue really boils down to focusing more on the science ( which I generally support ) , perhaps yet another page could be created specifically about " HIV and AIDS Linkage " or some similar title . 	0
WTP	13819	Can you repost them ? 	0
WTP	13820	Aha - You ' ve let your raison d ' etre slip - a line intentionally inserted to place the blame firmly on unionists for causing the split . 	0
WTP	13821	The ' blame ' can be equally ( if not more so , but lets not go there ) shared with nationalists for starting a civil war and demanding independence in the first place ! ! ! 	0
WTP	13822	Lou Rell has no plans to be a public figure when his wife , Jodi Rell , becomes governor of Connecticut , so it is unclear what his title will be . 	0

WTP	13824	On the other hand , Gary Sebelius , husband of Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius , seems to prefer the term " First Dude . " 	0

WTP	13874	For example , this book : I throw up my hands here . 	0
WTP	13875	Regarding the comment that the scandal is a drop in bucket of 2 000 years of Catholic history , there are plenty of good reputable sources that put the scandal in context of the church ' s history without the the fault of ' recentism ' . 	0
WTP	13876	The contributing editors are turning a blind eye . 	0

WTP	13880	( edit conflict ) As noted in my edit summary , this article is about the life and career of Barack Obama . 	0
WTP	13881	It is not an in-depth article about all of the policy decisions and the politics that go along with them . 	0
WTP	13882	Even if the content were well-sourced , and of sufficient weight to include in the encyclopedia somewhere ( neither of which are the case ) , it is not pertinent to the subject of this article . 	0
WTP	13883	Although the Washington Times is sometimes a reliable source for some content , it is problematic when it comes to politics due to the paper ' s strong conservative bent , lackluster respect for factual accuracy ( often mischaracterizing or printing unsubstantiated facts to support its position ) , and being very sloppy about distinguishing opinion and propaganda from factual reportage . 	1
WTP	13884	This article is a case in point . 	0
WTP	13885	It is masquerading as a news story , but it uses phrases like " back door " and conjecture like " the memo suggests that . . . " , amidst a highly selective choice of quotes , to hide what is partly an opinion and speculation piece . 	0
WTP	13886	Regarding weight here or anywhere , the substance is that a second or third tier official approved a report written by four staffers ( or something like that ) proposing a form of immigration amnesty . 	0
WTP	13887	There is nothing in the source that says it has anything to do with Obama , or is anywhere close to getting enacted . 	0
WTP	13888	And no , we don ' t include every minor one - everything has to meet WP : VERIFY . 	1
WTP	13889	I said SadKermit qualifies as two major newspapers have done articles on it , not that it was notable due to having a domain . 	0

WTP	13891	Just because a YouTube video also has a domain name doesn ' t make it reliable . 	0
WTP	13892	SadKermit qualifies due to it ' s references , and the Family Guy parodies qualify due to the fact that it ' s a notable tv series . 	0

WTP	13897	Let ' s try to find them . 	0
WTP	13898	If all the energy was lost back into space , no work could be done on earth ( ie : no wind , no huricanes , no life , no waves , no warmth ( except by Earth ' s own radioactivity ) , etc etc ) . 	1
WTP	13899	An HIV / AIDS Linkage article would be redundant because it is described here clearly . 	1

WTP	13914	I agree it would be " obfuscating " to turn the heading of AIDS Denialism into something like " Alternative Theories " but I also think it is obfuscating to lump all skeptical scientists together when they clearly do not share the same beliefs about HIV ' s role . 	1
WTP	13915	Hence why I said we should wait for the court ruling agreeing with the administration ' s argument that the mandate is a tax . 	0
WTP	13916	It ' s more complex than that , because we don ' t know what counts as a tax on under-$250 , 000s . 	0
WTP	13917	As we said , it ' s not like HW ' s " read my lips : no new taxes " . 	0

WTP	13925	Most people reading the article will not be familiar with the creed , and it is so important , it deserves being there in full . 	0
WTP	13926	My main objection to change would be the amount of work necessary to re-order the article and re-write . 	0
WTP	13927	The section is probably too long , as I have already said . 	0

WTP	14078	That CCHR is a " pseudoskeptical organization " is just a judgment of a Fyslee ( I tend to agree FWIW ) , but even if it was a judgment of another reliable source , that still doesn ' t disqualify the CCHR as a notable skeptical organization which has characterized something as pseudoscience . 	0

WTP	14165	I guess the most important thing to do now is to complete the to do list . 	0
WTP	14166	But this article is not a definitive " List of pseudosciences " but rather a " List of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
WTP	14167	CCHR is clearly not a reliable source for declaring what is and what isn ' t a pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	14168	Does this make sense ? 	0
WTP	14169	Characterized = point of view and hence this article should adhere to NPOV by presenting all significant POVs . 	0
WTP	14170	I will try to help you as much as I can since I am very interested in this subject and I think we could make this not just a good but a featured article one day . 	0
WTP	14171	Richard , this looks good . 	0
WTP	14172	If you want me to nitpick for a possible improvement I would say scrap the hearse pic and here ' s why . 	1
WTP	14173	This then raises the question of NPOV , which seems to be violated by granting undue weight to the sex abuse scandals . 	0
WTP	14174	Now , if the argument is that the article can ' t be FA unless the lead includes the sex abuse scandals , and we want FA rather than follow WP guidelines , well that ' s ok with me . 	0
WTP	14175	The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church . 	0

WTP	14179	The position Ling . 	0
WTP	14180	Nut advocates distorts historical perspective ; compared with other controversies , the sex abuse scandals are barely notable , and including it in the lead gives them far more than their due weight . 	0
WTP	14181	The other passage from WP : LEAD that applies here : " Well-publicized recent events affecting an article subject , whether controversial or not , should be kept in historical perspective . 	0

WTP	14216	As I said before , this is fine to note in the kernel ' s history ( both here and in the main article ) , but the previous wording and positioning was somewhat questionable . 	0
WTP	14217	Indeed . 	0
WTP	14218	I strongly believe that both labels apply to these controversies ( especially the T-shirt one ) , and the article should follow a more general tone anyway . 	0
WTP	14219	The dense population of civilians in the Gaza war zone does make this different that the " dozens and hundreds " of other midsize operations and even wars , a point made by both sides in the conflict as well as outside bodies . 	0
WTP	14220	AND Please note : had either the main IDF page or its Talk page been marked with a " semiprotected " banner , I ' d have been cautioned that new content is being subjected to strict review . . . instead , it just got cut out and now we ' re both spending a lot of time trying to achieve some understanding about why your outline in effect prohibits content that doesn ' t conform due to " undue weight " . 	0
WTP	14221	There I found the allegations of phosphorus weapon use , so I proceeded to add a few tightly written sentences including citations plus internal and external links . 	0
WTP	14222	So is the " undue weight " argument that that these allegations and countercharges among young Israeli soldiers , with serious repercussions throughout Israeli society , isn ' t as " heavy " as charges of phosphorus weapons use and can ' t appear beside it ? 	0
WTP	14223	I felt the content is relevant in light of interest among the English-language readership ( some of whom are likely to view it as fuel for criticism of the IDF and Israel ; hence my unfortunate use here of the terms " atrocities and war crimes " that I trusted was certainly not to be read as any agenda of my own ! ) . 	0
WTP	14224	It seemed to me a clear case relating to the Israel Defense Forces # Code of Conduct ( not , as you suggest , Purity of Arms ) — but as there ' s no specific incident under that heading , I posted under the heading Controversy . 	0
WTP	14225	I still feel that we ' re not communicating " on the same page " in this exchange ! 	1
WTP	14226	I am NOT talking about " bodies criticizing , " but rather IDF combat soldiers relating after the events to their situation in the field vis-a-vis their commanders , comrades at arms , soldiers under their command , and the population in the war zone . 	0

WTP	14243	I tend to agree that we have a choice : either ( 1 ) include all reliably-sourced categorizations , including historical ones ( with a note as to the change in attitude ) and single-sourced ones , again with a note when the view is contrary to an overwhelming scientific consensus ( Darwinism ) . 	0

WTP	14256	I DID NOT " twist your words " . 	1
WTP	14257	You claimed that U . S . / israeli actions are " military " whereas Hamas ' actions are " targeting civilians " . . . . . . and now are citing the Geneva Conventions … . ok … . 	0
WTP	14258	Please . . . . . . when you DO make this argument . . . . . . . . remember to include all of the evidence that israeli " military action " has been successful in advancing israel ' s war against the Palestinians / Lebonese ( gaining military advantages anticipated ) . 	0
WTP	14259	Here ' s MY evidence that this is NOT true : http://a.abcnews.com/m/screen?id=6760726&pid=76 http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/palestinian-attacks-signal-failure-of-military-offensive-652232.html http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,244139,00.html http://www.ifamericansknew.org/stats/un.html http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article692233.ece 4 . 	1
WTP	14260	. . . so the Geneva Conventions DON ' T support your argument that Hamas ' actions differ from those of U . S . / israel . 	0
WTP	14261	No doubt you will bring attention to the statement : " . . . would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated " . . . in order to argue that U . S . / israeli actions are " necessary " and achieve a ( relatively ) successful military goal and that , in turn , justify the actions making them allowable by the standards of the convention . 	0

WTP	14267	Why are you pushing this common creationist falsehood about Popper ? 	0
WTP	14268	I don ' t think we should only treat the scientific aspects as a default , though we need much more material on this subject than we currently have , and as I mentioned I think the length of the culture section gives undue weight at its current size , though it could probably be expanded much further still with ease . 	0
WTP	14269	As for only treating scientific aspects , that ' s what we used to do , but the culture article was merged here to cover it all in one subject . 	0
WTP	14270	We need much more input on this , as we currently only have one person for splitting ( me ) and one against . 	1

WTP	14274	So I think the only solution is to open an RFC , which I will do below . 	1
WTP	14275	Unfortunately , the two sides are deadlocked : both cling to their preferred wording and resist any possibility of a compromise wording . 	0
WTP	14276	I have no particular attachment to the form of words I proposed , just a desire to see some wording agreed which roughly accommodates the various perspectives at play here and indicates to the reader that they will need more detail to fully understand what happened . 	0
WTP	14277	I make it $2 . 7 billion for 2009 , rising $150 million every year for the next ten . 	1

WTP	14280	This is a situation I have seen happen before on Irish articles . 	0
WTP	14281	Two sentences do not warrant an individual section . 	0
WTP	14282	It ' s ofcourse not necessary to have a gallery as it says " The gallery tag is not a tool to shoehorn images into an article , and a gallery consisting of an indiscriminate collection of images of the article subject should generally either be improved in accordance with the above paragraph or moved to Wikimedia Commons . " 	1
WTP	14283	This is sensible advice because linking someone ' s words to a Wiki article can impose a meaning on those words that is not contained in the statement they made and consequently it can mislead readers . 	0
WTP	14284	My understanding of that statement is that it means , if it is possible to avoid linking from within quotes , avoid linking from within quotes . 	0
WTP	14285	Also Ibranoff , if you are going to keeping insisting " The sources clearly state that they are not nu metal " , you need to provide those sources so they can be evaluated . 	0
WTP	14286	' Zionist regime ' is a redirect to ' Zionist entity ' , so your links were to ' Zionist entity ' as Wayne said . 	1

WTP	14288	Just saying that HIV and AIDS share too much info isn ' t specific , especially as both topics share so much ground and providing similar context shouldn ' t be surprising . 	1

WTP	14290	I ' m not sure what you ' ve addressed previously that we ' ve avoided exactly . 	0

WTP	14296	As for my " very weird silly argument " , there is nothing weird or silly about actions based on WP : MOSQUOTE . 	1
WTP	14297	OK , but as it is repeated , should the copy in the lede stay ? 	1
WTP	14298	I would suggest no , and to keep the copy in the Beliefs section . 	1
WTP	14299	In the lede it sounds quite a bit more specific and indeed almost narrow in context , whereas the rest of the lede is very general , broad , and top-down sounding . 	0
WTP	14300	However , given that I am hearing one " doesn ' t matter " and one ( apparently ) " no keep as is " , I am glad I brought it up first , and any further input welcome and indeed desired . 	0
WTP	14301	Further , I find it curious that I am being urged by several people ( unquestionably dedicated , but perhaps a bit narrow-minded ) to " use the Talk page " when those same people have repeatedly avoided addressing some of the issues I have raised here on Talk about the usability of this article . 	1
WTP	14302	Well , that might sounds a little pov as it might be different to everyone . 	0
WTP	14303	But I do agree with you . 	0
WTP	14304	I ' d be quite happy to see all flags decommissioned from this article . 	0
WTP	14305	As for the ' I don ' t like it ' comment , I don ' t mind these images at all , I ' m just looking for the most suitable one , and preferably not one that ' s going to be removed every few days by someone who objects to it . 	0
WTP	14306	Now to address your point Bleh - your argument regarding sexual images is moot ; there are of course such images at commons if people want to see them , just as there are plenty of gory images of dead people and such , but there is no photograph on sexual intercourse of two individuals at the height of copulation . 	0
WTP	14307	Regarding pictures from long past wars , there obviously won ' t be anything in the form of a photograph , but there plenty of paintings etc . I had a very brief look for something suitable but there was nothing that especially caught my eye . 	0
WTP	14308	There is already a picture from a 20th century war just below in the suicide attack section , as well as the image of American graves in the lead , so I believe it would be more balanced to include something from times long past , like artwork from a chariot battle for example . 	0
WTP	14309	There is no need to show the most graphic or pornographic image just because one is available , and if an image is controversial for whatever reason there should be at least some rationale for keeping it . 	0
WTP	14310	It probably doesn ' t deserve any more than a sentence but not mentioning it could be seen as inconsistent with NPOV requirements . 	0
WTP	14311	Here are some examples but there are many , many more . 	0
WTP	14312	It is used by mainstream RS both in their narrative voice and when they quote prominent sources who use the term routinely . 	0
WTP	14313	< - I don ' t think it ' s reasonable to entirely dismiss the IOF term . 	1
WTP	14314	It would not preclude attributing the material to the author of the work , but as such that should probably be made explicit for clarity . 	0
WTP	14315	What it does preclude is simply attribution of its material to the institutional church itself , as that would be the posterchild of original research . 	0
WTP	14316	Just two cents : the lack of either decree does not in and of itself preclude the use of a source here . 	1
WTP	14317	Glad everyone got back on track here . 	0
WTP	14318	That has been gone over already , Dynablaster provided a list of secondary sources , just waiting for him to include them . 	0
WTP	14319	The official English translation is an original statement by Ahmadinejad and the Iranian government , just as the Persian statement is . 	0

WTP	14321	Any suggestions for improvement ? 	0
WTP	14322	This is the perfect example of a time when primary sources should be used . 	0
WTP	14323	Censoring the official Iranian government statement is anti-scholarly . 	0

WTP	14380	I ' m overwhelmed . 	0
WTP	14381	Even though I fail to see the meaning of that article , and how it contradicts this one , it is more accurate in its depict of the musical interrelations of the early bands , with emphasis on Black Sabbath . . 	0
WTP	14382	but hey , that ' s the case with a few 100 , 000 articles here on this second hand source page . 	0
WTP	14383	How do you know Black Sabbath ' s importance is false , a myth ? 	0
WTP	14384	The comment about " over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation " strikes me as odd : not only unsupported by WP , but contradicting the scientific nature of this topic which has inspired very careful research for over two decades . 	1
WTP	14385	The paragraph where Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , and Led Zeppelin are mentioned as pioneers of the genre is invalid ; it states that all three bands were reviled by critics . 	1
WTP	14386	First off , Deep Purple met indifference in their start , which is not the same as being reviled , which their albums never were . 	0
WTP	14387	With their success that followed in the U . S . , they were , however , acclaimed . 	0
WTP	14388	Secondly , Led Zeppelin never met criticism like that of Black Sabbath ; Zeppelin were , instead , criticized for not being as good as , according to Rolling Stone in the review of their first album , like The Jeff Beck Group , and Robert Plant was compared condescendingly to Rod Stewart . 	0
WTP	14389	Basically , not the same kind of criticism Black Sabbath got . 	0
WTP	14390	Sabbath were persistently rejected until their fifth album ( I dislike referring to wikipedia articles , but this is backed by the articles for all their first five albums ) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
WTP	14391	The criticism was a direct result of their alien-sounding music , which clashed with the current , which was blues-inspired Hard rock , like Zeppelin , Purple , Iron Butterfly etc . To conclude , the introduction falters and misleads , and should be rewritten more accurately . 	0

WTP	14436	What it does tell us , in conjunction with the other article from prominent pre-1900 members of the church is that there was a discussion about Smith ' s claims to have seen a Vision and that vision involved God . 	0

WTP	14438	All Gore tried that one , and well maybe we should believe him , after all he did invent the internet and has does have a Bachelor ' s degree in Government . 	0

WTP	14440	If it did happen , how would including it detract from its relevance ? 	0
WTP	14441	Smith did not claim to " frequently seeing God " just as you say , however what is interesting about this article is when it is taken in context with Smith ' s own writings of how the community received his ideas does support his claims , if somewhat indirectly . 	0

WTP	14444	As for Professor Anderson ' s and other LDS scholars seeming disqualification because they are LDS , from what basis is that authoritative dismissal given ? 	0

WTP	14468	I think what Wassupwestcoast is trying to say is that the scandal here is not really that a few priests did awful things , but that the church as an organization covered it up . 	0

WTP	14471	The coverage in this article has focused more on the individual priests , when it really should instead talk about the bishops who moved priests around without informing the new dioceses of past problems . 	0
WTP	14472	I haven ' t seen evidence that the level of cover-up that occurred in the RCC has also occurred in Protestant denominations ; if that ' s just my ignorance , then info on Protestant coverups could be offered as a comparison . 	0
WTP	14473	Technically its right , but it could give the wrong impression hence the debate - - 	0

WTP	14486	When you look through most other photos , you see the caption is a description given to what the user sees in the photo . 	0
WTP	14487	As I understand it , a caption given by an uploader or by a flikr stream owner is unverifiable and as such not according to WP standards . 	0
WTP	14488	Often it adds information that is only evident to a professional ( explaining that the rhino in the picture is an african rhino ) but a caption should not add information not evident in the photo ( explaining that the rhino ' s name is Susan ) , unless this information can be sourced . 	0
WTP	14489	Unfortunately , it ' s a Pay-Per-View , and I can only get the title and first line , though these are clear enough to illustrate my point . 	0

WTP	14509	So the best thing to do is to just give a percentage . 	1
WTP	14510	As for your point , I have little to add to what Htonl has said , which is accurate . 	0

WTP	14539	This proves , beyond the possibility of argument , that Palestine IS a state , and therefore under U . S . law , cannot be included under the definition of " terrorism " . 	1
WTP	14540	Since Hamas is now the legal , governing political party of the state / country of Palestine , they can no longer be considered as a " terrorist organization " ( under U . S . law ) . 	0

WTP	14560	Your pretense at neutrality by noting that a shock propaganda photo of a dead mom ( a very rare victim of a botched illegal abortion ) is also prohibited ( to suggest the " rule " is balanced ) is extremely transparent . 	0

WTP	14567	However , since the lead effectively dictates the article as a whole , it is much more appropriate to tag the entire article . 	1

WTP	14570	I am perplexed that you two ( Eldereft and Fyslee ) are saying that the tag should be removed , when all efforts to install such a tag have been summarily reverted without the benefit of a proper discussion . 	1

WTP	14574	The situation is that it qualifies as Questionable science , and because " some critics allege to be pseudoscience , may contain information to that effect , but generally should not be so characterized . " 	0

WTP	14576	Who knows , at some point in time psychoanalysis may become a historical artifact that will easily fall into the " Generally considered pseudoscience " or " Obvious pseudoscience " class , and we ' ll then be justified in adding PS category tags to the articles ! 	0

WTP	14597	As I ' ve pointed out before , it has been enough of an issue in the UK that a previous Archbishop of Cardiff had to resign over his handling of abuse cases , and Cormac Murphy-O ' Connor also received pretty major coverage for his handling of a case when he was at Arundel ( less justifiably in that case certainly ) . 	0

WTP	14616	I disagree with this , and feel that use of the term ( heavy metal ) throughout the ' 70s was largely consistent with modern standards , and much of the crossing of " hard rock " and " heavy metal " very probably arose from the fact that many hard rock bands of the time did a few metal songs . 	0

WTP	15258	Feel free to rewrite the section , but please try not to place undue weight on recent events ( Cast Lead , and even the 2006 Lebanon War attracted undue attention on Wikipedia in general , unlike for example the much bigger 1956 Sinai War ) . 	0
WTP	15259	Now , I agree that the controversy section is severely lacking ( in quality , not length ) , and IMO one of the reasons is that this article does not have many dedicated editors . 	0
WTP	15260	There is no reason to detail each incident , and certainly not in the context of soldiers ' coming out ' to ' reveal ' something about the IDF , as indeed there is an entire organization in Israel devoted to this very purpose , which is not mentioned even once in the article . 	0
WTP	15261	Even if many notable organizations accuse the IDF of war crimes here , the article should take a more general approach , such as " The IDF was accused of war crimes for its actions in several operations , including Sabra and Shatila and Operation Cast Lead . [ ref ] " . 	0
WTP	15262	Therefore , I fail to see how something like this would not be undue weight for the article . 	1

WTP	15318	In standard Christian terminology , which would have been understood by Smith , the word sect does not necessarily mean precisely the same thing as church . 	0

WTP	15352	I ' m removing this , because as previously discussed POZ is not a reliable source : " The dissidents assert that epidemiological cofactors are required , along with HIV , in order for a person to contract AIDS . 	0
WTP	15353	There is presumption ( logical and statistically supported , but still presumption ) of HIV infection as the cause of their deaths . 	0
WTP	15354	In addition , the fact that some HIV-positive people did not get AIDS after many years , as well as the fact that a cure or prevention has still not been discovered , supported the hypothesis that other conditions ( cofactors ) besides HIV infection might be necessary ; that is , AIDS may result from a combination of causes .

WTP	15420	In fact , there was no country or state prior to 1910 with the structure and geographical area of the Union , which is why that date is universally regarded as the date on which South Africa as it exists today was " born " . 	0

WTP	15433	More extensive description should , IMO , address issues such as the fact that most AIDS victims in Africa were never confirmed as HIV positive by testing . 	1
WTP	15434	I have previously commented in Talk on the irrelevance of social issues such as orphans in the lead of an article about a virus ( which is NOT the same as the syndrome , which is a specific medical term distinct from disease ) . 	0
WTP	15435	To me , this suggests that the HIV article needs " more extensive description " , including possible revision of the lead . 	1
WTP	15436	The page on undue weight includes this : Other minority views may require much more extensive description of the majority view in order to avoid misleading the reader . 	0
WTP	15437	Thus , we see what is IMO a blatant POV term such as " denialism " instead of skepticism or " alternative explanations " in the section heading that gives lip service to other viewpoints . 	0
WTP	15438	This also suggests that the preponderance of media repetition of known information about HIV and AIDS may create the impression that minority views are " tiny " ( a subjective term ) . 	1

WTP	15473	The problem with setting down a figure like 3-4000 in isolation is that it has no context . 	1
WTP	15474	Just like the headline figure of 4 , 00o clerics accused of sex abuse in the US , it has no context unless you add that in the 40 year period covered there were hundreds of thousands of priests and religious serving in the US . 	0
WTP	15475	The original sources , one of which was Kamen , actually said that the Spanish Inquisition sentenced 3-4% of convicted people to death over its existence , ( technically , released to the civil authority , ) but that only half of these executions were actually carried out . 	0
WTP	15476	I didn ' t quibble about the original quotation , since more qualification would only have made the article longer . 	1

WTP	15508	This means including the strange yet notable viewpoints of organizations such as CoS . 	0
WTP	15509	If we are going to base our inclusion criteria on characterizations ( viewpoints ) then the article must adhere to the rigors of what NPOV says about viewpoints - in essence , this article must represent all significant viewpoints fairly . 	0
WTP	15510	As it stands now though , the article allows for the inclusion of items which are not pseudosciences - yet they are included in the list because some notable source has characterized it as such . 	0
WTP	15511	Again , if this article was simply " List of Pseudosciences " where we could only include entries that are either obvious pseudosciences or generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community , then we would not be dealing with this NPOV issue . 	0
WTP	15512	" Pseudoscience " is the characterization du jour and Scientology is a notable source ( not a reliable source of labelling something " pseudoscience " , but a notable source nonetheless which has made such a characterization ) . 	0
WTP	15513	But this article is not simply a list of pseudosciences ; it is rather a list of characterizations made by notable sources . 	0
WTP	15514	If this article were just a list of pseudosciences , then I would agree entirely with you - that Scientology ' s distorted view of science precludes it from representing the scientific community as a whole . 	0

WTP	15879	Failure to extensively cover the constant attacks that are the stuff of politics in a biography of a person does not represent a political bias in favor of that person , it is an encyclopedic approach to writing biographies . 	1

WTP	15884	However , it is in danger of turning into an edit war , and both sides should discuss the issue here to seek consensus . 	0
WTP	15885	This is not vandalism , it is a content . 	0
WTP	15886	I can see two solutions : Personally , I prefer my suggested " technically left and rejoined " wording , because with the addition of only 3 extra words it conveys a much richer picture of what happened than either of two disputed versions . 	1
WTP	15887	The full situation is explained rather well in a succinct paragraph in the history section , but the " rejoined " summary in the intro could mislead the reader into believing that Northern Ireland tried out life in the Free State for a while before packing its bags and going back to London . 	0
WTP	15888	This sort of technical hiatus applies in all sorts of situations , and should of course be described where the issue is considered in detail … but in a one-sentence summary to describe the situation solely as a " rejoining " is misleading . 	1

WTP	15898	So , given that this article is not a list of definitive pseudosciences but rather just a list of topics that have been characterized as such , to exist and still satisfy WP : NPOV , this article must represent " fairly , and as far as possible without bias , all significant views that have been published by reliable sources " . 	0

WTP	15908	Dance-Pop is a fusion genre of Dance Music and Pop Music it is a mix and fusion genres are not allowed into a template according to " Infobox Musical Artist Template " So Dance would probably be a genre for her cause it was on all of her three albums . 	1

WTP	15918	The added benefit here is that you don ' t have any PoV implications . 	0
WTP	15919	In a summary ( that is supposed to be simple ) why confuse and mislead the reader with unimportant technicalities that are absolutely meaningless in the long run ? 	0
WTP	15920	The situation was straightforward and very simple : Therefore , north stays and south leaves . 	0
WTP	15921	Who cares about the meaningless details in a transitional process when all that ' s important is the end result . 	0
WTP	15922	For a summary , keep the key facts that allow a new reader to understand what happened . 	0
WTP	15923	Adding the word ' technically ' may be correct to an extent , but is still misleading in a summary for someone who knows nothing about Ireland . 	0
WTP	15924	BrownHairedGirl - I am against your ' compromise ' proposal , because they are essentially no different than what " O ' Fenian " initially has said , and still implies the same PoV that he wants . 	1
WTP	15925	Why in a summary are there no details about many of the other events during the Viking and Norman ages , but for this particular event you feel compelled to add minute and misleading detail . 	0
WTP	15926	O ' Fenian has made it clear that he wants the article to imply that partition was the fault of unionists , and for you to add one more word in detail does no more to remove that PoV . 	0

WTP	15929	I must remind you that Wikipedia is not censored Yes we may have things here that you may find objectionable but that is not a reason to not include the content if it is freely licensed and appropriate for the topic ( death ) , death and destruction is not pretty and perhaps those who promote it will reconsider after seeing the end results , it ' s not a picture of capital punishment , but appropriate for the murder / homicide section if there is one in this article . 	1

WTP	15944	So as to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good , I would strongly suggest drafting a way to mention it in the lede , even if only a very minimal mention , so as to discourage such understandable but in the end not helpful edits . 	1
WTP	15945	While I fully agree with the concerns of recentism and historical balance ( consider in 1000 years what this article would look like : this flap would barely get a footnote if that ! ) , I also recognize the empirical reality Karanacs and others have mentioned , that if no mention is made in the lede , editors less informed about the editorial issues here will even in good faith bombard it with edits to mention it . 	0

WTP	15972	Steve Whitmire was not officially named as Henson ' s successor for Kermit until MUCH later , and his first appearance performing Kermit was in the special the Muppet did remembering Jim Henson . 	0
WTP	15973	( Outdent ) For the sake of accuracy , it must be noted that Crowley MORE THAN ONCE claimed to be a Freemason . 	0
WTP	15974	It seems that Crowley was asked to become a Freemason but was thrown out of the United Grand Lodge almost immediately . 	1

WTP	15981	It ' s good to appear unbias , but this ideal should not take away from the facts of history , that have been thoroughly researched . 	0
WTP	15982	The scholars and research into the Book of Mormon show this statement to be historically accurate . 	0

WTP	15987	I have read the other comments , but they don ' t contradict this statement as I recall ; they simply assert that sexual abuse is more of a world wide problem . 	1
WTP	15988	That is a different statement from the vast majority of the abuse is in the U . S . - - 	0
WTP	15989	Is your issue with stating " vast majority " ? 	0

WTP	15992	Biodiversity does not have to increase . 	1
WTP	15993	The current trees produced go back to approx 550 million years back ( based on Cambrian explosion ) , that is our tree of biodiversity based on fossils , molecular similarity , etc etc . The fact that the tree converges to a common ancestor is based on evidence quite different from the evidence used to justify our current tree for biodiversity . 	1
WTP	15994	That ' s why biodiversity and common ancestor are two different theories that complement each other . 	0
WTP	15995	Saying that drift and selection do not produce diversity is therefore a very wrong statement . 	1
WTP	15996	You have to differentiate biodiversity from common ancestor . 	0
WTP	15997	Mutations , by themselves , will never produce diversity without a mechanism to retain the beneficial ones . 	0
WTP	15998	So mutation is the raw material for these two mechanisms to produce diversity . 	0
WTP	15999	You are very confused about evolution . 	0
WTP	16000	Drift and selection are mechanisms that act on mutations to produce diversity . 	0

WTP	16009	This is not an article which list things that are pseudoscience ; rather it is an article which list things that have been characterized as pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	16010	My thought here is that since this is merely an article of significant points of view , that CCHR is in fact a reliable source of their organization ' s point of view . 	0
WTP	16011	Of course sentimental patriots among homesick members of the Lebanese diaspora just love to hear about their intrepid and successful Phoenician ancestors — and so much like the modern Lebanese themselves , needless to say . . . " Popular " indeed , in every sense . 	0

WTP	16019	However , your addition introduced some content that may need better verification or qualification ; I see that the only source verifying criticism of Obama and / or BP — and it undoubtedly exists — is the Christian Science Monitor ( who , I ' ll hazard a guess , supported exploratory off-shore drilling before this happened ) , and I don ' t really think they ' re a reliable source . 	1

WTP	16045	Basically everything that ' s played in a minor pentatonic scale ( the final verses are in natural minor , the common minor scale , which is used by guys like Beethoven , for example ) is blues to you , and that ' s a very amateur approach , I must say . 	0
WTP	16046	I have already remarked on your less knowledgeable status as a musician which is clearly visible ; the final verses of " Black Sabbath " are in a minor scale and not bluesy in any way , but since you see them as blues , I kind of get where you ' re coming from . 	0

WTP	16118	As for Grand Funk , I kind of doubt that Sabbath never heard them ( Grand Funk was actually covered by a South African group before 1973 ) but I guess that doesn ' t particularly matter . 	1
WTP	16119	I agree that Sabbath and Deep Purple weren ' t as bluesy as Zeppelin , but I still don ' t think Sabbath takes a ( very large ) step away from those influences in Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
WTP	16120	Ah . 	0
WTP	16121	The term apparently did exist by that point ( the first use by a critic according to this article was in 1968 ) , though it seemingly ( again , according to this article and its sources ) wasn ' t used by a writer in a context ( relatively ) in line with its current until 1971 on Sir Lord Baltimore . 	0

WTP	16125	I think maybe anywhere from In Rock to Machine Head could have been it , though I think their ' 60s material was much more exclusively hard rock . 	0
WTP	16126	" Highway Star " is sort of the prototype for a lot of speed metal and flashy ' 80s stuff , while " War Pigs " was obviously very influential to a lot of the doom metal and ' stoner metal ' material from the ' 70s ( Pentagram , Bedemon ) on . 	0

WTP	16134	I want to see citations to EMPIRICAL evidence references that contradict my edits to the lead . 	1
WTP	16135	That being said , many people , but not all , with AIDS test positive for HIV . 	1
WTP	16136	To date , there is NOT ONE SINGLE study , paper , reproducible experiment , photograph , video or lab result that supports HIV being the cause if AIDS . 	0
WTP	16137	The word empirical denotes information gained by means of observation , experience , or experiment .

WTP	16138	Before you make biased and uneducated statements regarding a degree of scientific and linguistic comprehension that are being debated by Nobel Laureates , scientists , doctors and researches the globe over , perhaps you should read a REFERENCE or two supporting your statements . 	0

WTP	16140	So I pose this alternative to my edits . . . 	0
WTP	16141	There are another 10% of the HIV + population that have never developed AIDS despite not taking ARVs . 	0

WTP	16143	The CNN article said that : " Before undergoing the transplant , the patient was also found to be infected with low levels of a type of HIV known as X4 , which does not use the CCR5 receptor to infect cells . 	0
WTP	16144	A rough analogy would be Al Capone operated Soup Kitchens in the 1930 some people considered him a gangster 	0
WTP	16145	Keepcalmandcarryon , I did not state that the treatment causes resistance to CXCR4 I merely pointed out that Hutter ' s patient did have the CXCR4 virus before the treatment which is a fact . 	1
WTP	16146	In one of the edits you reverted I had added a CNN article as a reference which had information about this issue . 	0
WTP	16147	" This finding is very surprising . " 	0
WTP	16148	As such the use of the term " Resistance to CCR5 inhibition is also less important if CXCR4 strains of HIV emerge ( these use CXCR4 rather than CCR5 as a coreceptor , from which they become independent ) , and the patient carried this virus at low levels " is fairly deceptive since it implies that this treatment does nothing for the CXCR4 virus . 	1
WTP	16149	However , following the transplant , signs of leukemia and HIV were absent . 	0
WTP	16150	" There is no really conclusive explanation why we didn ' t observe any rebound of HIV , " Hutter said . 	0

WTP	16155	I ' m sure we can find some mainstream criticisms of certain aspects of psychiatry from truly skeptical sources . 	0
WTP	16156	I also want to add that the Siena College Poll is a well respected poll for Presidential rankings , and has been one of the main contributors to those rankings for almost 30 years . 	0

WTP	16158	The kilt would make sense if it took place before he broke with ex-Master Mason MacGregor Mathers , and with Mathers ' old patron Westcott , who at that point ran the original Societas Rosicruciana . 	0
WTP	16159	When did this supposedly happen ? 	0
WTP	16160	Looks good to me . 	0
WTP	16161	But anyway , even if it were a criticism we don ' t divide the article into criticism and praise sections , but rather work things into the right article ( s ) in due proportion to their biographical importance and relevance . 	0
WTP	16162	The birther stuff is somewhere between a fringe conspiracy theory and a political smear . 	0

WTP	16169	Im sorry but the wording is currently VERY misleading and such inaccurate statements should not be allowed to remain for too long . 	0

WTP	16174	If Israel were sincerely concerned about peace and minimizing civilian casualties , it would end the siege in Gaza and negotiate with the Palestinian resistance . 	0
WTP	16175	The fact that Israel dropped bombs on civilian areas in one of the most densely populated regions of the world is overwhelming evidence that the intent was to kill civilians . 	1
WTP	16176	My comment was related to the former . 	0
WTP	16177	The latter admittedly has less information about its review system , but is there a reason for your assertion that it was not peer-reviewed ? 	0

WTP	16334	It is a violation of WP : SYNTH , as well as a logical fallacy known as poisoning the well . 	0
WTP	16335	I ' ve already addressed that argument , several times : Putting aside the veracity of the claim that the charge was " rejected " in the Hezbollah case ( it was not ) , it is irrelevant editorializing to imply that what was claimed in one different instance ( different time , different place , different organization ) is also the case in this instance . 	1
WTP	16336	In the discussion above under the heading Misleading Description of Partition , editors are unable to agree on a form of summary wording to use in the lead section of this article to describe the fate of Northern Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Treaty . 	1
WTP	16337	One side insists that it is right to say that Northern Ireland " remained in the United Kingdom " ; the other prefers to say that it " rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
WTP	16338	From what I can see , neither side is wrong , but it appears that the reality is more complex than is implied by either of those short phrases . 	0
WTP	16339	The underlying facts do not seem to be in dispute , and are set out in detail both later this article at Ireland # History and also in Northern Ireland # History . 	0
WTP	16340	The treaty provided that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State , but would have the right to opt out and become part of the United Kingdom . 	1
WTP	16341	There appears to be agreement that there was clear expectation on all sides that it would do so , and this was done immediately after the treaty came into effect . 	1
WTP	16342	The whole process , which involved the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland travelling overland to London to personally present the documents , took 48 hours . 	1
WTP	16343	I have seen no suggestion either in this discussion or in related articles that at any point in those 48 hours the Irish Free State had any practical control of affairs within Northern Ireland . 	0
WTP	16344	So I suggested a compromise wording : " technically left and rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
WTP	16345	That has been rejected by both sides , with demands for references for the use of the adjective " technically " . 	0

WTP	16347	I know this section is about defining " terrorist tactics " … … . . 	0
WTP	16348	you obviously would like to use " international political definitions " when it suits your position ( as you just stated ) but will ignore these same references when your position is refuted ( as stated above with the U .

WTP	16351	As well as the sentence been recentist , it paints a bias athiest / protestant centric picture that in the modern day , the Catholic Church has no worth and its only standing is for the sensationalistic American media to whine about its followers and highlight some of the negatives ( sex abuse scandal ) , while giving attention to none of the positives . 	0
WTP	16352	That is over 1 billion people challenging the controversy of an athiest pro-death stance ( see how easy words can be twisted to suit a POV ? ) . 	1

WTP	16357	Dunno about the Warsaw Ghetto , but the inescapable fact is that SF is a haven for gay / lesbian , etc . , folks , who are , let ' s not forget , still subject to measurable levels of discrimination , threats , intimidation , etc . , elsewhere . 	0
WTP	16358	this is a very important aspect of how NOT the official name of the army of israel is used ! 	0
WTP	16359	As for etymologies , as I note above , you clearly had no problem with keeping in the article the fact that the word referring to the animal has changed in English because you didn ' t remove the mention of it in your original edit . 	1
WTP	16360	Therefore I fail to see how taking the logical next step and explaining why this happened , with multiple reliable sources to back it up , is a problem . 	0
WTP	16361	Regarding the " jarring " nature of the word . . . look , I can sympathise . 	0

WTP	16363	Maybe slightly more so in American English than British English as you indicate , but by no means is it something you ' d say in conversation with an elderly relative in the UK   ; ) However , as I am sure you are very much aware , Wikipedia is not censored . 	1

WTP	16367	You yourself partly justified Elizabeth ' s repressions by referring to the threat of invasion and internal rebellion . 	0
WTP	16368	That ' s fairly obvious , just like a history or pattern of lies , misbehavior or criminal behavior by Hamas would be relevant when they seemed to state a similar lie in 2008 or were accused of similar misbehavior or criminal behavior in 2008 or 2009 . 	0
WTP	16369	But my reference in the " Proximity to Civilians . . . " section to the Salon article about Hezbollah - - " the same accusation was rejected when it was made during Israel ' s 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon . [ 184 ] " - - has been repeatedly removed here without explanation . 	0

WTP	16375	With regard to the English reformation , things like the disembowelment of priests , the Pilgrimage of Grace , the Prayer Book rebellion , the Northern Rising and the massacres of catholics that followed haven ' t been mentioned . 	0
WTP	16376	Nor does the passage emphasize the fact that in most countries the Reformation was state-imposed , people were forced to accept the new religion , their churches , church properties and the fruits of their donations were seized and handed over to the princes , and their worship forbidden . 	0
WTP	16377	You haven ' t addressed the argument above at all . 	0
WTP	16378	No one has . 	0
WTP	16379	Again , the section title is " close proximity to civilians , " a charge by Israel against Hamas , and Israel made precisely the same charge against Hezbollah . 	0
WTP	16380	Comment Well , it would be strange to " support " myself , but to repeat it : I think that the article needs a lead image that stands for " death " as broadly as possible , at least broadly for human death , which is what the article does focus on . 	0
WTP	16381	Instead of the painting ( which I inserted after suggesting it here and receiving no response for several days ) I would also agree with any other image of a human skull , although I think that the painting is very fitting . 	0

WTP	16393	Using the word sects , but quoting it , clues in the reader that Smith ' s 1830s use of the term may not necessarily mean what the modern reader might think . 	0
WTP	16394	It also lets us side-step the question of Smith ' s precise meaning . 	0
WTP	16395	I doubt the term sect had the same pejorative connotation in the 1830s as it does today , though certainly Smith was antisectarian , and like any Christian primitivist in the 1820s thought that sects and denominations were a corruption of the Christian church . 	1
WTP	16396	But rather than trying to parse the primary sources ourselves ( which could be [ [ WP : OR | original research ) , I think we ought to let the secondary sources guide us . 	0
WTP	16397	When Jan Shipps describes the vision story in her Mormonism ( 1985 ) book , page 9 , she uses the word sects in quotes : " this theophany answered the lad ' s question about which of the ' sects ' were right and which were wrong . " 	0
WTP	16398	Maybe that ' s the proper approach . 	1
WTP	16399	I don ' t think it ' s wrong , or necessarily non-neutral , to use a word like church or denomination in this context , but using Smith ' s own language--like Shipps does--has the added advantage of reflecting the flavor of Smith ' s early anti-sectarian views which he shared with other Christian primitivists . 	0
WTP	16400	I know some of the existing secondary sources , like Bushman ' s Smith biography , don ' t really make a distinction between church , denomination , and sect , but that ' s probably just because the authors haven ' t specifically thought of it as an issue . 	0

WTP	16408	' Crucifixion of St . Peter , by Caravaggio ' is also POV from a religious viewpoint and we should look for an alternative for this image . 	1
WTP	16409	Basically the argument boils down to censorship and this is not allowed by policy , and as someone else noted previously above we should have pictures of dead humans or animals to illustrate the topic of death not ' less offensive ' alternatives , some of which are off topic in this article . 	0

WTP	16418	This would be a completely useful list , rather than the mess we are working on now ! 	0
WTP	16419	My guess as to why we haven ' t adopted this obvious and logical solution is that some editors want so badly to associate certain non-pseudoscientific topics with pseudoscience , that they are willing to throw NPOV and logic out the window just for the satisfaction of including such topics in this muddled and unencyclopaedic list . 	0

WTP	16423	The inclusion criteria allows for grey and - per NPOV - all significant grey can and should be included in this list article . 	0
WTP	16424	Now then , if that is a problem for us - if we cannot comply with NPOV - then I suggest ( as I have often suggested ) that this article becomes the very definitive " List of pseudosciences " and adheres strictly to the guidelines of WP : PSCI ( part of NPOV ) ; whereas we would only be able to include items which have been deemed pseudosciences per the general opinion of the scientific community . 	0
WTP	16425	I absolutely see what you are getting at and agree with you fully . 	0
WTP	16426	But where and how do we draw the line ? 	0
WTP	16427	We can ' t just allow some grey and disallow others , because " grey " equals " viewpoints " ( i . e . It is the viewpoint of the Society of Foo Skeptics that foo is pseudoscience . 	0

WTP	16444	Also , most of the afforementioned articles do not share Abortion ' s hot-button pedigree , so there is little comparison between other articles ' use of graphic images and this one ' s failure to do so . 	0
WTP	16445	I cannot say whether graphic images at Gonorrhea , Feces , or Anencephaly add informative value to those articles , but , I don ' t edit them and so I will leave it to the Wikipedians who do to determine what is appropriate there . 	0
WTP	16446	Frankly , the " but other articles do it " defense doesn ' t hold water . 	1
WTP	16447	Other than being uninformative , it is my opinion that such images would detract from the quality of this article , by lessening its stringent adherance to NPOV . 	0
WTP	16448	Thus , their only function would be argumentative , and this is not the role of an encyclopedia . 	0

WTP	16563	There are bands that play ' hard ' ( riff driven , aggressive ) forms of rock , but aren ' t necessarily straight hard rock . 	0
WTP	16564	If they were synonymous , why were certain hard rock artists seldom referred to as heavy metal ? 	0

WTP	16566	I ' m quite aware of the term " heavy metal rock , " and have heard it used . 	0
WTP	16567	When do the sources actually say that ? 	0
WTP	16568	If " hard rock " is vague in any sense other than its direct relation to metal , it ' s because of its use as an umbrella term , which I suspect is only partially connected to hard rock as a genre in-and-of itself . 	1
WTP	16569	From my understanding , it refers to heavy metal . 	0

WTP	16639	It would seem to me not unreasonable to add one sentence under Domestic policy that says something like , " Obama introduced a proposal to expand areas open to off-shore drilling on March 31 , 2010 [ 45 ] . 	1

WTP	16641	I think the lead is just supposed to be a brief summary of what is in the aritcle and can ' t possibly include everything so we can use our judgement on issues like this . 	1

WTP	16646	Multiple users have agreed with me on this point , so I encourage you to expand your horizons a bit — realize there are more specific articles on WP than this one about the First Vision and how Smith was treated in the 1830s — and target your edits about specific details to articles that are about the specific events . 	0

WTP	16656	Works for me . 	0
WTP	16657	While massacres and atrocities were wrought by the crusaders , nowhere does it say that the Church called for or encouraged these massacres but just the opposite - they were appalled and the massacres worked against the goals of the church . 	0
WTP	16658	Not much more than " it exists " is relevant here , so a wikilink would be the way to go . 	1
WTP	16659	There were no criticisms of the Catholic Church in Latin America - every book spoke of the Church taking a stand in every age against the abuses brought upon the people by the Spanish conquistadores and others . 	0
WTP	16660	However , I was surprised myself that what I thought had been the case in these events was actually not what historians thought . 	0
WTP	16661	We have not introduced POV into this article , I intended in every way to show the bad things done by the church throughout the ages in history . 	0

WTP	16700	Again , you ' re incorrect about how you ' re characterizing my edits , even as your own edits bespeak a lack of understanding of ( or a lack of focus on ) the issue . 	1
WTP	16701	The " an oil rig " wording was not created by my edit , it was created by yours . 	0
WTP	16702	http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&diff=prev&oldid=367249190 My wording had been " exploded a Transocean drilling rig " until Scjessey ' s complaint the section was too long after which I reduced it to " exploded a Transocean rig " , which you changed to " exploded an oil rig " , which , as I ' ve already established , created an entirely new link leading to a disambiguation page . 	0
WTP	16703	As to your point about piping , I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic . 	0
WTP	16704	I maintain that finding a Deepwater Horizon link within the phrase " a blowout exploded a Transocean drilling rig " is as intuitive as the example of an appropriate link at the Wikipedia : Piped link # Intuitiveness page you link for me as a tutorial , finding " Pontiac ' s Rebellion # Origins " linked within the phrase " war launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of Native American tribes " . 	0
WTP	16705	Now you ' ve changed it to " an explosion destroyed an offshore rig drilling for oil " , with no link at all , again , as if you ' ve got better things to do than properly edit this featured article . 	0
WTP	16706	( If you thought it worth a link before , why not now ? ) 	0
WTP	16707	The rig was not drilling for oil when it was destroyed by the explosion , as your edit makes it sound . 	1
WTP	16708	In fact , the drilling had completely ceased , or the cementing wouldn ' t have commenced 20 hours earlier ; in fact , the rig was basically done there , and about to undergo a routine check before unhitching from the well site and making way to another drilling location . 	0
WTP	16709	I take it you ' ve not caught much C-SPAN these past six or seven weeks ? 	0
WTP	16710	Please continue to accurately relay that the UN said the statement was a clarification and not a " backing down " or however it was characterized in the press . 	0
WTP	16711	Also , the article should note that the IDF itself stated that it had fired at school premises in early reports on the matter , for example here , and your own BBCNews citation states that Israel had first stated that its mortars had caused " carnage _at_ Fakhura school " ( emphasis added ) . 	1
WTP	16712	Might make a suitable external link , however . 	0

WTP	16724	Getting back to the original point , I think there is a problem in how the sentence infers that these specific bands were reviled by critics , when the point is supposed to be metal as a whole was derided . 	0

WTP	16859	There is no scandal here in the UK despite many journalists looking for one . 	0
WTP	16860	It is primarily a US scandal , and , despite trawling the internet , no-one has produced evidence of any widespreaad world scandal . 	0
WTP	16861	The " scandal " is not " worldwide . 	1
WTP	16862	I have also noticed that the lead mention has expanded as i have predicted , and it will be cut . 	0
WTP	16863	I ' ve looked at the major Wikipedia RCC articles in other languages and none even discuss this so-called worldwide scandal , let alone have it in the lead . 	0
WTP	16864	This does not a worldwide scandal make , however , however much some people might wish one . 	0
WTP	16865	I have alrready said that in an organisation with over a million priests and religious , examples of any crime can be found if you search hard enough . 	0

WTP	16869	Wikipedia has no article called dog , and C . ) 	0
WTP	16870	There are more proofs and evidence suggesting that the content is groundless and untrue manipulated by the current Iran ' s government to justify Ahmadinejad ' s preseidency given that Iranian people have respect and tendency towards educated candidates . 	0
WTP	16871	Thus claiming a ranking system in 1976 , 2 years prior to the revolution , is untrue and groundless . 	0
WTP	16872	Prior to the revolution in Iran in 1978 , each university has its own entrance exam and no ranking system even existed . 	0
WTP	16873	This was the time that the nationwide entrance exam was started as a sample of equity and justice . 	0
WTP	16874	The entrance exam and the ranking system started in 1986-1987 and after the universities re-openned . 	0
WTP	16875	5 ) Iranian universities were closed from 1980 to 1983 due to the post-revolution anarchy . 	0
WTP	16876	4 ) Even if Ahmadinejad had taken the entrance exam in 1990 with almost double population than his time in 1976 , he would have ranked among 150 , 000 and not 400 , 000 ! ! ! 	0
WTP	16877	This is based on capacities as well and the data could confirm the fact that Iranian universities have considerably higher capacities for medical and social sciences than engineering programs . 	0
WTP	16878	The statistics shows that almost always 1 / 5 apply to engineering programs , 2 / 5 social sciences and 2 / 5 medicals . 	0
WTP	16879	It ' s clear they will never admit it , so it has to be highlighted publicly . 	0
WTP	16880	Yeah , there are so many double standards on this article , and this website in general that it would take a massive overhaul of the whole system to clear out the bias of these " editors . " 	0
WTP	16881	Yes , we shouldn ' t base our information on sources that are biased in the other direction . 	0
WTP	16882	On the other hand , a quick glance here shows no mention that there is currently any link between the AGI and PPFA , nor that there has been since 1977 , when " the Alan Guttmacher Institute was incorporated as an independent , not-for-profit organization " . 	0
WTP	16883	There is no vandalism . 	0
WTP	16884	Unless you have some to back up your assertions , this discussion is a dead end . 	0
WTP	16885	" Constant internet debate " is irrelevant here . 	1
WTP	16886	Only reliable secondary sources matter . 	0
WTP	16887	This is heading in an unnecessary and unproductive direction . 	0
WTP	16888	In general , our articles about politicians try to avoid sections devoted to criticism , and avoid criticism generally , because criticism is not really a pertinent biographical fact about people unless it is tied somehow to their life . 	0
WTP	16889	Sometimes a person ' s detractors , or problematic things about them or their actions , are of biographical importance , and they can be included . 	1
WTP	16890	For example , in his book Obama recounted drug use in his youth , something that is a significant part of his life story . 	0
WTP	16891	We don ' t call it a criticism or a controversy , it is simply an event that happened . 	0
WTP	16892	Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative . 	1
WTP	16893	It just doesn ' t work like that - we would have to calibrate Obama ' s article against not only other presidents , but all of his political rivals , those of heads of state of other countries , and so on . 	0
WTP	16894	And to what end ? 	0
WTP	16895	It is not our job here on this page to clean up the Bush article or speculate about what makes Bush a controversial figure , but if it is misfocused you are free to go there and try to improve it . 	0

WTP	16899	His opinions alone produced nothing . 	0
WTP	16900	No , that ' s not at all what science is . 	0
WTP	16901	How exactly is the term " pro-life " not " Catholic " ? 	0
WTP	16902	As far as I know the term is a concise encapsulation of the Church ' s stance on these issues . 	0
WTP	16903	Still , I can see how the article can be improved through something like your suggested edits . 	0
WTP	16904	Strong Oppose - per consistency of every other U . S . city ( except NYC ) 	1
WTP	16905	To stop edit warring leave it out until consensus is reached , but the discussion is somewhat fragmented right now . 	0
WTP	16906	Multiple reverts are never a good idea on this page . 	0
WTP	16907	I don ' t think this content currently can be improved by editing , and the moment it is improved by removal as it isn ' t supported . 	0
WTP	16908	— 	0
WTP	16909	Maybe an article about weapon unloading . 	0
WTP	16910	Maybe in another article , although I can ' t think of one where it would be directly relevant at this point . 	0
WTP	16911	Therefore , it should not be in such a visible article . 	0
WTP	16912	It is clear that anyone not living in Israel would not correctly interpret this picture . 	0
WTP	16913	The patrol is in the territories , so the locals would obviously be settlers , but this is not about " cooperation with settler groups " . 	0
WTP	16914	From what I can tell from the picture , it ' s a joint patrol / weapon unloading by the IDF and local security forces , and this has nothing to do with the " settlement movement " or anything of the sort . 	0
WTP	16915	The above comment shows exactly why this picture shouldn ' t be in this article , as it can be broadly , and incorrectly , interpreted . 	1
WTP	16916	The object of a " theory " is to enduce debate , which in turn stimulates research and which in return bears fruit in the form of a " fact " , creativity is more important that knowledge ( " Einstein " ) . 	0
WTP	16917	Youre a braver man than I am , Roland , for signing with your name to what you just said . 	0
WTP	16918	I believe that aptitude would go further in real life , this write fest has certainly " evolved " into a one hell of a discussion , 	0
WTP	16919	Catholic Charities is one of the largest charities in the United States , I think it is in the top ten - per a Forbes article referenced on its wikipedia page . 	0
WTP	16920	I would also like to point out that the good things the church does - its current missions , orphanages , schools , universities , Catholic Charities and Catholic Releif Services only get passing mention with no elaboration on the vast number - millions of people helped by the church currently each year . 	0

WTP	16922	While the LGBT population of San Francisco is certainly one of its most internationally recognizable elements , it is one aspect of the many things that are recognizable about San Francisco and should probably be included in the lead , I would prefer that all the items listed there maintain a parallel structure . 	0
WTP	16923	The final paragraph in the lead does not need to have an overly technical representation of the gay and lesbian population of San Francisco . 	1
WTP	16924	The section has been treated no differently than any other paragraph that has contained criticism of the church . 	0
WTP	16925	Entropy1 , don ' t let me discourage you from trying to improve this article , but in this case I think you are trying to introduce conclusions that are not supported by mainstream scholars , including Mormon mainstream historians like Richard Bushman . 	0
WTP	16926	But the proposed material here , such as the newspaper articles , is not appropriate in this article . 	1
WTP	16927	The First Vision is a very important part of post-1900 Mormonism . 	0
WTP	16928	if the tone of my edits was not neutral ( this is how X is called by Y ) , or if my attempt to clarify the reasoning of ( X ) why it / they use this name were offending , then that should be discussed on this page or modified accordingly in the article ! 	0
WTP	16929	but it was removed and the removal reasoning was not clarified here and the discussion was left open because chose not to take part of the discussion ! 	0
WTP	16930	in that sense the article is not balanced , although i would say that as far as i can see , it does not introduce false information , but it defiantly shuts off a whole perspective of it ! 	1
WTP	16931	I agree . 	0
WTP	16932	It requires that all majority - and significant-minority views be presented fairly , in a disinterested tone , and in rough proportion to their prevalence within the source material . " , the last post in the discussion ( before my responses regarding the discussion ) was by Sean . hoyland , i confirmed to the constructive input that shows that no one but i agrees that the term IOF should be used in the intro , it is clear that this term is not welcomed by some editors , and seems offensive to some , never the less , it still represents a major perspective that the article is completely ignoring ! 	0
WTP	16933	regardless whether we agree on it or not ! 	0
WTP	16934	Can you please clarify how i am vandalizing the article ? 	0
WTP	16935	but lets not get drifted off the topic here , i will quote " The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting perspectives on a topic as evidenced by reliable sources . 	0
WTP	16936	Though I deeply respect my former professor Anderson , I don ' t think we can make much use of his BYU Studies article in Wikipedia , given that no non-Mormon scholar agrees with the underlying conclusion of his article . 	1
WTP	16937	frankly I ' m offended by you calling my edits vandalism ! 	0
WTP	16938	but i would rather keep the discussion revolving around the core issue of this discussion . 	0
WTP	16939	Thus , Obama ' s and most other Democrats pages stay clean . 	0
WTP	16940	They simply put you , me or anybody else who tries for a legitimate edit , through what is obviously a run-around , until we give up . 	0
WTP	16941	They are clearly biased . 	0
WTP	16942	Feel free to contact me with any further citation or POV request in this FA attempt . 	0
