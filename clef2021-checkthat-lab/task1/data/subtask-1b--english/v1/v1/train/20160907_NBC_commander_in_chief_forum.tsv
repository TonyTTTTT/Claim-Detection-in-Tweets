1	LAUER	Good evening, everyone, from the Carrier Intrepid here in New York City.	0
2	LAUER	In just a couple of short months, Americans are going to vote in a critical election.	0
3	LAUER	Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vying not only to become president of the United States, but one of them will become the leader of the most potent military force the world has ever seen.	0
4	LAUER	I’m standing in a place where I can actually see the site of the World Trade Center.	0
5	LAUER	Fifteen years ago this week, the worst terror attack on American soil changed the world and launched this nation into years of war.	0
6	LAUER	Tonight’s forum is a great opportunity for these nominees to talk about national security and the complex global issues that face our nation.	0
7	LAUER	And they’ll get to tell you why they are ready for the role of commander-in-chief.	0
8	SYSTEM	(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)	0
9	KENNEDY	It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States.	0
10	JOHNSON	I have today ordered to Vietnam the Air Mobile Division.	0
11	REAGAN	Air and naval forces of the United States launched a series of strikes against the headquarters and military assets that support Moammar Gadhafi.	0
12	GEORGE H.W. BUSH	No president can easily commit our sons and daughters to war.	0
13	BILL CLINTON	We can and will succeed because our mission is clear and our troops are strong.	0
14	GEORGE W. BUSH	I can hear you.	0
15	GEORGE W. BUSH	The rest of the world hears you.	0
16	GEORGE W. BUSH	And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.	0
17	OBAMA	I can report to the American people the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaida.	0

19	ANNOUNCER	The Commander-in-Chief Forum, live from the Carrier Intrepid in New York.	0
20	ANNOUNCER	Here now is Matt Lauer.	0
21	LAUER	Good evening, everyone.	0
22	LAUER	The decisions a commander-in- chief makes can have a profound and lasting impact on all Americans, but none more so than the brave men and women who serve, fight, and die for our country.	0
23	LAUER	What makes tonight’s forum unique, some of the questions will be asked by U.S. military veterans who are in our audience.	0
24	LAUER	The presidential nominees will appear back-to-back tonight.	0
25	LAUER	After a coin toss yesterday won by Mr. Trump, he chose to go second.	0
26	LAUER	So that means we begin tonight with the Democratic nominee for president.	0
27	LAUER	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Hillary Clinton.	0
28	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
29	CLINTON	Matt, how are you?	0
30	CLINTON	Good to see you.	0
31	CLINTON	Thank you.	0
32	CLINTON	Hi.	0
33	CLINTON	How are you?	0
34	LAUER	Good to have you.	0
35	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
36	LAUER	Nice to see you.	0
37	LAUER	Good evening.	0
38	CLINTON	Thank you very much.	0
39	CLINTON	I’m happy you’re doing this.	0
40	LAUER	Let me — thank you very much, I’m happy to be here.	0
41	LAUER	Let me ask you something ahead of time that I’ll ask Mr. Trump in a half an hour.	0
42	LAUER	To the best of your ability tonight, can we talk about your qualities and your qualifications to be commander-in-chief and not use this as an opportunity to attack Mr. Trump, all right?	0
43	LAUER	And I’ll ask him the exact same thing.	0
44	CLINTON	I think that’s an exactly right way to proceed.	0
45	LAUER	OK.	0
46	CLINTON	This is a very important decision for our country.	0
47	CLINTON	And each of us should be presenting our experience, our expertise, and our plans to protect and defend the United States and our allies around the world.	0
48	LAUER	What is the most important characteristic that a commander-in-chief can possess?	0
49	CLINTON	Steadiness.	0
50	CLINTON	An absolute rock steadiness, and mixed with strength to be able to make the hard decisions.	0
51	CLINTON	Because I’ve had the unique experience of watching and working with several presidents.	0
52	CLINTON	And these are not easy decisions.	0
53	CLINTON	If they were, they wouldn’t get to the president in the first place.	0
54	CLINTON	And when you’re sitting in the Situation Room, as I have on numerous occasions, particularly with respect to determining whether to recommend the raid against bin Laden, what you want in a president, a commander-in-chief, is someone who listens, who evaluates what is being told to him or her, who is able to sort out the very difficult options being presented…	0
55	LAUER	You’re talking about judgment.	0
56	CLINTON	… and then makes the decision.	0
57	CLINTON	Makes the decision, that’s right.	0
58	LAUER	So judgment is a key.	0
59	CLINTON	Temperament and judgment, yes.	0
60	LAUER	The word “judgment” has been used a lot around you, Secretary Clinton, over the last year-and-a-half, and in particular concerning your use of your personal e-mail and server to communicate while you were secretary of state.	0
61	LAUER	You’ve said it’s a mistake.	0
62	CLINTON	Mm-hmm.	0
63	LAUER	You said you made not the best choice.	0
64	LAUER	You were communicating on highly sensitive topics.	0
65	LAUER	Why wasn’t it more than a mistake?	0
66	LAUER	Why wasn’t it disqualifying, if you want to be commander-in- chief?	0
67	CLINTON	Well, Matt, first of all, as I have said repeatedly, it was a mistake to have a personal account.	0
68	CLINTON	I would certainly not do it again.	0
69	CLINTON	I make no excuses for it.	0
70	CLINTON	It was something that should not have been done.	0
71	CLINTON	But the real question is the handling of classified material, which is I think what the implication of your question was.	0
72	CLINTON	And for all the viewers watching you tonight, I have a lot of experience dealing with classified material, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee going into the four years as secretary of state.	0
73	CLINTON	Classified material has a header which says “top secret,” “secret,” “confidential.” Nothing — and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice — none of the e-mails sent or received by me had such a header.	1
74	LAUER	Were some of the e-mails sent or received by you referring to our drone program, our covert drone program?	0
75	CLINTON	Yes, because — of course, there were no discussions of any of the covert actions in process being determined about whether or not to go forward.	0
76	CLINTON	But every part of our government had to deal with questions, and the secretary of state’s office was first and foremost.	0
77	CLINTON	So there are ways of talking about the drone program…	0
78	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
79	LAUER	And you said you thought your communications on that were fairly routine?	0
80	CLINTON	Well, let me say, the FBI just released their report about their investigation, they discussed drone matters in the unclassified section of their report.	0
81	LAUER	But Director Comey also said this after reviewing all the information.	0
82	LAUER	He said there is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.	0
83	CLINTON	Well, Matt, I just respectfully point to the hundreds of experienced foreign policy experts, diplomats, defense officials who were communicating information on the unclassified system because it was necessary to answer questions and to be able publicly to go as far as we could, which was not acknowledging the program.	0
84	CLINTON	But I would be in Pakistan, as I was on several occasions.	0
85	CLINTON	There might very well have been a strike.	0
86	CLINTON	I would be asked in a public setting, in an interview, about it.	0
87	CLINTON	It was known to have happened.	0
88	CLINTON	We had to have an answer that did not move into classified area.	0
89	CLINTON	And I think we handled that appropriately.	0
90	LAUER	You mentioned you’re in Pakistan.	0
91	LAUER	Some of the e-mails you sent and received happened while you were overseas.	0
92	LAUER	And Director Comey also said that while they have no proof, we assessed that it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail accounts.	0
93	CLINTON	Matt, there is no evidence.	0
94	CLINTON	Of course anything is possible.	0
95	CLINTON	But what is factual is the State Department system was hacked.	0
96	CLINTON	Most of the government systems are way behind the curve.	0
97	CLINTON	We’ve had hacking repeatedly, even in the White House.	0
98	CLINTON	There is no evidence my system was hacked.	0
99	LAUER	Let us bring in Hallie Jackson of NBC News who’s been covering this campaign.	0
100	LAUER	She’s getting questions from our veterans.	0
101	LAUER	Hallie, who are you with?	0
102	JACKSON	Hi, Matt.	0
103	JACKSON	I’m with Lieutenant Jon Lester (ph), who will stand with me here.	0
104	JACKSON	He began his military career by enlisting in the Air Force and then switched over to the Navy before he retired, where he flew P-3 Orions in Desert Storm and in Desert Shield.	0
105	JACKSON	He’s a Republican, and he has this question for you, Secretary Clinton.	0
106	CLINTON	Thank you.	0
107	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, thank you very much for coming tonight.	0
108	QUESTION	As a naval flight officer, I held a top secret sensitive compartmentalized information clearance.	0
109	QUESTION	And that provided me access to materials and information highly sensitive to our warfighting capabilities.	0
110	QUESTION	Had I communicated this information not following prescribed protocols, I would have been prosecuted and imprisoned.	0
111	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, how can you expect those such as myself who were and are entrusted with America’s most sensitive information to have any confidence in your leadership as president when you clearly corrupted our national security?	0
112	CLINTON	Well, I appreciate your concern and also your experience.	0
113	CLINTON	But let me try to make the distinctions that I think are important for me to answer your question.	0
114	CLINTON	First, as I said to Matt, you know and I know classified material is designated.	0
115	CLINTON	It is marked.	0
116	CLINTON	There is a header so that there is no dispute at all that what is being communicated to or from someone who has that access is marked classified.	0
117	CLINTON	And what we have here is the use of an unclassified system by hundreds of people in our government to send information that was not marked, there were no headers, there was no statement, top secret, secret, or confidential.	0
118	CLINTON	I communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system.	0
119	CLINTON	I took it very seriously.	0
120	CLINTON	When I traveled, I went into one of those little tents that I’m sure you’ve seen around the world because we didn’t want there to be any potential for someone to have embedded a camera to try to see whatever it is that I was seeing that was designated, marked, and headed as classified.	0
121	LAUER	Let us…	0
122	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
123	CLINTON	So I did exactly what I should have done and I take it very seriously, always have, always will.	0
124	LAUER	Sir, thank you.	0
125	LAUER	Thank you very much for your question.	0
126	LAUER	Secretary Clinton, let’s talk about your vote in favor of the war in Iraq.	0
127	LAUER	You’ve since said it was a mistake.	0
128	CLINTON	Mm-hmm.	0
129	LAUER	Obviously, it was not something you said you would do again.	0
130	LAUER	I asked before for people to raise their hand if you served in Iraq.	0
131	LAUER	Can you do it again?	0
132	LAUER	How do you think these people feel when the person running to be their commander-in-chief says her vote to go to war in Iraq was a mistake?	0
133	CLINTON	Look, I think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake.	0
134	CLINTON	And I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective, my mistake.	0
135	CLINTON	I also believe that it is imperative that we learn from the mistakes, like after- action reports are supposed to do, and so we must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again.	0
136	CLINTON	I think I’m in the best possible position to be able to understand that and prevent it.	0
137	CLINTON	But I will say this.	0
138	CLINTON	I’m asking to be judged on the totality of my record, what I’ve done for our veterans as first lady, as senator, what I’ve done for Gold Star Families, working with them to increase the death benefit from $12,000 to $100,000, working with Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, to get TRICARE for our National Guard members who didn’t have health care unless they were deployed, working to provide more support for the care of our veterans, those who are wounded, working with the Fisher family, now into the third generation of caring for our fallen heroes, working with John McCain to raise money for Brooke Medical Center’s Intrepid Center to take care of those who are coming back with profound injuries, working on TBI and PTSD and so much more, working with groups to end veteran suicide, like TAPS.	0
139	CLINTON	So, yes…	0
140	LAUER	I’m going to get on to that subject in a second.	0
141	CLINTON	There was — there was a mistake.	0
142	CLINTON	Now, my opponent was for the war in Iraq.	0
143	CLINTON	He says he wasn’t.	0
144	CLINTON	You can go back and look at the record.	0
145	CLINTON	He supported it.	0
146	CLINTON	He told Howard Stern he supported it.	0
147	CLINTON	So he supported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening, and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.	0
148	CLINTON	I have taken responsibility for my decision.	0
149	LAUER	Let me go to another…	0
150	CLINTON	He refuses to take responsibility for his support.	0
151	CLINTON	That is a judgment issue.	0
152	LAUER	Let me go to another question.	0
153	LAUER	Hallie?	0
154	JACKSON	(OFF-MIKE) who served in the Air Force for nearly a decade, where she was an intelligence specialist, specializing in countering violent extremism.	0
155	JACKSON	Like you, Secretary Clinton, she’s a Democrat and she has this question for you.	0
156	QUESTION	Thank you.	0
157	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, to your point, you have had an extensive record with military intervention.	0
158	QUESTION	How do you respond to progressives like myself who worry and have concerns that your hawkish foreign policy will continue?	0
159	QUESTION	And what is your plan to end wasteful war campaigns in which our peers, servicewomen and men, continue to be killed and wounded?	0
160	CLINTON	Well, I assume you’re talking about Iraq, because of my vote, and you probably are talking about Libya, because of the role that I played in the administration’s decision about whether to take on Gadhafi.	0
161	CLINTON	But before I get to that, let me say very clearly: I view force as a last resort, not a first choice.	0
162	CLINTON	I will do everything in my power to make sure that our men and women in the military are fully prepared for any challenge that they may have to face on our behalf.	0
163	CLINTON	But I will also be as careful as I can in making the most significant decisions any president and commander-in-chief can make about sending our men and women into harm’s way.	0
164	CLINTON	With respect to Libya, again, there’s no difference between my opponent and myself.	0
165	CLINTON	He’s on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population.	1
166	CLINTON	I put together a coalition that included NATO, included the Arab League, and we were able to save lives.	0
167	CLINTON	We did not lose a single American in that action.	0
168	CLINTON	And I think taking that action was the right decision.	0
169	CLINTON	Not taking it, and permitting there to be an ongoing civil war in Libya, would have been as dangerous and threatening as what we are now seeing in Syria.	0
170	LAUER	I’m going to jump in.	0
171	LAUER	Thank you very much for your question.	0
172	LAUER	Let me ask you about the Iran nuclear deal.	0
173	LAUER	It was signed under Secretary Kerry; it was begun under you.	0
174	LAUER	You started those talks.	0
175	CLINTON	Right, I did.	0
176	LAUER	You have said you expect the Iranians to cheat, you think they’ll buy time, and perhaps stay along their course to building a nuclear weapon.	0
177	LAUER	If they cheat, Secretary Clinton, will you have any course of action other than a military course of action?	0
178	LAUER	Would you enter into negotiations with again (ph)?	0
179	LAUER	Would you go back to economic sanctions knowing they cheated and are then closer to a nuclear weapon?	0
180	CLINTON	Matt, look, let me put this in context, because this is one of the most important strategic questions we face.	0
181	CLINTON	When I became secretary of state, the Iranians were on a fast track to acquiring the material necessary to get a nuclear weapon.	0
182	CLINTON	That had happened the prior eight years.	0
183	CLINTON	They mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, they built covert facilities, they stocked them with centrifuges, and they were moving forward.	0
184	CLINTON	What was our decision?	0
185	CLINTON	Our decision was to try to put together an international coalition that included Russia and China to exert the kind of pressure through sanctions that the United States alone could not do.	0
186	LAUER	Right, but you’ve said that you think they’re going to cheat…	0
187	CLINTON	Now, wait, let me — look, this is an important issue.	0
188	CLINTON	I know we’re on TV and we don’t have a lot of time.	0
189	LAUER	I want to get to a lot of questions.	0
190	CLINTON	I will talk quickly.	0
191	CLINTON	But I want people to understand this.	0
192	CLINTON	So, yes, I put together the coalition.	0
193	CLINTON	We imposed the sanctions.	0
194	CLINTON	We got them to the negotiating table.	0
195	CLINTON	And after I left, we got the agreement.	0
196	CLINTON	That agreement put a lid on their nuclear weapons program and imposed intrusive inspections.	0
197	CLINTON	I have said we are going to enforce it to the letter.	0
198	LAUER	Do you think they’re playing us?	0
199	CLINTON	On the nuclear issue, no.	0
200	CLINTON	I think we have enough insight into what they’re doing to be able to say we have to distrust but verify.	0
201	CLINTON	What I am focused on is all the other malicious activities of the Iranians — ballistic missiles, support for terrorists, being involved in Syria, Yemen, and other places, supporting Hezbollah, Hamas.	0
202	CLINTON	But here’s the difference, Matt.	0
203	CLINTON	I would rather as president be dealing with Iran on all of those issues without having to worry as much about their racing for a nuclear weapon.	0
204	CLINTON	So we have made the world safer; we just have to make sure it’s enforced.	0
205	LAUER	Hallie?	0
206	JACKSON	I’m with Kenneth Anderson (ph).	0
207	JACKSON	He’s one of our undecided voters here.	0
208	JACKSON	He considers himself an independent.	0
209	JACKSON	He earned the rank of sergeant in the Marine Corps, where he was an Arabic translator during three tours in Iraq.	0
210	JACKSON	Kenneth, you have a question for Secretary Clinton.	0
211	QUESTION	Yes, Secretary Clinton, last October you said that surveys of veterans show that they’re overall satisfied with their treatment and that the problems with the V.A.	0
212	QUESTION	aren’t as widespread as they’re made out to be.	0
213	QUESTION	So do you think the problems with the V.A.	0
214	QUESTION	have been made to seem worse than they really are?	0
215	CLINTON	Look, I was outraged by the stories that came out about the V.A.	0
216	CLINTON	And I have been very clear about the necessity for doing whatever is required to move the V.A.	0
217	CLINTON	into the 21st century, to provide the kind of treatment options that our veterans today desperately need and deserve.	0
218	CLINTON	And that’s what I will do as president.	0
219	CLINTON	But I will not let the V.A.	0
220	CLINTON	be privatized.	0
221	CLINTON	And I do think there is an agenda out there, supported by my opponent, to do just that.	1
222	CLINTON	I think that would be very disastrous for our military veterans.	0
223	CLINTON	So I’m going to do everything I can — I’m going to have a meeting every week in the Oval Office.	0
224	CLINTON	We’re going to bring the V.A.	0
225	CLINTON	people, we’re going to bring the DOD people, because we’ve got to have a better fit between getting mustered out and getting into the V.A.	0
226	CLINTON	system, sometimes — and you probably know this, Sergeant — I’ve met so many vets who get mustered out, who leave the service, they can’t find their records from DOD, and those records never make it to the V.A.	0
227	CLINTON	They feel like they’re living in a funhouse.	0
228	CLINTON	They have to go over the same things over and over.	0
229	CLINTON	We’re living in a technological world.	0
230	CLINTON	You cannot tell me we can’t do a better job getting that information.	0
231	CLINTON	And so I’m going to focus on this.	0
232	CLINTON	I’m going to work with everybody.	0
233	CLINTON	I’m going to make them work together.	0
234	LAUER	And I’m going to jump in.	0
235	CLINTON	And we’re going to fix the problems in the V.A.	0
236	LAUER	Sergeant, thank you very much for your question.	0
237	LAUER	Let’s talk about veterans and suicide.	0
238	CLINTON	Yes, let’s, please.	0
239	LAUER	It’s an alarming, alarming story.	0
240	LAUER	The population of veterans has a rate of suicide far above the general population.	1
241	CLINTON	Twenty — twenty suicides a day.	1
242	LAUER	What are you going to do to stop it?	0
243	CLINTON	Well, this month is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month.	0
244	CLINTON	And I’ve spent a lot of time with family members, survivors, who’ve lost a loved one after he or she came home, sometimes suffering from PTSD or TBI or sexual assault, being handed bags of opioids, not being given an appropriate treatment to help that particular person, which is something, to go back to the sergeant’s question, we have to change.	0
245	CLINTON	So I rolled out my mental health agenda last week, and I have a whole section devoted to veterans’ mental health.	0
246	CLINTON	And we’ve got to remove the stigma.	0
247	CLINTON	We’ve got to help people currently serving not to feel that if they report their sense of unease, their depression, that somehow it’s going to be a mark against them.	0
248	CLINTON	We have to do more about addiction, not only drugs, but also alcohol.	0
249	CLINTON	So I have put forth a really robust agenda, working with a lot of the VSOs and other groups, like TAPS, who have been thinking about this and trying to figure out what we’re going to do to help our veterans re-enter civilian life and live full, productive lives.	0
250	LAUER	Hallie?	0
251	JACKSON	I’m with Ernie Young.	0
252	JACKSON	Come on up here with me, a former Army captain, who led troops during tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan.	0
253	JACKSON	He’s an independent voter.	0
254	JACKSON	And you have a question for the secretary.	0
255	QUESTION	Secretary Clinton, as an Army veteran, a commander-in- chief’s to empathize with servicemembers and their families is important to me.	0
256	QUESTION	The ability to truly understand implications and consequences of your decisions, actions, or inactions.	0
257	QUESTION	How will you determine when and where to deploy troops directly into harm’s way, especially to combat ISIS?	0
258	LAUER	As briefly as you can.	0
259	CLINTON	We have to defeat ISIS.	0
260	CLINTON	That is my highest counterterrorism goal.	0
261	CLINTON	And we’ve got to do it with air power.	0
262	CLINTON	We’ve got to do it with much more support for the Arabs and the Kurds who will fight on the ground against ISIS.	0
263	CLINTON	We have to squeeze them by continuing to support the Iraqi military.	0
264	CLINTON	They’ve taken back Ramadi, Fallujah.	0
265	CLINTON	They’ve got to hold them.	0
266	CLINTON	They’ve got to now get into Mosul.	0
267	CLINTON	We’re going to work to make sure that they have the support — they have special forces, as you know, they have enablers, they have surveillance, intelligence, reconnaissance help.	0
268	CLINTON	They are not going to get ground troops.	0
269	CLINTON	We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again.	0
270	CLINTON	And we’re not putting ground troops into Syria.	0
271	CLINTON	We’re going to defeat ISIS without committing American ground troops.	0
272	CLINTON	So those are the kinds of decisions we have to make on a case-by-case basis.	0
273	CLINTON	And, remember, when I became secretary of state, we had 200,000 troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.	0
274	CLINTON	And I’m very grateful that we have brought home the vast majority of those.	0
275	CLINTON	We have a residual force, as you know, in Afghanistan.	0
276	CLINTON	We have built up several thousands of the folks that I’ve talked about who are assisting in the fight against ISIS.	0
277	CLINTON	But it is in our national security interest to defeat ISIS.	0
278	CLINTON	And I intend to make that happen.	0
279	LAUER	Thank you very much for your question.	0
280	CLINTON	And as part of it, we’re going after Baghdadi, the leader, because it will help us focus our attention, just like going after bin Laden helped us focus our attention…	0
281	LAUER	Secretary…	0
282	CLINTON	… in the fight against Al Qaida in the Afghanistan- Pakistan theater.	0
283	LAUER	Secretary Clinton, I am fast running out of time.	0
284	LAUER	I want to get to one of the concerns just about everybody in this country, and that is terror attacks on our soil.	0
285	CLINTON	Right.	0
286	LAUER	Either directed by ISIS or inspired by ISIS.	0
287	LAUER	Would your message as the next president of the United States or potential next president be to Americans that we simply are living in the reality that those attacks will happen?	0
288	LAUER	And can you guarantee people that after four years of a Clinton presidency, they will be safer on the streets of San Bernardino or Boston than they are today?	0
289	CLINTON	Well, Matt, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that that’s the result.	0
290	CLINTON	I’m not going to, you know, promise something that I think most thinking Americans know is going to be a huge challenge, and here’s why.	0
291	CLINTON	We’ve got to have an intelligence surge.	0
292	CLINTON	We’ve got to get a lot more cooperation out of Europe, out of the Middle East.	0
293	CLINTON	We have to do a better job of not only collecting and analyzing the intelligence we do have, but distributing it much more quickly down the ladder to state and local law enforcement.	0
294	CLINTON	We also have to do a better job combating ISIS online, where they recruit, where they radicalize.	0
295	CLINTON	And I don’t think we’re doing as much as we can.	0
296	CLINTON	We need to work with Silicon Valley.	0
297	CLINTON	We need to work with our experts in our government.	0
298	CLINTON	We have got to disrupt, we have got to take them on in the arena of ideas that, unfortunately, pollute and capture the minds of vulnerable people.	0
299	CLINTON	So we need to wage this war against ISIS from the air, on the ground, and online, in cyberspace.	0
300	CLINTON	And here at home, for goodness’s sakes, we have to finally pass a law prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in the United States of America.	0
301	CLINTON	So we’ve got work to do.	0
302	CLINTON	I know we can do that work.	0
303	CLINTON	I’m meeting with a group of terror experts, counterterrorism experts.	0
304	CLINTON	But I want to just say one additional thing.	0
305	LAUER	I’ve got 30 seconds left.	0
306	CLINTON	Matt Olsen, the former director of the National Center on Counterterrorism, has a great article out today saying the last thing we need to do is to play into the hands of ISIS.	0
307	CLINTON	Going after American Muslims, defaming a Gold Star family, the family of Captain Khan, making it more difficult for us to have a coalition with Muslim majority nations…	0
308	LAUER	And we tried to have an agreement…	0
309	CLINTON	… that is not going to help us to succeed in defeating ISIS and protecting our American homeland.	0
310	LAUER	Secretary Hillary Clinton, thank you very much.	0
311	CLINTON	Thank you.	0
312	CLINTON	Thank you all.	0
313	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
314	CLINTON	Thank you so much.	0
315	CLINTON	Too short a time.	0
316	LAUER	I know.	0
317	LAUER	We’re going to take a break.	0
318	LAUER	We’re going to have much more with her competitor, Donald Trump, right after this.	0
319	LAUER	You’re watching NBC News special, the Commander-in-Chief Forum.	0
320	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
321	LAUER	We welcome you back now to this NBC News special, the Commander-in-Chief Forum.	0
322	LAUER	Tonight we’re speaking with the two major party presidential nominees to find out where they stand on the critical issues.	0
323	LAUER	Now, please welcome the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump.	0
324	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
325	LAUER	Good to see you.	0
326	TRUMP	Thank you, Matt.	0
327	LAUER	Thank you very much for joining us.	0
328	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
329	LAUER	You heard me say to Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and it didn’t completely work out toward the end there, as much as possible I’d like you to tell our veterans and our people at home why you are prepared for the role of commander-in-chief and try to keep the attacks to a minimum.	0
330	LAUER	We’ve had a year of that and maybe 60 more days of it.	0
331	TRUMP	To a minimum, absolutely.	0
332	LAUER	OK, perfect.	0
333	LAUER	To a minimum.	0
334	LAUER	I guess that’s a question of definition.	0
335	TRUMP	I guess.	0
336	LAUER	Any time you interview a president, sitting or past president, they will tell you that the most daunting…	0
337	TRUMP	Was I supposed to answer this question?	0
338	LAUER	No, no, no, I mean just keep the attacks to a minimum.	0
339	LAUER	Any time you talk to a president, they’ll tell you the most daunting part of the job is the role of commander-in-chief.	0
340	TRUMP	Right.	0
341	LAUER	What have you experienced in your personal life or your professional life that you believe prepares you to make the decisions that a commander-in-chief has to make?	0
342	TRUMP	Well, I’ve built a great company.	0
343	TRUMP	I’ve been all over the world.	0
344	TRUMP	I’ve dealt with foreign countries.	0
345	TRUMP	I’ve done very well, as an example, tremendously well dealing with China and dealing with so many of the countries that are just ripping this country.	0
346	TRUMP	They are just taking advantage of us like nobody’s ever seen before.	0
347	TRUMP	And I’ve had great experience dealing on an international basis.	0
348	TRUMP	I look today and I see Russian planes circling our planes.	0
349	TRUMP	They’re taunting us.	0
350	TRUMP	I see in Iran, I see the boats taunting our ships, our destroyers, and I think…	0
351	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
352	LAUER	But what have you done in your life that prepares you to send men and women of the United States into harm’s way?	0
353	TRUMP	Well, I think the main thing is I have great judgment.	0
354	TRUMP	I have good judgment.	0
355	TRUMP	I know what’s going on.	0
356	TRUMP	I’ve called so many of the shots.	0
357	TRUMP	And I happened to hear Hillary Clinton say that I was not against the war in Iraq.	0
358	TRUMP	I was totally against the war in Iraq.	1
359	TRUMP	From a — you can look at Esquire magazine from ’04.	0
360	TRUMP	You can look at before that.	0
361	TRUMP	And I was against the war in Iraq because I said it’s going to totally destabilize the Middle East, which it has.	0
362	TRUMP	It has absolutely been a disastrous war, and by the way, perhaps almost as bad was the way Barack Obama got out.	0
363	TRUMP	That was a disaster.	0
364	LAUER	People talk about you and commander-in-chief, and not just Secretary Clinton, but some of your Republican opponents in the primary season, and they wonder about your temperament.	0
365	LAUER	They say, does Donald Trump have the temperament to be commander-in-chief?	0
366	LAUER	You said something recently that I found interesting.	0
367	LAUER	You admitted that sometimes in the heat of a debate or when you’re talking about a lot of issues you say things that you later regret.	0
368	LAUER	So can we afford that with a commander-in-chief — to have a commander-in-chief who says things that he later regrets?	0
369	TRUMP	Well, when you say regret, yeah, sure, I regret.	0
370	TRUMP	But in the meantime, I beat 16 people and here I am.	0
371	TRUMP	So, you know, to a certain extent there is a regret.	0
372	TRUMP	I would have liked to have done it in a nicer manner.	0
373	TRUMP	But I had 16 very talented people that I had to go through.	0
374	TRUMP	And that was a lot of people.	0
375	LAUER	But when you say…	0
376	TRUMP	That was a record, Matt.	0
377	TRUMP	That was a record in the history of Republican politics.	0
378	TRUMP	I was able to get more votes than anybody ever has gotten in the history of Republican politics.	1
379	LAUER	But when you say inflammatory things… (CROSSTALK)	0
380	LAUER	… in a presidential campaign, it’s different than saying them when you’re commander-in-chief.	0
381	LAUER	If you say things you regret…	0
382	TRUMP	I agree with you.	0
383	LAUER	… when you’re commander-in-chief, you can spark a conflict, you can destabilize a region, you can put American lives at risk.	0
384	LAUER	Can we afford to take that risk with you?	0
385	TRUMP	Well, I think absolutely.	0
386	TRUMP	I think if you saw what happened in Mexico the other day, where I went there, I had great relationships, everything else.	0
387	TRUMP	I let them know where the United States stands.	0
388	TRUMP	I mean, we’ve been badly hurt by Mexico, both on the border and with taking all of our jobs or a big percentage of our jobs.	0
389	TRUMP	And if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government.	0
390	TRUMP	That’s how well we did.	0
391	LAUER	Back in August…	0
392	TRUMP	And that’s how well we’re going to have to do, Matt.	0
393	LAUER	Back in August, when you admitted that you regret some of the things you said, you also said this.	0
394	LAUER	“I can promise you this: I will always tell you the truth.”	0
395	TRUMP	It’s true.	0
396	LAUER	So let me read some of the things you’ve said.	0
397	LAUER	“I know more about ISIS than the generals do.	0
398	LAUER	Believe me.” Was that the truth?	0
399	TRUMP	Well, the generals under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have not been successful.	0
400	TRUMP	ISIS…	0
401	LAUER	Do you know more about ISIS than they do?	0
402	TRUMP	I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble.	0
403	TRUMP	They have been reduced to a point where it’s embarrassing for our country.	0
404	TRUMP	You have a force of 30,000 or so people.	0
405	TRUMP	Nobody really knows.	0
406	TRUMP	But probably 30,000 people.	0
407	TRUMP	And I can just see the great — as an example- General George Patton spinning in his grave as ISIS we can’t beat.	0
408	TRUMP	We had the greatest…	0
409	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
410	LAUER	Yeah, you’ve said if we had MacArthur today or if we had Patton today, we would not have ISIS, that the rise of these military commanders that we have today, they come up the chain of command, and by the time they get to the top, they’re too politically correct.	0
411	LAUER	And we know that’s not a compliment coming from you.	0
412	LAUER	Have you lost faith in the military commanders?	0
413	TRUMP	I have great faith in the military.	0
414	TRUMP	I have great faith in certain of the commanders, certainly.	0
415	TRUMP	But I have no faith in Hillary Clinton or the leadership.	0
416	TRUMP	You look at what’s happened.	0
417	TRUMP	And, you know, when she comes in and starts saying, oh, I would have done this, I would have — she’s been there for 30 years.	0
418	TRUMP	I mean, we need change, Matt.	0
419	TRUMP	We have to have it, and we have to have it fast.	0
420	LAUER	Let’s go to Hallie Jackson in our crowd.	0
421	LAUER	Hallie?	0
422	JACKSON	I’m with Phillip Clay (ph), who was a public affairs officer in the Marine Corps.	0
423	JACKSON	He spent a year in Anbar province in Iraq.	0
424	JACKSON	He left the military with the rank of captain, service that inspired him to write a book.	0
425	JACKSON	He’s a Democrat, and he has this question for you, Mr. Trump.	0
426	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, over the past 15 years, a lot of U.S. troops have bled and died securing towns and provinces from Iraq to Afghanistan, only to have insurgent groups like ISIS spring back the moment we leave.	0
427	QUESTION	Now, you’ve claimed to have a secret plan to defeat ISIS.	0
428	QUESTION	But you’re hardly the first politician to promise a quick victory and a speedy homecoming.	0
429	QUESTION	So assuming we do defeat ISIS, what next?	0
430	QUESTION	What is your plan for the region to ensure that a group like them doesn’t just come back?	0
431	TRUMP	Sure.	0
432	TRUMP	I mean, part of the problem that we’ve had is we go in, we defeat somebody, and then we don’t know what we’re doing after that.	0
433	TRUMP	We lose it, like as an example, you look at Iraq, what happened, how badly that was handled.	0
434	TRUMP	And then when President Obama took over, likewise, it was a disaster.	0
435	TRUMP	It was actually somewhat stable.	0
436	TRUMP	I don’t think could ever be very stable to where we should have never gone into in the first place.	0
437	TRUMP	But he came in.	0
438	TRUMP	He said when we go out — and he took everybody out.	0
439	TRUMP	And really, ISIS was formed.	1
440	TRUMP	This was a terrible decision.	0
441	TRUMP	And frankly, we never even got a shot.	0
442	TRUMP	And if you really look at the aftermath of Iraq, Iran is going to be taking over Iraq.	0
443	TRUMP	They’ve been doing it.	0
444	TRUMP	And it’s not a pretty picture.	0
445	TRUMP	The — and I think you know — because you’ve been watching me I think for a long time — I’ve always said, shouldn’t be there, but if we’re going to get out, take the oil.	0
446	TRUMP	If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn’t have ISIS, because ISIS formed with the power and the wealth of that oil.	0
447	LAUER	How were we going to take the oil?	0
448	LAUER	How were we going to do that?	0
449	TRUMP	Just we would leave a certain group behind and you would take various sections where they have the oil.	0
450	TRUMP	They have — people don’t know this about Iraq, but they have among the largest oil reserves in the world, in the entire world.	0
451	TRUMP	And we’re the only ones, we go in, we spend $3 trillion, we lose thousands and thousands of lives, and then, Matt, what happens is, we get nothing.	0
452	TRUMP	You know, it used to be to the victor belong the spoils.	0
453	TRUMP	Now, there was no victor there, believe me.	0
454	TRUMP	There was no victor.	0
455	TRUMP	But I always said: Take the oil.	0
456	TRUMP	One of the benefits we would have had if we took the oil is ISIS would not have been able to take oil and use that oil…	0
457	LAUER	Let me stay on ISIS…	0
458	TRUMP	… to fuel themselves.	0
459	LAUER	Let me stay on ISIS.	0
460	LAUER	When we’ve met in the past and we’ve talked, you say things like I’m going to bomb the expletive out of them very quickly.	0
461	LAUER	And when people like me press you for details like that gentleman just said on what your plan is, you very often say, I’m not going to give you the details because I want to be unpredictable.	0
462	TRUMP	Absolutely.	0
463	TRUMP	The word is unpredictable.	0
464	LAUER	But yesterday, you actually told us a little bit about your plan in your speech.	0
465	LAUER	You said this.	0
466	LAUER	Quote, “We’re going to convene my top generals and they will have 30 days to submit a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS.” So is the plan you’ve been hiding this whole time asking someone else for their plan?	0
467	TRUMP	No.	0
468	TRUMP	But when I do come up with a plan that I like and that perhaps agrees with mine, or maybe doesn’t — I may love what the generals come back with.	0
469	TRUMP	I will convene…	0
470	LAUER	But you have your own plan?	0
471	TRUMP	I have a plan.	0
472	TRUMP	But I want to be — I don’t want to — look.	0
473	TRUMP	I have a very substantial chance of winning.	0
474	TRUMP	Make America great again.	0
475	TRUMP	We’re going to make America great again.	0
476	TRUMP	I have a substantial chance of winning.	0
477	TRUMP	If I win, I don’t want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is.	0
478	LAUER	But you’re going to…	0
479	TRUMP	And let me tell you, if I like maybe a combination of my plan and the generals’ plan, or the generals’ plan, if I like their plan, Matt, I’m not going to call you up and say, “Matt, we have a great plan.” This is what Obama does.	0
480	TRUMP	“We’re going to leave Iraq on a certain day.”	0
481	LAUER	But you’re going to convene a panel of generals, and you’ve already said you know more about ISIS than those generals do.	0
482	TRUMP	Well, they’ll probably be different generals, to be honest with you.	0
483	TRUMP	I mean, I’m looking at the generals, today, you probably saw, I have a piece of paper here, I could show it, 88 generals and admirals endorsed me today.	0
484	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
485	LAUER	It’s a numbers game.	0
486	LAUER	Hillary Clinton claims more numbers.	0
487	TRUMP	Well, it’s not really — it’s not — yeah, numbers.	0
488	TRUMP	People that have been losing for us for a long period of time.	0
489	TRUMP	I mean, the fact is, we have had the worst and you could even say the dumbest foreign policy.	0
490	TRUMP	Our results are so bad.	0
491	TRUMP	We would have been better off had we never, ever spent $2 in that part of the world.	0
492	LAUER	You recently — you recently received two intelligence briefings.	0
493	TRUMP	Yes, I did.	0
494	LAUER	Did anything in that briefing, without going into specifics, shock or alarm you?	0
495	TRUMP	Yes.	0
496	TRUMP	Very much so.	0
497	LAUER	Did you learn new things in that briefing?	0
498	TRUMP	First of all, I have great respect for the people that gave us the briefings.	0
499	TRUMP	We — they were terrific people.	0
500	TRUMP	They were experts on Iraq and Iran and different parts of — and Russia.	0
501	TRUMP	But, yes, there was one thing that shocked me.	0
502	TRUMP	And it just seems to me that what they said President Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who is another total disaster, did exactly the opposite.	0
503	LAUER	Did you learn anything in that briefing — again, not going into specifics — that makes you reconsider some of the things you say you can accomplish, like defeating ISIS quickly?	0
504	TRUMP	No, I didn’t learn anything from that standpoint.	0
505	TRUMP	What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts and our truly — when they call it intelligence, it’s there for a reason — what our experts said to do.	0
506	LAUER	Hallie?	0
507	TRUMP	And I was very, very surprised.	0
508	TRUMP	In almost every instance.	0
509	TRUMP	And I could tell you.	0
510	TRUMP	I have pretty good with the body language.	0
511	TRUMP	I could tell they were not happy.	0
512	TRUMP	Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending.	0
513	LAUER	Hallie?	0
514	JACKSON	I’m with former Army Captain Sue Fulton, who was a member of the First West Point class to include women.	0
515	JACKSON	She served as a signal corps officer in Germany.	0
516	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
517	JACKSON	She’s a Democrat, and she has this question for you, Mr. Trump.	0
518	QUESTION	Mr. Trump.	0
519	TRUMP	Hi, thank you very much.	0
520	QUESTION	Thank you.	0
521	QUESTION	Do you believe that an undocumented person who serves — who wants to serve in the U.S. armed forces deserves to stay in this country legally?	0
522	TRUMP	I think that when you serve in the armed forces, that’s a very special situation, and I could see myself working that out, absolutely.	0
523	LAUER	So she’s saying has already served in the armed forces or wants to serve, plans to serve?	0
524	QUESTION	Plans to serve.	0
525	QUESTION	Plans to serve in the armed forces.	0
526	QUESTION	As you know, under DACA, we already have people who are undocumented who are serving.	0
527	TRUMP	I think military is a very special thing.	0
528	TRUMP	If they plan on serving, if they get in, I would absolutely hold those people — now, we have to be very careful.	0
529	TRUMP	We have to vet very carefully.	0
530	TRUMP	Everybody would agree with that.	0
531	TRUMP	But the answer is, it would be a very special circumstance, yes.	0
532	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
533	LAUER	Thank you very much for your question.	0
534	LAUER	Hallie, you have another one?	0
535	JACKSON	I do.	0
536	JACKSON	Alex Gronkowski (ph) was an Army staff sergeant assigned in special operations.	0
537	JACKSON	He was stationed at Fort Bragg and was deployed to Afghanistan and other places across the Middle East.	0
538	JACKSON	He has not decided who he will vote for yet in November.	0
539	JACKSON	And you have a question for Mr. Trump.	0
540	QUESTION	I do.	0
541	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, as you know, tensions between the United States and Russia have been at the highest level since the Cold War.	0
542	QUESTION	In your first 120 days of presidency, how would you de-escalate the tensions?	0
543	QUESTION	And more importantly, what steps would you take to bring Mr. Putin and the Russian government back to negotiating table?	0
544	TRUMP	I think I would have a very good relationship with many foreign leaders.	0
545	TRUMP	I think it’s very sad, when you look at Barack Obama, as an example, lands Air Force One in China, and they don’t want to put out stairs to get off the plane.	1
546	TRUMP	And he has to use the stairs that mechanics use to get up and down to fix the plane.	0
547	TRUMP	They wouldn’t give him stairs.	0
548	TRUMP	I think it’s very sad, when he lands in Saudi Arabia, and he lands in Cuba, and there aren’t high officials to even greet him.	0
549	TRUMP	This is the first time in the history — the storied history of Air Force One.	0
550	TRUMP	I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin.	0
551	TRUMP	And I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia.	0
552	TRUMP	As I said, take a look today.	0
553	TRUMP	Take a look at what happened with their fighter jets circling one of our aircraft in a very dangerous manner.	0
554	TRUMP	Somebody said less than 10 feet away.	0
555	TRUMP	This is hostility.	0
556	TRUMP	And I saw, just two or three days ago, they looked like they were not exactly getting along, but I looked at President Obama and Putin staring at each other.	0
557	TRUMP	These were not two people that were getting along.	0
558	TRUMP	And, you know, the beautiful part of getting along, Russia wants to defeat ISIS as badly as we do.	0
559	TRUMP	If we had a relationship with Russia, wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could work on it together and knock the hell out of ISIS?	0
560	TRUMP	Wouldn’t that be a wonderful thing?	0
561	LAUER	Let me ask you about some of the things you’ve said about Vladimir Putin.	0
562	LAUER	You said, I will tell you, in terms of leadership, he’s getting an A, our president is not doing so well.	0
563	LAUER	And when referring to a comment that Putin made about you, I think he called you a brilliant leader, you said it’s always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond.	0
564	TRUMP	Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating, according to the different pollsters, who, by the way, some of them are based right here.	1
565	TRUMP	Look, look…	0
566	LAUER	He’s also a guy who annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine, supports Assad in Syria, supports Iran, is trying to undermine our influence in key regions of the world, and according to our intelligence community, probably is the main suspect for the hacking of the DNC computers…	0
567	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
568	TRUMP	Well, nobody knows that for a fact.	0
569	TRUMP	But do you want me to start naming some of the things that President Obama does at the same time?	0
570	LAUER	But do you want to be complimented by that former KGB officer?	0
571	TRUMP	Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, I’ll take the compliment, OK?	1
572	TRUMP	The fact is, look, it’s not going to get him anywhere.	0
573	TRUMP	I’m a negotiator.	0
574	TRUMP	We’re going to take back our country.	0
575	TRUMP	You look at what’s happening to our country, you look at the depleted military.	0
576	TRUMP	You look at the fact that we’ve lost our jobs.	0
577	TRUMP	We’re losing our jobs like we’re a bunch of babies.	0
578	TRUMP	We’re going to take back our country, Matt.	0
579	TRUMP	The fact that he calls me brilliant or whatever he calls me is going to have zero impact.	0
580	LAUER	But the fact that you say you can get along with him, do you think the day…	0
581	TRUMP	I think I’d be able to get along with him.	0
582	LAUER	Do you think the day that you become president of the United States, he’s going to change his mind on some of these key issues?	0
583	TRUMP	Possibly.	0
584	TRUMP	It’s possible.	0
585	TRUMP	I don’t know, Matt.	0
586	TRUMP	It’s possible.	0
587	TRUMP	And it’s not going to have any impact.	0
588	TRUMP	If he says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him.	0
589	TRUMP	I’ve already said, he is really very much of a leader.	0
590	TRUMP	I mean, you can say, oh, isn’t that a terrible thing — the man has very strong control over a country.	0
591	TRUMP	Now, it’s a very different system, and I don’t happen to like the system.	0
592	TRUMP	But certainly, in that system, he’s been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.	0
593	TRUMP	We have a divided country.	0
594	TRUMP	We have a country where you have Hillary Clinton with her e-mails that nobody’s ever seen where she deletes 33,000 e-mails, and that’s after getting a subpoena from Congress.	0
595	TRUMP	If you do that in private business, you get thrown in jail.	0
596	LAUER	Hallie?	0
597	JACKSON	Steve Korea (ph), here with me, was in the Army Reserves and spent 10 months in Iraq right at the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom.	0
598	JACKSON	He is a Republican and has this question for you.	0
599	QUESTION	Good evening, Mr. Trump.	0
600	TRUMP	Hi.	0
601	QUESTION	I like what you say about supporting veterans and how they’re important.	0
602	QUESTION	But I haven’t heard what the actual plans are to continue that support beyond words.	0
603	QUESTION	How do you translate those words to action after you take office?	0
604	TRUMP	Well, I love that question, because I’ve been very close to the vets.	0
605	TRUMP	You see the relationship I have with the vets just by looking at the polls.	0
606	TRUMP	In fact, today a poll came out.	0
607	TRUMP	And my relationship has been very good.	0
608	TRUMP	I have a very, very powerful plan that’s on my website that you possibly saw.	0
609	TRUMP	One of the big problems is the wait time.	0
610	TRUMP	Vets are waiting six days, seven days, eight days.	0
611	TRUMP	And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated essentially just fine, there’s no real problem, it’s over-exaggerated.	1
612	TRUMP	She did say that.	0
613	LAUER	No, no, she went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the V.A.	0
614	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
615	TRUMP	Look, I mean, she made up half of the things she said about me.	0
616	TRUMP	I’m telling you, this is — she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.	0
617	TRUMP	Now, under my plan, if you’ve got to wait — and, by the way, people are dying on line.	0
618	TRUMP	They’re dying, waiting, waiting to get to see a doctor.	0
619	TRUMP	They’re waiting five days and six days.	0
620	TRUMP	Under a part of my plan, if they have that long wait, they walk outside, they go to the local doctor, they choose the doctor, they choose the hospital, whether it’s public or private, they get themselves better.	0
621	TRUMP	In many cases, it’s a minor procedure or a pill or just a prescription.	0
622	TRUMP	And they end up dying because they can’t get to see the doctor.	0
623	TRUMP	We will pay the bill.	0
624	TRUMP	They go outside, they get a doctor, they get a prescription, they do what they have to do, and we pay the bill.	0
625	TRUMP	That is something that I have been praised — and, by the way, I never said take the V.A.	0
626	TRUMP	— take the Veterans Administration private.	0
627	TRUMP	I wouldn’t do that.	0
628	TRUMP	Too much respect for our people.	0
629	TRUMP	I would never do that.	0
630	LAUER	OK.	0
631	TRUMP	I heard it was said that I said that.	0
632	TRUMP	I would not do that.	0
633	TRUMP	But I do believe — I do believe, when you’re waiting in line for six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that.	0
634	TRUMP	You go out, you see the doctor, you get yourself taken care of.	0
635	LAUER	Hallie, you’ve got another question.	0
636	JACKSON	I do.	0
637	JACKSON	Rachel Fredericks (ph), who specialized in aviations operations in the Marine Corps, serving stateside, she lost two friends to suicide.	0
638	JACKSON	And you now struggle yourself with PTSD.	0
639	JACKSON	She’s a Republican, but leaning towards you, still undecided a little bit.	0
640	JACKSON	Rachel, you have a question for Mr. Trump.	0
641	QUESTION	I do.	0
642	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, I wanted to ask what your plan will be to stop 20 veterans a day from killing themselves.	0
643	TRUMP	And actually it’s 22.	0
644	TRUMP	And it’s almost impossible to conceive that this is happening in our country, 20 to 22 people a day are killing themselves.	0
645	TRUMP	A lot of it is they’re killing themselves over the fact that they can’t — they’re under tremendous pain and they can’t see a doctor.	0
646	TRUMP	We’re going to speed up the process.	0
647	TRUMP	We’re going to create a great mental health division.	0
648	TRUMP	They need help.	0
649	TRUMP	They need help.	0
650	TRUMP	They need tremendous help.	0
651	TRUMP	And we’re doing nothing for them.	0
652	TRUMP	The V.A.	0
653	TRUMP	is really almost, you could say, a corrupt enterprise.	0
654	TRUMP	If you look at what’s going on, as an example, Matt, in Arizona, where they caught people stealing, and they can’t even do anything about it, they can’t even fire the people.	0
655	TRUMP	So we are going to make it efficient and good.	0
656	TRUMP	And if it’s not good, you’re going out to private hospitals, public hospitals, and doctors.	0
657	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
658	LAUER	Hallie, one more?	0
659	JACKSON	Donald Day (ph) here, who served as a radio operator in the Marine Corps in the Vietnam era.	0
660	JACKSON	He had tours of duty in Southeast Asia and in Europe.	0
661	JACKSON	He’s also a Democrat and has this question for you.	0
662	QUESTION	Mr. Trump, I have a daughter who is interested in joining the service, but when she researched the military, she saw the stats on sexual assault and decided not to go.	0
663	QUESTION	I have a concern about the rape of women in our armed forces.	0
664	QUESTION	As president, what specifically would you do to support all victims of sexual assault in the military?	0
665	TRUMP	It’s a great question.	0
666	TRUMP	And it’s a massive problem.	0
667	TRUMP	The numbers are staggering, hard to believe, even.	0
668	TRUMP	But we’re going to have to run it very tight.	0
669	TRUMP	I at the same time want to keep the court system within the military.	0
670	TRUMP	I don’t think it should be outside of the military.	0
671	TRUMP	But we have to come down very, very hard on that.	0
672	TRUMP	And your daughter is absolutely right, it is a massive problem.	0
673	TRUMP	But we have to do something about that problem.	0
674	TRUMP	And the best thing we can do is set up a court system within the military.	0
675	TRUMP	Right now, the court system practically doesn’t exist.	0
676	TRUMP	It takes too long.	0
677	LAUER	In 2013, on this subject, you tweeted this, quote, “26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military, only 238 convictions.	0
678	LAUER	What did these geniuses expect when they put men and women together?”	0
679	TRUMP	Well, it is — it is — it is a correct tweet.	0
680	TRUMP	There are many people that think that that’s absolutely correct.	0
681	TRUMP	And we need to have a…	0
682	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
683	LAUER	So this should have been expected?	0
684	LAUER	And does that mean the only way to fix it is to take women out of the military?	0
685	TRUMP	Well, it’s happening, right?	0
686	TRUMP	And, by the way, since then, it’s gotten worse.	0
687	TRUMP	No, not to take them out, but something has to be happen.	0
688	TRUMP	Right now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted.	0
689	TRUMP	You have reported and — the gentleman can tell you, you have the report of rape and nobody gets prosecuted.	0
690	TRUMP	There are no consequence.	0
691	TRUMP	When you have somebody that does something so evil, so bad as that, there has to be consequence for that person.	0
692	TRUMP	You have to go after that person.	0
693	TRUMP	Right now, nobody’s doing anything.	0
694	TRUMP	Look at the small number of results.	0
695	TRUMP	I mean, that’s part of the problem.	0
696	LAUER	So many of the issues that we’ve talked about with you, Mr. Trump, tonight, and Secretary Clinton, are so complex that even career military people and career diplomats and politicians have trouble getting their arms around them.	0
697	TRUMP	Right.	0
698	LAUER	You’ve had a very different background, in business.	0
699	LAUER	So nobody would expect you to have taken over the last 20 years really deep dives into some of these issues.	0
700	LAUER	But I’m curious about what you’re doing now.	0
701	LAUER	What kind of research are you doing now?	0
702	LAUER	What kind of homework are you doing?	0
703	LAUER	What kind of things are you reading as you prepare for the day in two months where you might be elected the next president of the United States?	0
704	TRUMP	Sure.	0
705	TRUMP	Well, in the front row, you have four generals.	0
706	TRUMP	You have admirals.	0
707	TRUMP	We have people all throughout the audience that I’m dealing with.	0
708	TRUMP	Right here is a list that was just printed today of 88 admirals and generals that I meet with and I talk to.	0
709	LAUER	How much time are you spending on this?	0
710	TRUMP	I’m also — a lot.	0
711	TRUMP	A lot.	0
712	TRUMP	And I’m doing a lot of different things.	0
713	TRUMP	Don’t forget, we’re running a big campaign.	0
714	TRUMP	We’re doing very well.	0
715	TRUMP	I’m also, you know, and I’m very much giving it to my children and my executives to run, I’m also partially running a business.	0
716	TRUMP	I’m campaigning, I’m running a business.	0
717	TRUMP	I’ve got a lot of hats right now.	0
718	TRUMP	But we’re doing very well.	0
719	TRUMP	But in the meantime, I am studying.	0
720	TRUMP	And I’m meeting constantly — you see — you see General Flynn and you see some of the folks that we have, and they’re scattered throughout the audience.	0
721	TRUMP	So we have admirals, we have generals, we have colonels.	0
722	TRUMP	We have a lot of people that I respect.	0
723	TRUMP	And I think I’ve learned a lot.	0
724	TRUMP	But I think, also, I certainly — I really feel I have a common sense on the various issues that you’re talking about, Matt.	0
725	LAUER	You said in the speech today, you said history shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is the greatest.	0
726	TRUMP	And we’re not prepared.	0
727	LAUER	Will you be prepared on day one, if you’re elected president of the United States, to tackle these complex national security issues?	0
728	TRUMP	One hundred percent.	0
729	TRUMP	Hey, Matt, again, she made a mistake on Libya.	0
730	TRUMP	She made a terrible mistake on Libya.	0
731	TRUMP	And the next thing, I mean, not only did she make the mistake, but then they complicated the mistake by having no management once they bombed you know what out of Gadhafi.	0
732	TRUMP	I mean, she made a terrible mistake on Libya.	0
733	TRUMP	And part of it was the management aftereffect.	0
734	TRUMP	I think that we have great management talents, great management skills.	0
735	LAUER	But you are prepared?	0
736	TRUMP	And I have to tell you — totally prepared.	0
737	TRUMP	But remember this.	0
738	TRUMP	I found this subject and these subjects of interest all of my life, Matt.	0
739	TRUMP	This hasn’t been over the last 14 months.	0
740	TRUMP	I’ve found these substantiates of tremendous interest.	0
741	TRUMP	That’s why they were asking me about Iraq 14 years ago.	0
742	TRUMP	They were asking me these questions.	0
743	TRUMP	They don’t ask businesspeople those questions.	0
744	LAUER	Let me end in kind of the same place I started.	0
745	LAUER	Have you given much thought, Mr. Trump, if you’re elected president and commander-in-chief, to that moment where you’re going to have to make that first decision that puts American men and women in harm’s way?	0
746	TRUMP	I think it’s the most difficult decision you can possibly ever make.	0
747	TRUMP	You’re talking about death.	0
748	TRUMP	And we’re talking death to not just our side.	0
749	TRUMP	We’re talking death all over.	0
750	TRUMP	I would be very, very cautious.	0
751	TRUMP	I think I’d be a lot slower.	0
752	TRUMP	She has a happy trigger.	0
753	TRUMP	You look, she votes for the wars, she goes in Libya…	0
754	SYSTEM	(CROSSTALK)	0
755	LAUER	Have you thought about personally the emotional burden of that moment?	0
756	TRUMP	I think it’s a tremendous burden.	0
757	TRUMP	I think there is no greater burden that anybody could have.	0
758	TRUMP	I’ve been preparing this for a long time.	0
759	TRUMP	And, you know, my theme is make America great again.	0
760	TRUMP	We’re going to make America great again.	0
761	TRUMP	But, Matt, we’ve also got to make America strong again.	0
762	TRUMP	And right now, we are not strong.	0
763	TRUMP	Believe me.	0
764	TRUMP	We have a depleted military.	0
765	TRUMP	We have the greatest people in the world in our military.	0
766	TRUMP	But it is very sadly depleted.	0
767	LAUER	The Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald Trump.	0
768	TRUMP	Thank you, Matt.	0
769	LAUER	Thank you.	0
770	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
771	LAUER	We’re going to be much — we’ll be back with much more from the Intrepid carrier on this Commander-in-Chief Forum right after this.	0
772	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
773	LAUER	There’s a lot of people we want to thank for making tonight a success, the presidential nominees themselves, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.	0
774	LAUER	We want to thank the many veterans in our audience for their questions and, most importantly, for their service.	0
775	LAUER	We want to thank our hosts at the IAVA, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and, of course, the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum, this amazing venue.	0
776	LAUER	The first presidential debate will be held on September 26th right here on NBC.	0
777	LAUER	It’ll be hosted by my colleague, Lester Holt.	0
778	LAUER	We hope you’ll tune in for that.	0
779	LAUER	And more importantly, we hope you get out and vote this November.	0
780	LAUER	Nothing could be more important.	0
781	LAUER	Thank you for joining us tonight.	0
782	LAUER	For Matt Lauer — I’m Matt Lauer.	0
783	LAUER	For all of us at NBC News, we appreciate your tuning in.	0
