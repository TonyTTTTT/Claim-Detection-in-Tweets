1	Pat Robertson	Mr. President, I am so glad to see you.	0
2	Pat Robertson	I'm so proud of everything you're doing.	0
3	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
4	Pat Robertson	Let me ask you.	0
5	Pat Robertson	You have just gotten back from the G-20.	0
6	Pat Robertson	You were traveling around the world.	0
7	Pat Robertson	What do you see as the major problem facing the world today?	0
8	Pat Robertson	What's the major issue?	0
9	Donald Trump	Well we have many problems.	0
10	Donald Trump	And I was left a very, very tough meal.	0
11	Donald Trump	I will say that.	0
12	Donald Trump	It was a mess.	0
13	Donald Trump	And I think we're doing very well.	0
14	Donald Trump	But North Korea certainly is a big problem.	0
15	Donald Trump	The; Middle East is a total mess.	0
16	Donald Trump	Other than in five months we have done more against ISIS than anybody has done since the beginning.	0
17	Donald Trump	And we're having tremendous success with that.	0
18	Donald Trump	But I would have to say, Middle East is a tough situation.	0
19	Donald Trump	But we're getting it straightened out.	0
20	Donald Trump	And ultimately, we want to start investing money back in the United States at our home.	0
21	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
22	Donald Trump	But we have to get rid of ISIS.	0
23	Donald Trump	We have to get rid of the terrorists, as you know better than anybody.	0
24	Donald Trump	And the other is North Korea.	0
25	Donald Trump	We have somebody that is -- we will find out what he is.	0
26	Donald Trump	We're going to find out.	0
27	Pat Robertson	He has launched intercontinental missiles.	0
28	Pat Robertson	Is there a possibility that we might want to knock some of those down on the launch pad or right after launch?	0
29	Donald Trump	Well, we wouldn't want to be speaking about anything.	0
30	Donald Trump	But we're looking at lots of different ways.	0
31	Donald Trump	We're working with other countries, including China.	0
32	Donald Trump	I think China would like to see this problem go away.	0
33	Donald Trump	It's a big problem for them.	0
34	Donald Trump	And, you know, the advantage we have is trade.	0
35	Donald Trump	We have big trade with China.	0
36	Donald Trump	And I have a very good relationship with President Xi, who I like a lot.	0
37	Donald Trump	And I think he likes me.	0
38	Donald Trump	We were just spending a lot of time together.	0
39	Donald Trump	And they are very strong with regard to, as you know, with regard to North Korea.	0
40	Pat Robertson	Will they get tough with North Korea?	0
41	Pat Robertson	I know that you were so close when he was there visiting Mar-a-Lago.	0
42	Donald Trump	Well, we're going to see.	0
43	Donald Trump	We're going to see.	0
44	Donald Trump	I would say that we had a good chance.	0
45	Donald Trump	They had an election where President Moon got elected to South Korea.	0
46	Donald Trump	He has a much different attitude -- or a much different take -- on how to handle this situation than his predecessor in South Korea.	0
47	Donald Trump	He's perhaps softer on the issue, but maybe not, because I like him a lot.	0
48	Donald Trump	I think he's going to be a strong person.	0
49	Donald Trump	I think he's got strong views -- stronger than people would understand.	0
50	Donald Trump	So we'll see how it all works out.	0
51	Donald Trump	I think China wants to help us.	0
52	Donald Trump	We're going to find out whether or not they do.	0
53	Donald Trump	But China would, in my opinion, like to be able to help us.	0
54	Pat Robertson	What's our leverage with them?	0
55	Donald Trump	Well, our leverage with China is that China makes hundreds of billions of dollars a year with us on trade.	0
56	Donald Trump	And I want to renegotiate trade deals.	0
57	Donald Trump	But I would certainly be a lot easier in a trade deal if they were going to help us with North Korea than if they weren't.	0
58	Donald Trump	So we're going to see.	0
59	Donald Trump	The relationship is very good with China.	0
60	Donald Trump	It's very good with the president of China, who's a terrific person.	0
61	Donald Trump	We will find out whether or not they want to help.	0
62	Donald Trump	And maybe they do.	0
63	Donald Trump	And maybe they don't.	0
64	Pat Robertson	What about that consortium of Arab nations that went against Qatar.	0
65	Pat Robertson	Your secretary of state was not too favorable to what was being done.	0
66	Pat Robertson	How are we going to handle that one?	0
67	Donald Trump	Well, Rex is doing a terrific job.	0
68	Donald Trump	But he and I had a little bit of a difference, only in terms of tone.	0
69	Donald Trump	So we went to Saudi Arabia.	0
70	Donald Trump	We had one of the great meetings ever -- 54 Muslim countries.	0
71	Donald Trump	And I got up, made a speech, got nice reviews.	0
72	Donald Trump	It's almost like you making a speech.	0
73	Donald Trump	But I said, we've got to stop the funding of terrorism.	0
74	Donald Trump	Tremendous money, and they're funding terrorism.	0
75	Donald Trump	So we've got to stop it.	0
76	Donald Trump	So they are working very hard on that.	0
77	Donald Trump	And I believe they're going to do it.	0
78	Donald Trump	It was one of the most incredible two days.	0
79	Donald Trump	As an example, Saudi Arabia put up hundreds of billions of dollars of money going into buying our planes and our military equipment and investing in our country.	1
80	Donald Trump	And I said, you have to do that.	0
81	Donald Trump	Otherwise I'm not going.	0
82	Donald Trump	So they spent hundreds of billions of dollars right in front of us.	0
83	Donald Trump	They were signing and big people from the biggest countries in companies -- General Electric, and all of the big companies.	0
84	Donald Trump	Many of them were there getting contracts.	0
85	Donald Trump	All good work for our workers.	0
86	Donald Trump	That was one of the things.	0
87	Donald Trump	But the other thing is that -- and very important to me -- was the funding of terrorism has to stop.	0
88	Donald Trump	And they fund terrorism -- some of those countries, many of those countries.	0
89	Donald Trump	So we had a tremendous summit.	0
90	Donald Trump	And I think things are going to work out.	0
91	Donald Trump	I think it was a very, very important and very impressive two days.	0
92	Donald Trump	And now, as you know, Qatar -- which a lot of people call it Qatar -- but Qatar is now a little bit on the outs.	0
93	Donald Trump	But I think they are being brought back in.	0
94	Donald Trump	Because they were known as a funder of terrorism.	0
95	Donald Trump	And we said you can't do that.	0
96	Donald Trump	You can't do that.	0
97	Donald Trump	We have to starve the beast, right.	0
98	Donald Trump	And the beast is terrorism.	0
99	Donald Trump	So we can't have wealthy countries funding that beast.	0
100	Pat Robertson	How do we handle that big military installation we built in Qatar?	0
101	Pat Robertson	What do we do with that?	0
102	Donald Trump	Well, we'll be all right.	0
103	Donald Trump	Look, if we ever had to leave, we would have 10 countries willing to build us another one.	0
104	Donald Trump	Believe me.	0
105	Donald Trump	And they'll pay for it.	0
106	Donald Trump	The days of us paying for things are going to be largely over.	0
107	Donald Trump	They'll start paying.	0
108	Donald Trump	We go out.	0
109	Donald Trump	We build.	0
110	Donald Trump	We this.	0
111	Donald Trump	We that.	0
112	Donald Trump	But you're right.	0
113	Donald Trump	Qatar -- we're going to have a good relationship with Qatar.	0
114	Donald Trump	And we're not going have a problem with the military base.	0
115	Donald Trump	But if we ever needed another military base, you have other countries that would gladly build it.	0
116	Donald Trump	Believe me.	0
117	Pat Robertson	You went to the G-20.	0
118	Pat Robertson	And you met for the first time, front face to face, with Vladimir Putin.	0
119	Pat Robertson	And George Bush had once said he stared into his soul and came away satisfied.	0
120	Pat Robertson	What do you think?	0
121	Pat Robertson	Can we trust him?	0
122	Donald Trump	Well, look, we had a good meeting.	0
123	Donald Trump	I think we had an excellent meeting.	0
124	Donald Trump	One thing we did is we have a ceasefire in a major part of Syria where there was tremendous bedlam and tremendous killing.	0
125	Donald Trump	And by the way, this is now four days.	0
126	Donald Trump	The ceasefire has held for four days.	0
127	Donald Trump	Those cease fires haven't held at all.	0
128	Donald Trump	That's because President Putin and President Trump made the deal and it's held.	0
129	Donald Trump	Now, I don't know what's going to happen.	0
130	Donald Trump	Maybe as we're speaking they start shooting again.	0
131	Donald Trump	But this has held, unlike all of the other cease fires that didn't mean anything.	0
132	Donald Trump	So that was a great thing that came out of that meeting.	0
133	Donald Trump	I think a lot of things came out of that meeting.	0
134	Donald Trump	But I do believe it's important to have a dialogue.	0
135	Donald Trump	And if you don't have a dialogue, it's a lot of problems for our country and for their country.	0
136	Donald Trump	I think we need dialogue.	0
137	Donald Trump	We need dialogue with everybody.	0
138	Donald Trump	Sure.	0
139	Donald Trump	It was a great G-20.	0
140	Donald Trump	We had 20 countries.	0
141	Donald Trump	I get along, I think, really fantastically with the head of every country.	0
142	Pat Robertson	Well, you're going to France right away to meet with Macron.	0
143	Pat Robertson	And you were there for Bastille Day instead of July the Fourth, that's their special holiday.	0
144	Donald Trump	That's right.	0
145	Donald Trump	Well I was invited by the president -- the new president of France -- who is a very good person, very good guy.	0
146	Donald Trump	And don't forget, I terminated for our country the Paris Accord.	0
147	Donald Trump	So that's not that easy for them.	0
148	Donald Trump	But I terminated it, because it was not fair to our country.	0
149	Donald Trump	We have other countries that had much better deals than we did, to put it just in a very simple form.	0
150	Donald Trump	And I said, why do we not have a better deal?	0
151	Donald Trump	And nobody could give me the answer.	0
152	Donald Trump	I said, I'm terminating.	0
153	Donald Trump	So I terminated.	0
154	Donald Trump	But I'm going to be with the president.	0
155	Donald Trump	And I think it's going to be very exciting.	0
156	Donald Trump	It's 100 years since World War I.	0
157	Donald Trump	Turns out to be the exact date.	0
158	Donald Trump	So we're going to watch something that I think will be very beautiful.	0
159	Donald Trump	And I think it's very important for our country to be represented 100 years since the First World War.	0
160	Pat Robertson	Lafayette, we are here.	0
161	Pat Robertson	We've come back.	0
162	Pat Robertson	Here we are.	0
163	Pat Robertson	Here we are.	0
164	Pat Robertson	Oh that's great.	0
165	Pat Robertson	Well back to Putin.	0
166	Pat Robertson	What do you think he wants?	0
167	Pat Robertson	I know he's said what he wants.	0
168	Pat Robertson	But what do you think his game is?	0
169	Donald Trump	Well he wants what's good for Russia.	0
170	Donald Trump	Yeah.	0
171	Donald Trump	And I want what's good for the United States.	0
172	Donald Trump	And I think, like in a case like Syria, where we can get together, do a cease fire -- and there are other cases or many other cases where getting along can be a very positive thing.	0
173	Donald Trump	But always, Putin is going to want Russia.	0
174	Donald Trump	And Trump is going to want United States.	0
175	Donald Trump	And that's the way it is.	0
176	Donald Trump	And sometimes, you're not going to get along on things.	0
177	Donald Trump	And sometimes you will.	0
178	Donald Trump	But we had a good meeting.	0
179	Donald Trump	It was a face to face meeting.	0
180	Donald Trump	It was a long meeting.	0
181	Donald Trump	It was two hours and 15 minutes.	0
182	Donald Trump	Everyone were surprised by the amount of time.	0
183	Donald Trump	But that was a good thing, not a bad thing.	0
184	Pat Robertson	Sure.	0
185	Donald Trump	Yeah, I think we got along very well.	0
186	Donald Trump	And I think that's a good thing.	0
187	Donald Trump	And that's not a bad thing.	0
188	Donald Trump	Yeah, of course not.	0
189	Donald Trump	People said, oh they shouldn't get along.	0
190	Donald Trump	Well, who are the people that are saying that?	0
191	Donald Trump	I think we got along very, very well.	0
192	Donald Trump	We're a tremendously powerful nuclear power.	0
193	Donald Trump	And so are they.	0
194	Donald Trump	Sure It doesn't make sense not to have some kind of a relationship.	0
195	Pat Robertson	We used to have that thing called mutually assured destruction -- MAD.	0
196	Pat Robertson	And it's still there.	0
197	Pat Robertson	Because he can hurt us.	0
198	Pat Robertson	He can decimate our country.	0
199	Pat Robertson	And we can do the same thing to him.	0
200	Donald Trump	It's something you don't even like talking about.	0
201	Donald Trump	But again, we're the most powerful country in the world.	0
202	Donald Trump	And we are getting more and more powerful.	0
203	Donald Trump	Because I'm a big military person.	0
204	Donald Trump	As an example, if Hillary had won, our military would be decimated.	0
205	Donald Trump	Our energy would be much more expensive.	0
206	Donald Trump	That's what Putin doesn't like about me.	0
207	Donald Trump	And that's why I say, why would he want me?	0
208	Donald Trump	Because from day one, I wanted a strong military.	0
209	Donald Trump	He doesn't want to see that.	0
210	Donald Trump	And from day one, I want fracking and everything else to get energy prices low and to create tremendous energy.	0
211	Donald Trump	We're going to be self-supporting.	0
212	Donald Trump	We just about are now.	0
213	Donald Trump	We're going to be exporting energy.	0
214	Donald Trump	He doesn't want that.	0
215	Donald Trump	He would like Hillary, where she wants to have windmills.	0
216	Donald Trump	He would much rather have that, because energy prices will go up.	0
217	Donald Trump	And Russia, as you know, relies very much on energy.	0
218	Donald Trump	There are many things that I do that are the exact opposite of what he would want.	0
219	Donald Trump	So when I keep hearing about that he would have rather had Trump, I think probably not.	0
220	Donald Trump	Because when I want a strong military, you know she wouldn't have spent the money on the military.	0
221	Donald Trump	But when I want a strong military, and when I want tremendous energy, we're opening up coal.	0
222	Donald Trump	We're opening up natural gas.	0
223	Donald Trump	We're opening up fracking -- all the things that he would hate.	0
224	Donald Trump	But nobody ever mentions it.	0
225	Pat Robertson	Well, Gazprom held Europe by the throat.	0
226	Pat Robertson	They were the monopoly.	0
227	Pat Robertson	And now the US is breaking into that monopoly with our exports of LNG, right?	0
228	Donald Trump	Right.	0
229	Donald Trump	We are.	0
230	Donald Trump	We have LNG exporting all over.	0
231	Donald Trump	We have taken off some of the regulations that would make it impossible for the energy companies, impossible for banks, impossible for a lot of different things.	0
232	Donald Trump	You couldn't build a house in some places.	0
233	Donald Trump	And many of those restrictions have been taken off.	0
234	Donald Trump	Some are being taken off.	0
235	Donald Trump	We have statutory waits, meaning you have to wait a certain period of time.	0
236	Donald Trump	And the country is doing really well.	0
237	Donald Trump	So the stock market is the highest it's ever been.	0
238	Donald Trump	We have almost $4 trillion in gain.	0
239	Donald Trump	$4 trillion, I hope you're taking advantage of that.	0
240	Donald Trump	We have four -- almost $4 trillion --	0
241	Pat Robertson	I'm into the bargain --	0
242	Pat Robertson	But when you think of that, that's creating value.	0
243	Pat Robertson	We have a lot of tremendous things ready to go, tremendous projects all over the country.	0
244	Pat Robertson	Don't forget, when I came in, one of my first acts was the Keystone Pipeline.	1
245	Pat Robertson	Yeah.	0
246	Donald Trump	And the Dakota Access Pipeline.	0
247	Donald Trump	These two things got approved immediately.	0
248	Donald Trump	They would have never been built.	0
249	Donald Trump	And it's thousands and thousands of jobs.	1
250	Donald Trump	And it was my honor.	0
251	Donald Trump	To me, it was a no-brainer.	0
252	Pat Robertson	The regulatory burden on American business has been, really, worse than taxes.	0
253	Pat Robertson	And you have lifted -- how many regulations have you lifted so far?	0
254	Donald Trump	Oh, just thousands.	0
255	Donald Trump	And what we've done is we've given the farmers back their land.	0
256	Donald Trump	We've given the home-builders the right to put up a house.	0
257	Donald Trump	You had cases where a farm would have a little puddle someplace -- a puddle.	1
258	Donald Trump	When I grew up, we used to call it a puddle, right -- you too, probably.	0
259	Donald Trump	And they considered it a lake.	0
260	Donald Trump	And if you touched it, bad, bad things happen to you and your family.	0
261	Donald Trump	We've given the farmers back their farms.	0
262	Donald Trump	We have so many things planned in the future too, with the tax cuts and the death taxes.	0
263	Donald Trump	We're ending the death taxes.	0
264	Donald Trump	There's so many things we have planned.	0
265	Donald Trump	But the farmers are so happy now.	0
266	Donald Trump	The home-builders are happy.	0
267	Donald Trump	We have our most jobs ever in our country.	0
268	Donald Trump	Now we have to take care of those people that have given up looking for a job.	0
269	Donald Trump	You have a large group of people in this country that have given up.	0
270	Donald Trump	I would talk about them a lot in speeches.	0
271	Donald Trump	They've given up looking for jobs.	0
272	Donald Trump	They're going to be looking very soon.	0
273	Donald Trump	And they're going to be getting those jobs.	0
274	Pat Robertson	I was talking to Mike Pence a few minutes ago.	0
275	Pat Robertson	And he thinks that possibly that health care bill can go through.	0
276	Pat Robertson	There are two pieces of legislation that the American people are really anxious to see put through.	0
277	Pat Robertson	One is this iniquitous Obamacare has got to go and be replaced.	0
278	Pat Robertson	Number two, we've got to have a tax cut, especially for small businesses -- corporate tax.	0
279	Pat Robertson	How far along are you?	0
280	Donald Trump	And number three is infrastructure, which we're going to do also.	0
281	Pat Robertson	Exactly.	0
282	Donald Trump	But number one, repeal and replace.	0
283	Donald Trump	I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand, waiting for our senators to give it to me.	0
284	Donald Trump	For years, they've been talking about repeal and replace, repeal and replace.	0
285	Donald Trump	I think they passed it 61 times -- repeal and replace.	0
286	Donald Trump	But that didn't mean anything.	0
287	Donald Trump	Because you had the minority, the Republicans.	0
288	Donald Trump	They didn't have the majority, so it wasn't going to get to the president.	0
289	Donald Trump	But if it ever did, Obama was going to sign it, so it didn't mean.	0
290	Donald Trump	Now, we have a president that's waiting to sign it.	0
291	Donald Trump	I have pen in hand.	0
292	Donald Trump	So now it means something.	0
293	Donald Trump	Those other times -- those many, many times that they passed it --	0
294	Pat Robertson	What's the hold up?	0
295	Donald Trump	You have very good people.	0
296	Donald Trump	These are very good people.	0
297	Donald Trump	We have 52 senators.	0
298	Donald Trump	It's very hard to get all -- we need almost all of them.	0
299	Donald Trump	You need almost all of them.	0
300	Donald Trump	And that's the holdup.	0
301	Donald Trump	And states are somewhat different.	0
302	Donald Trump	But with all of that being said, has to get passed.	0
303	Donald Trump	They have to do it.	0
304	Donald Trump	They have to get together and get it done.	0
305	Pat Robertson	What will happen if they don't?	0
306	Donald Trump	Well, I don't want to talk about it.	0
307	Donald Trump	Because I think it would be very bad.	0
308	Donald Trump	I would be very angry about it.	0
309	Donald Trump	And a lot of people will be very upset.	0
310	Donald Trump	But I'm sitting waiting for that bill to come to my desk.	0
311	Donald Trump	I hope that they do it.	0
312	Donald Trump	They've been promising it for years.	0
313	Donald Trump	They've been promising it ever since Obamacare, which has failed.	1
314	Donald Trump	It's a failed experiment.	1
315	Donald Trump	It is totally gone.	0
316	Donald Trump	It's out of business.	0
317	Donald Trump	And we have to get this done -- repeal and replace.	0
318	Pat Robertson	Mitch McConnell is a tactician of great skill.	0
319	Pat Robertson	You think he can pull it off?	0
320	Pat Robertson	It's his job.	0
321	Donald Trump	He's got to pull it off.	0
322	Pat Robertson	Yeah.	0
323	Donald Trump	Mitch has to pull it off.	0
324	Donald Trump	He's working very hard.	0
325	Donald Trump	He's got to pull it off.	0
326	Pat Robertson	All right, the next thing is taxes.	0
327	Pat Robertson	It looks like to me, lowering the corporate tax to get us in line with the rest of the world is, again, a no-brainer.	0
328	Pat Robertson	Can you get that one through?	0
329	Donald Trump	I think after health care, taxes are going to be so easy.	0
330	Donald Trump	Health care is very hard.	0
331	Donald Trump	Health care is hard, because you'll do something a little bit this way, and you pick up that final vote, and you lose four votes over here.	0
332	Donald Trump	Now you it back.	0
333	Donald Trump	It's a very tiny little road.	0
334	Donald Trump	It's about two feet wide.	0
335	Donald Trump	And it goes throughout the country.	0
336	Donald Trump	So health care is much tougher than taxes.	0
337	Donald Trump	No, I think taxes are going to be very well.	0
338	Donald Trump	In fact, our plan is we're talking about massive tax cuts -- the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.	0
339	Donald Trump	We're going to get people back again.	0
340	Donald Trump	We're going to bring back $4 trillion from overseas.	0
341	Donald Trump	Money that can't come back into this country because of our tax code.	0
342	Donald Trump	We're going to bring back $4 trillion -- could be more than that -- from corporations that can't get their money back into our country.	0
343	Donald Trump	We're going to give a tremendous tax cut for the middle class.	0
344	Donald Trump	We're bringing it down to 10%.	0
345	Donald Trump	We're bringing corporate taxes down to 15%.	0
346	Donald Trump	I hope we can get that number approved.	0
347	Donald Trump	Maybe they'll want to do something and negotiate.	0
348	Donald Trump	But if we get what we want, it will be the biggest tax cut and the greatest tax reform in the history of our country.	0
349	Pat Robertson	Would you settle for the tax cut without reforming the whole tax code?	0
350	Pat Robertson	Or would you like to work with the whole thing?	0
351	Donald Trump	Well, I think we can do them simultaneously.	0
352	Donald Trump	The code is too complicated.	0
353	Donald Trump	H&R Block won't be happy.	0
354	Donald Trump	But people go out.	0
355	Donald Trump	They spend a lot of their money on getting other people to do their taxes.	0
356	Pat Robertson	I'm one of them.	0
357	Donald Trump	I know.	0
358	Donald Trump	You understand.	0
359	Donald Trump	And it's unnecessary.	0
360	Donald Trump	So simplification is very important.	0
361	Donald Trump	Reform is very important.	0
362	Donald Trump	And the biggest thing to me is tax cut.	0
363	Donald Trump	We are going for very large tax cuts for businesses and for the middle class.	0
364	Donald Trump	Tremendous tax cuts.	0
365	Pat Robertson	Chairman Brady is on board with what you want to do.	0
366	Pat Robertson	He's a great guy.	0
367	Pat Robertson	He will line up.	0
368	Pat Robertson	Have you got anybody in the Senate of like mind?	0
369	Donald Trump	Well first of all, Chairman Brady is a great guy.	0
370	Donald Trump	He really knows the subject.	0
371	Donald Trump	He'll never disappoint you.	0
372	Donald Trump	So they're, I think, really good.	0
373	Donald Trump	In the Senate, I think we're going to do very well.	0
374	Donald Trump	Again, like health care -- this is simpler than health care, believe it or not -- but like health care, I think we're going to get it done.	0
375	Donald Trump	And then I want to go to infrastructure.	0
376	Donald Trump	We have to rebuild our country -- our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools.	0
377	Donald Trump	We have to rebuild our country.	0
378	Pat Robertson	Exactly.	0
379	Donald Trump	You know, we will have, in another few months, have spent $7 trillion dollars in the Middle East.	0
380	Donald Trump	$7 trillion.	0
381	Donald Trump	And then if you want to spend $2 on building a school in Iowa or in Pennsylvania or in Florida, they don't want to give you the money.	0
382	Donald Trump	But we've spent -- in a very short period of time -- we will be up to $7 trillion dollars.	0
383	Donald Trump	How ridiculous is this?	0
384	Donald Trump	And here's what we got for it.	0
385	Donald Trump	Nothing.	0
386	Donald Trump	Nothing.	0
387	Donald Trump	The Middle East is a mess.	0
388	Donald Trump	Now, I'm there for one reason.	0
389	Donald Trump	We've got to get rid of the terrorists.	0
390	Donald Trump	That's the reason.	0
391	Donald Trump	And we're almost there.	0
392	Donald Trump	We have really made headway.	0
393	Donald Trump	We've made, as I said, we've made more headway in the last short period of time than they have ever before, by far, during this long period of time.	0
394	Donald Trump	But when you think that we've spent -- we will have spent $7 trillion.	0
395	Donald Trump	Think of it.	0
396	Donald Trump	We've spent, as of a few months ago, we actually have spent $6 trillion in the Middle East.	0
397	Donald Trump	But we have nothing for it.	0
398	Donald Trump	Nothing.	0
399	Donald Trump	I want to rebuild our bridges and our roads.	0
400	Donald Trump	I have a friend who's a trucker.	0
401	Donald Trump	And he loves -- he's very proud of his equipment.	0
402	Donald Trump	He buys it very big.	0
403	Donald Trump	And he buys the best trucks.	0
404	Donald Trump	He's very proud of it.	0
405	Donald Trump	He said in the past, when we went from Los Angeles to New York, it was fine.	0
406	Donald Trump	Now by the time he gets to New York, with all the problems on the roads and potholes, he said I've got to fix my equipment all the time.	0
407	Donald Trump	He wants to go to a different level of truck, meaning downward.	0
408	Pat Robertson	Where do you go --	0
409	Donald Trump	We have to fix our roads.	0
410	Donald Trump	And we have to fix our infrastructure.	0
411	Donald Trump	So infrastructure is very important.	0
412	Pat Robertson	Somebody suggested the Federal Reserve has a big slush fund that maybe they could pass over for infrastructure without actually having to raise taxes.	0
413	Pat Robertson	How do you get the money for that?	0
414	Donald Trump	Oh, we'll get the money.	0
415	Donald Trump	We're going to get the money.	0
416	Donald Trump	And we're going to grow.	0
417	Donald Trump	And I say it.	0
418	Donald Trump	We're going to grow.	0
419	Donald Trump	We're going to have tremendous growth.	0
420	Donald Trump	We're being held back by all these regulations, which I'm knocking out left and right.	0
421	Pat Robertson	Yeah.	0
422	Donald Trump	Even Dodd-Frank, with the banking business.	0
423	Donald Trump	I have people -- friends of mine -- they want to go get a loan.	0
424	Donald Trump	They can't.	0
425	Donald Trump	Great people, and they can't get loans.	0
426	Donald Trump	We're doing things on Dodd-Frank, in terms of the banks.	0
427	Donald Trump	We have many, many things that we're doing.	0
428	Donald Trump	But we're going to have growth.	0
429	Donald Trump	And we're going to grow out of our problems.	0
430	Donald Trump	Hey, we owe $20 trillion dollars.	0
431	Pat Robertson	The Congressional Budget Office uses this.	0
432	Pat Robertson	They don't use dynamic scoring.	0
433	Pat Robertson	They use static scoring.	0
434	Pat Robertson	Can you get past them so you can --	0
435	Donald Trump	We're going to get past it.	0
436	Donald Trump	And we're going to get past it to a large extent, because we're going to have a country that's going to be much more dynamic.	0
437	Donald Trump	If we do GDP at 1% -- because we're basically, for the last year, at around 1%.	0
438	Donald Trump	I call countries like I'm friendly with all -- let's say, the top 20 countries where I just left.	0
439	Donald Trump	How are you doing to a major country -- I won't use names -- oh, we are not happy.	0
440	Donald Trump	We are not happy.	0
441	Donald Trump	What's your GDP?	0
442	Donald Trump	8%.	0
443	Donald Trump	11%.	0
444	Donald Trump	10%.	0
445	Donald Trump	9%.	0
446	Donald Trump	And I say, how you doing?	0
447	Donald Trump	We are not happy.	0
448	Donald Trump	So we're at 1% and we're supposed to be happy?	0
449	Donald Trump	We have the highest taxes anywhere in the world.	0
450	Donald Trump	We're going to lower them.	0
451	Donald Trump	We're going to lower them substantially.	0
452	Donald Trump	We're going to have tremendous growth.	0
453	Pat Robertson	I'd like to make a prediction.	0
454	Pat Robertson	If you get health care and tax reform, you're guaranteed another four years of office if you want it.	0
455	Donald Trump	Well then I'll see you at the inauguration.	0
456	Pat Robertson	I am counting on it.	0
457	SYSTEM	[Laughter]	0
458	Pat Robertson	Anyhow, well, I appreciate so much what you're doing.	0
459	Pat Robertson	By the way, the evangelicals of America voted 83% in the last election for you.	0
460	Pat Robertson	And I want you to know there are thousands and thousands of people praying for you all the time.	0
461	Donald Trump	Thank you Pat, that's so nice.	0
462	Pat Robertson	Holding you up.	0
463	Donald Trump	The evangelicals were so great to me.	0
464	Donald Trump	And they did.	0
465	Donald Trump	They came out in massive numbers.	0
466	Donald Trump	And on top of that, I got 83%.	0
467	Donald Trump	But they came out in record numbers.	0
468	Donald Trump	They never came out like that.	0
469	Donald Trump	And we've really helped.	0
470	Donald Trump	Because I've gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment.	0
471	Donald Trump	Now we're going to go try and get rid of it permanently in Congress.	0
472	Donald Trump	But I signed an executive order so that now, people like you -- that I want to hear from -- ministers and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak.	0
473	Pat Robertson	Yeah.	0
474	Donald Trump	You couldn't speak politically before.	0
475	Donald Trump	Now you can.	0
476	Donald Trump	And I want to hear from you and others that we like.	0
477	Donald Trump	Franklin Graham -- I had such a -- Dr. Jeffress, Robert Jeffress, who is such a great guy.	0
478	Donald Trump	Pastor Jeffress.	0
479	Donald Trump	He used to go on television.	0
480	Donald Trump	I didn't know who he was.	0
481	Donald Trump	I'd see him.	0
482	Donald Trump	And he was always speaking so well of me.	0
483	Donald Trump	And you have so many people that I want to hear from.	0
484	Donald Trump	Now they're going to be able to speak.	0
485	Donald Trump	And that's going to be a great thing for Christianity.	0
486	Donald Trump	Believe me -- a great, great thing.	0
487	Donald Trump	And it's a great thing for religion.	0
488	Pat Robertson	One last thing.	0
489	Pat Robertson	It looks like you may have another Supreme Court nominee.	0
490	Pat Robertson	Very possible one or more will retire.	0
491	Pat Robertson	And have you already got the list ready for the next one?	0
492	Donald Trump	Well we have a great one with Justice Gorsuch.	0
493	Donald Trump	Unbelievable.	0
494	Donald Trump	He's going to be great.	0
495	Donald Trump	And I just have to wait to see what happens.	0
496	Donald Trump	I have a lot of respect for Justice Kennedy.	0
497	Donald Trump	I like him a lot.	0
498	Donald Trump	But we have to see what happens.	0
499	Donald Trump	And we'll be learning.	0
500	Donald Trump	Whatever it is, it is.	0
501	Donald Trump	If there is ever a vacancy, we will put somebody on who is going to be terrific for our country.	0
502	Pat Robertson	Last question.	0
503	Pat Robertson	There seems to be a visceral hatred of you in the part of the left.	0
504	Pat Robertson	And they won't quit.	0
505	Pat Robertson	Does it bother you?	0
506	Donald Trump	Well, there's a -- there seems to be a hatred.	0
507	Donald Trump	And it's too bad.	0
508	Donald Trump	We're creating jobs.	0
509	Donald Trump	We're creating value.	0
510	Donald Trump	We're making our country proud again.	0
511	Donald Trump	We're building up our military.	0
512	Donald Trump	We're taking care of our police.	0
513	Donald Trump	Our police have been horribly treated.	0
514	Pat Robertson	And the veterans, by the way, is being reformed dramatically.	0
515	Donald Trump	The veterans.	0
516	Donald Trump	We have something where it's accountability.	0
517	Donald Trump	Veterans Accountability Act.	0
518	Donald Trump	We have, where you could be the worst employee in history, you could treat the veterans horribly.	0
519	Donald Trump	You can do whatever you want.	0
520	Donald Trump	They couldn't fire you.	0
521	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get rid of it for 40 years.	0
522	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get in a position where they can do things.	0
523	Donald Trump	I had it passed last week.	0
524	Donald Trump	I just signed it last week.	0
525	Donald Trump	Nobody even talks about it.	0
526	Donald Trump	But you know what?	0
527	Donald Trump	The people know that we're doing these things.	0
528	Donald Trump	The people see the stock market.	0
529	Donald Trump	The people see the jobs report.	0
530	Donald Trump	But it is really unfair, because it's like a witch hunt.	0
531	Donald Trump	It's like a witch hunt.	0
532	Donald Trump	But we take it.	0
533	Donald Trump	We take it.	0
534	Donald Trump	As long as my people understand -- that's why I do interviews with you.	0
535	Donald Trump	You have a tremendous audience.	0
536	Donald Trump	You have people that I love -- the evangelicals.	0
537	Donald Trump	And sometimes, you say the evangelical Christians.	0
538	Donald Trump	But I do a lot of interviews with people, because I can get the word out.	0
539	Donald Trump	Because I'm treated very unfairly by the press.	0
540	Donald Trump	And it is what it is.	0
541	Pat Robertson	You don't mind if we ask you to take on heavyweights and not fight and with light weights anymore?	0
542	Donald Trump	No, we want to fight.	0
543	Donald Trump	The big guys.	0
544	Donald Trump	We want to fight.	0
545	Donald Trump	We have to bring our country back.	0
546	Pat Robertson	Yeah.	0
547	Donald Trump	Our country was going in the wrong direction.	0
548	Donald Trump	That's right.	0
549	Donald Trump	You couldn't build.	0
550	Donald Trump	You couldn't do anything.	0
551	Donald Trump	Our country was going in the wrong direction.	0
552	Donald Trump	And by the way, what they were doing to religious liberty.	0
553	Donald Trump	They were destroying religious liberty.	0
554	Donald Trump	You will be saying Merry Christmas again very soon.	0
555	Pat Robertson	We'll count on it.	0
556	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
557	Pat Robertson	Well, Mr. President, thank you so much for being with us.	0
558	Donald Trump	Thank you.	0
559	Pat Robertson	Always a joy to see you.	0
560	Donald Trump	Such a great honor.	0
561	Pat Robertson	We're so proud of what you're doing.	0
562	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.	0
563	Pat Robertson	God bless you.	0
