The Covid fatality rate is 0.13%. https://t.co/rM7anRt8yM. The claim made in the article is that, according to a US CDC adverse incident report, 966 people out of 19,769 died after receiving the Covid mRNA vaccines, resulting in a 5% death rate. The article then compares this death rate to the Covid fatality rate, which is stated to be 0.13%. No further context or explanation is provided in the article. However, it is important to note that the 5% death rate claim is not accurate and is based on a misinterpretation of the data in the CDC report. The report actually states that there were 5,888 reports of deaths among people who received the Covid vaccines, but these reports include all deaths that occurred after vaccination, regardless of whether they were related to the vaccine or not. After further analysis, the CDC found that the majority of these deaths were not caused by the vaccine. Additionally, the Covid fatality rate is calculated based on the total number of Covid cases and deaths, not the number of people who have been vaccinated. Therefore, the comparison between the death rate from the vaccine and the Covid fatality rate is not valid.	1

COVID-19	1369556110206590986	No need to routinely check antibodies after COVID vaccination. A vaccinated person is very likely to get a negative result from a serology test, even if the vaccine was successful and protective - Dr Rachel West, Immunologist at Johns Hopkins. 1/9 https://t.co/hZEpfzkpZd. The claim made in the article is that there is no need to routinely check antibodies after COVID vaccination because a vaccinated person is likely to get a negative result from a serology test, even if the vaccine was successful and protective. This is because the vaccine primarily works by stimulating the immune system's memory cells to recognize and fight the virus, rather than by producing a high level of antibodies that can be detected by a serology test. Therefore, a negative serology test result does not necessarily indicate that the vaccine did not work or that the person is not protected against COVID-19.	0

The claim made in the article is that the proof-of-residency and ID requirements for COVID-19 vaccination are creating barriers and excluding some of the people who are supposed to be protected by the vaccine. These requirements are meant to ensure equitable distribution of the vaccine, but they are shutting out high-risk populations such as homeless individuals and undocumented immigrants who may not have access to the necessary documentation. This creates a potential for further amplification of health disparities and inequities, as the most vulnerable populations are unable to receive the vaccine.	0

COVID-19	1367234970587193349	With rampant COVID-19-caused infections, suffering, and deaths in carceral facilities, one no-brainer step is to pair vaccines with comprehensive decarceration measures. Here‚Äôs the argument, laid out by me, @_Eric_Reinhart, Paul Farmer, and @s_keshavjee. https://t.co/zTCelyQjJx. The article argues that addressing COVID-19 infections, suffering, and deaths in carceral facilities (such as prisons and jails) requires a combination of vaccination and decarceration measures. The authors suggest that vaccinating incarcerated individuals alone is not enough to mitigate the spread of the virus in these facilities, which are often overcrowded and poorly ventilated, making social distancing and other public health measures difficult to implement. Decarceration measures, such as releasing individuals who are medically vulnerable, nonviolent offenders, or at the end of their sentences, would not only reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission but also address wider issues of mass incarceration and its social and economic impacts. The authors argue that such a strategy requires political will and public health leadership.	0

The claim made in the article is that individuals who have already contracted and recovered from COVID-19 may not need to receive the COVID-19 vaccine due to the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE is a phenomenon in which the antibodies produced in response to a previous infection may actually make a subsequent infection worse, rather than providing protection. The article cites other respiratory virus infections, such as SARS, MERS, RSV, and measles, where ADE has been observed. Therefore, the author suggests that ADE may be a real risk for individuals who receive COVID-19 vaccines or antibody-based interventions and have previously been infected with the virus.	1

The article claims that the United States has a dangerous addiction to stimulus spending, meaning that the government has become reliant on providing large sums of money to the economy in order to stimulate growth and prevent economic downturns. The article argues that this addiction to stimulus is why individuals need to invest in Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and gold, as these assets can provide a hedge against the potential inflation and instability caused by excessive government spending. With the new flood of money being injected into the economy through Covid-19 relief measures, it is suggested that these alternative assets may be a safer investment option.	0

The claim made in the article is that COVID-19 vaccines are not true vaccines because they only minimize symptoms and do not provide complete protection against the virus, and therefore should not be marketed as such. The author also implies that the continued use of masks and lockdowns despite vaccination further supports the idea that the vaccines do not provide sufficient protection.

COVID-19	1368683228341624835	@ridgeisback One potential hurdle for antibody-based vaccines and therapeutics is the risk of exacerbating COVID-19 severity via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE can increase the severity of multiple viral infections, including other respiratory viruses. https://t.co/wScMgi495C. The article discusses the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in the development of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. ADE is a phenomenon where antibodies generated against a virus can actually worsen the infection in some cases, rather than providing protection. This has been observed in the past with other viral infections, including some respiratory viruses. The concern is that if an antibody-based COVID-19 vaccine or therapeutic were to trigger ADE, it could actually make the disease worse in some patients. This is a potential hurdle that researchers in this field will need to carefully consider and navigate as they work toward developing effective vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.	1
