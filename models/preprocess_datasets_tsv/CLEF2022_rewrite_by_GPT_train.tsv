COVID-19	1363230475368677377	"In Israel, there has been a noted decrease in COVID-19 cases among young people since they began receiving vaccinations. Five weeks ago, vaccinations were made available for those aged 16-18, and the army provided vaccinations to those aged 19-21 two weeks after their first dose. This resulted in a more than 50% drop in cases among these groups, compared to a drop of less than 30% among those who were not vaccinated in the age groups of 13-15 and 22-24. This suggests that vaccinating young people may be effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. A source article is linked below.

However, it's important to note that ALL COVID shots are categorized as THERAPEUTIC rather than actual vaccines since they only work towards minimizing symptoms.
