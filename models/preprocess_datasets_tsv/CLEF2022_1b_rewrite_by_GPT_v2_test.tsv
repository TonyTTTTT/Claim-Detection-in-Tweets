COVID-19	1417933372614119427	As they are about to be intubated, one of the final requests I receive from patients is for the vaccine. Sadly, I have to inform them that it is too late. Don't wait until it's too late, get vaccinated now. https://t.co/Ie3kOAeMxH	0

COVID-19	1424502218783346690	It frustrates me that Americans need to be incentivized and persuaded to receive free COVID vaccines, while individuals in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Africa are in dire need of them but cannot afford them due to their governments' financial constraints. The level of entitlement and conceit is incredibly distasteful.	0
COVID-19	1423351431596290049	To MAGA Christians: please refrain from using the excuse of trusting God as a reason to not get vaccinated.

COVID-19	1436174124125143041	The COVID vaccine mandate by Joe Biden disregards scientific evidence and infringes on the privacy rights of Americans. The federal government lacks the power to compel employers to ensure their workers receive vaccinations.	1
