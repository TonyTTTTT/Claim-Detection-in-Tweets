accuracy: 

The claim is partially accurate. It is true that the UK government and UK press have not been highlighting the fact that the EU is exporting Covid-19 vaccines to other countries, including some to the UK.

COVID-19	1370537129957330948	"Possible claim: The US will have enough COVID-19 vaccines to make them widely available without appointments by the end of May.

This claim appears to be based on President Biden's recent announcement that his administration has secured enough vaccine doses to inoculate all American adults by the end of May, two months ahead of schedule. While this is an ambitious goal, it remains to be seen how quickly and efficiently the vaccines will be distributed and administered across the country. Some experts have expressed concerns about potential bottlenecks and logistical challenges in the vaccine rollout, especially as new variants of the virus emerge and vaccine hesitancy persists in some communities. It's possible that some drug stores or clinics may start offering walk-in appointments or expanded hours as more doses become available, but it's also possible that appointments will still be required in some areas or for certain populations. Ultimately, the speed and success of the vaccination campaign will depend on multiple factors, including public health messaging, community outreach, and vaccine supply and distribution efforts."	0

The statement is unfounded and implies that the government is deliberately concealing negative information about the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.

Moreover, regulatory agencies like the FDA and CDC closely monitor the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and investigate any reports of adverse reactions. They also provide transparent and up-to-date information to healthcare professionals and the public to ensure that the benefits of the vaccines outweigh the potential risks. 

While it is essential to remain vigilant and monitor the long-term effects of the vaccines, spreading baseless mistrust and fear can harm public health efforts and undermine the scientific process."	1

Each insurance policy is different, and it is important to read the terms and exclusions carefully before purchasing.

This claim is partially true. The CDC VAERS system is a passive reporting system, meaning that anyone can report an adverse event following vaccination, regardless of whether or not the event was actually caused by the vaccine. Therefore, it is important to note that not all adverse events reported to VAERS are necessarily caused by the vaccine. Additionally, the report only shows raw data and does not provide a detailed analysis of the reported adverse events. 

However, it is true that the latest VAERS report shows 1,265 deaths and 4,424 serious injuries reported following Covid-19 vaccination. It is also true that 47% of reported deaths occurred within 48 hours of vaccination, although this does not necessarily prove that the vaccine caused the deaths. It is important to note that the overwhelming majority of people who receive the Covid-19 vaccine do not experience any serious adverse effects.

This claim is partially true but misleading. 

It is true that President Biden announced on January 12, 2021, that his administration would release all available doses of the COVID-19 vaccine instead of holding back second doses for people who already received their first. However, the claim that there was suddenly no reserved vaccine is false. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that second doses are guaranteed and that they are tracking vaccine allocation and distribution to ensure that second doses are available. The decision to release all available doses was based on the fact that production was increasing and there was confidence that manufacturers could provide enough doses for both first and second shots. 

Additionally, the tweet suggests that Biden's decision led to the missing vaccine, but there is no evidence to support this claim. It is also important to note that the article linked in the tweet is an opinion piece, not a news article, and should be evaluated with that in mind."	1

This claim is false and has no scientific basis. The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) have been extensively tested in clinical trials and have been shown to be safe and effective for people of all ages, including older adults. In fact, older adults have been prioritized for vaccine distribution in many countries due to their increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.

The mRNA vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been authorized for emergency use by regulatory agencies around the world, including the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. The vaccines have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19, and are an essential tool in controlling the spread of the virus.

In fact, many African countries are actively working on developing their own treatments and vaccines for Covid-19.

Additionally, it is important to note that not all vaccines developed outside of Africa are ""fake"" or ineffective. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and approval processes before they are made available to the public. It is unfair and misleading to make blanket statements about the efficacy of vaccines from certain countries without concrete evidence."	1

It is true that animal trials for mRNA vaccines in 2012 resulted in immune cytokine storm response when they were later exposed to a wild cold virus, which caused some animals to become very sick and die. However, it is not accurate to say that these were the same mRNA vaccines used for COVID-19, as mRNA technology has significantly advanced in the past decade. 

Furthermore, it is important to note that the animal trials conducted for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines involved rigorous testing and safety protocols before human trials were conducted. The vaccines also went through extensive clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people before receiving emergency use authorization from regulatory agencies.

Therefore, it is not accurate to make a direct comparison between the animal trials from 2012 and the current COVID-19 vaccines. While there may be some potential side effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccines, they have been shown to be highly effective and safe for the vast majority of people who receive them."	1

COVID-19	1366674097082540035	"mRNA and DNA COVID-19 vaccines are gene therapies, not traditional vaccines made with live or attenuated viruses, and they do not meet the medical or legal definition of a vaccine. 

This claim is partially true. mRNA and DNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine technology that introduce genetic material into cells to stimulate an immune response against a specific disease. They are not made with live or attenuated viruses, as traditional vaccines are. However, they do meet the medical and legal definition of a vaccine, as recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other regulatory bodies. The FDA has classified both mRNA and DNA COVID-19 vaccines as vaccines, and they are subject to the same regulatory standards as other vaccines. Therefore, while mRNA and DNA vaccines may be considered a type of gene therapy, they are also classified as vaccines."	1
COVID-19	1365354194178351104	"There have been over 1,000 deaths in the U.S. from the COVID vaccine and the media is not reporting it while social media is censoring anyone who questions the vaccines at the request of the government, and manufacturers cannot be sued.

This claim is partially false. While it is true that there have been reports of deaths following COVID-19 vaccination, it is important to note that causality has not been established in all cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are monitoring reports of adverse reactions and have not found any evidence linking these deaths to the vaccine. The media also has reported on some of these deaths, though coverage may vary by outlet.

As for social media censorship, platforms like Facebook and Twitter have policies in place to combat misinformation about vaccines, which can include removing posts that share false information or conspiracy theories. However, users can still share their opinions and experiences with the vaccine as long as they do not violate the platform's terms of service.

Regarding manufacturers being sued, the federal government has given immunity to vaccine manufacturers under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act in order to incentivize them to ramp up production and distribution during the pandemic. This immunity is not absolute, and individuals who experience severe adverse reactions to the vaccine can still file a claim through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)."	1
COVID-19	1357055635209269249	False. These are all medical myths and have been debunked by multiple scientific studies and experts.

This claim is misleading and false. There is no evidence that the International Criminal Court has filed a case against Israel under the Nuremberg Code for forcing Jews to test vaccines. The Nuremberg Code was established after World War II to protect individuals from unethical medical experimentation. It is not relevant to the current COVID-19 vaccine rollout, as the vaccine has undergone extensive clinical trials and been approved by regulatory agencies. Vaccination is not being forced upon anyone, and individuals have the right to choose whether or not to be vaccinated."	1

These numbers are continuously updated and do not represent a definitive causal link between the vaccines and reported adverse events. 

As for the deaths in South Korea, it has been reported that two people died after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine, but the cause of death has not been confirmed and investigations are ongoing. It is important to note that adverse events, including deaths, can occur following any type of vaccine, but are rare and often due to unrelated factors. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death far outweigh the risks."	1

The report included data up to March 26, 2021 and showed a total of 2,342 deaths reported to VAERS after COVID-19 vaccinations, with 259 of those deaths reported in the previous week. However, it is important to note that the VAERS system relies on self-reporting and does not establish a causal relationship between the vaccine and reported adverse events. The overwhelming majority of individuals who receive COVID vaccines experience only mild side effects, and the vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in large clinical trials."	1

Regarding the statement ""Kerala is the only state in India, which successfully stopped 3 deadly virus, Corona, Nipah and BJP,"" it is false and misleading.

Firstly, BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is a political party and not a virus. It is incorrect to include it in the list of deadly viruses.

Secondly, while Kerala has been appreciated for its efforts in managing and controlling the spread of COVID-19, it is not the only state in India that has successfully tackled the virus. Several other states, such as Goa, Mizoram, and Sikkim, have also reported low numbers of COVID-19 cases.

Lastly, Nipah virus outbreak occurred in Kerala in 2018, and while it was a serious health concern, the virus was eventually contained and eliminated. However, it is not correct to claim that Kerala is the only state in India that has successfully stopped Nipah virus.

In conclusion, the claim that Kerala is the only state in India that successfully stopped three deadly viruses- Corona, Nipah, and BJP- is incorrect and misleading."	1

It is also possible that some of the people who came in contact with the CPAC attendee may not be showing symptoms yet and a test may not be accurate if taken too soon. Additionally, self-quarantine is a precautionary measure that can help prevent the potential spread of the virus.
