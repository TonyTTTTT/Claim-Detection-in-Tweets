This claim appears to be based on President Biden's recent announcement that his administration has secured enough vaccine doses to inoculate all American adults by the end of May, two months ahead of schedule. While this is an ambitious goal, it remains to be seen how quickly and efficiently the vaccines will be distributed and administered across the country. Some experts have expressed concerns about potential bottlenecks and logistical challenges in the vaccine rollout, especially as new variants of the virus emerge and vaccine hesitancy persists in some communities. It's possible that some drug stores or clinics may start offering walk-in appointments or expanded hours as more doses become available, but it's also possible that appointments will still be required in some areas or for certain populations. Ultimately, the speed and success of the vaccination campaign will depend on multiple factors, including public health messaging, community outreach, and vaccine supply and distribution efforts."	0

Insurance companies are required to cover the cost of the COVID-19 vaccine under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The federal government has also established a fund to cover any costs related to adverse events resulting from vaccination.

Moreover, regulatory agencies like the FDA and CDC closely monitor the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and investigate any reports of adverse reactions. They also provide transparent and up-to-date information to healthcare professionals and the public to ensure that the benefits of the vaccines outweigh the potential risks.

The extent of vaccine production and distribution will depend on various factors such as supply chain readiness, regulatory approvals, and production capacity. Additionally, there has been scepticism and concerns over the efficacy and safety of some of India's Covid-19 vaccines, particularly the Covishield vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and produced by the Serum Institute of India.

The CDC VAERS system is a passive reporting system, meaning that anyone can report an adverse event following vaccination, regardless of whether or not the event was actually caused by the vaccine. Therefore, it is important to note that not all adverse events reported to VAERS are necessarily caused by the vaccine. Additionally, the report only shows raw data and does not provide a detailed analysis of the reported adverse events. 

However, it is true that the latest VAERS report shows 1,265 deaths and 4,424 serious injuries reported following Covid-19 vaccination. It is also true that 47% of reported deaths occurred within 48 hours of vaccination, although this does not necessarily prove that the vaccine caused the deaths. It is important to note that the overwhelming majority of people who receive the Covid-19 vaccine do not experience any serious adverse effects. The CDC and FDA continue to monitor the safety of the Covid-19 vaccines and recommend their use."	1

In rare cases, there have been reports of adverse reactions to the vaccine, such as anaphylaxis, but these are far outweighed by the benefits of vaccination in preventing severe illness and death from Covid-19.

This claim is partially true but misleading. 

It is true that President Biden announced on January 12, 2021, that his administration would release all available doses of the COVID-19 vaccine instead of holding back second doses for people who already received their first. However, the claim that there was suddenly no reserved vaccine is false. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that second doses are guaranteed and that they are tracking vaccine allocation and distribution to ensure that second doses are available. The decision to release all available doses was based on the fact that production was increasing and there was confidence that manufacturers could provide enough doses for both first and second shots. 

Additionally, the tweet suggests that Biden's decision led to the missing vaccine, but there is no evidence to support this claim. It is also important to note that the article linked in the tweet is an opinion piece, not a news article, and should be evaluated with that in mind."	1

This claim is false and has no scientific basis. The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) have been extensively tested in clinical trials and have been shown to be safe and effective for people of all ages, including older adults. In fact, older adults have been prioritized for vaccine distribution in many countries due to their increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.

The mRNA vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been authorized for emergency use by regulatory agencies around the world, including the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. The vaccines have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19, and are an essential tool in controlling the spread of the virus.

COVID-19	1.3698827448897372e+18	"African Presidents are giving millions of dollars to fake vaccines instead of valuing their own drugs and medicine for Covid-19. 

This claim is not entirely accurate. While it is true that some African governments have expressed interest in obtaining Covid-19 vaccines from China and Russia, it does not necessarily mean they are neglecting their own medicine. In fact, many African countries are actively working on developing their own treatments and vaccines for Covid-19.

Additionally, it is important to note that not all vaccines developed outside of Africa are ""fake"" or ineffective. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and approval processes before they are made available to the public. It is unfair and misleading to make blanket statements about the efficacy of vaccines from certain countries without concrete evidence."	1

COVID-19	1.369434166031483e+18	"The claim is partially true, but it lacks important context and clarification. 

It is true that animal trials for mRNA vaccines in 2012 resulted in immune cytokine storm response when they were later exposed to a wild cold virus, which caused some animals to become very sick and die. However, it is not accurate to say that these were the same mRNA vaccines used for COVID-19, as mRNA technology has significantly advanced in the past decade. 

Furthermore, it is important to note that the animal trials conducted for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines involved rigorous testing and safety protocols before human trials were conducted. The vaccines also went through extensive clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people before receiving emergency use authorization from regulatory agencies.

Therefore, it is not accurate to make a direct comparison between the animal trials from 2012 and the current COVID-19 vaccines. While there may be some potential side effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccines, they have been shown to be highly effective and safe for the vast majority of people who receive them."	1

These studies are expected to continue well beyond the end of 2022.

This claim is partially true. mRNA and DNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine technology that introduce genetic material into cells to stimulate an immune response against a specific disease. They are not made with live or attenuated viruses, as traditional vaccines are. However, they do meet the medical and legal definition of a vaccine, as recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other regulatory bodies.

This claim is partially false. While it is true that there have been reports of deaths following COVID-19 vaccination, it is important to note that causality has not been established in all cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are monitoring reports of adverse reactions and have not found any evidence linking these deaths to the vaccine. The media also has reported on some of these deaths, though coverage may vary by outlet.

As for social media censorship, platforms like Facebook and Twitter have policies in place to combat misinformation about vaccines, which can include removing posts that share false information or conspiracy theories. However, users can still share their opinions and experiences with the vaccine as long as they do not violate the platform's terms of service.

Regarding manufacturers being sued, the federal government has given immunity to vaccine manufacturers under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act in order to incentivize them to ramp up production and distribution during the pandemic. This immunity is not absolute, and individuals who experience severe adverse reactions to the vaccine can still file a claim through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)."	1

The COVID-19 vaccines have gone through rigorous testing and have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing the disease. The vaccines do not alter DNA or cause COVID-19 disease. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines will affect fertility. Vaccines have been developed for various diseases in a short amount of time before, and the speed of vaccine development for COVID-19 was due to the unprecedented global effort and investment in research and development.	1

South Africa and India have proposed to the World Trade Organization (WTO) a waiver on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, which would allow for the temporary suspension of intellectual property rights related to Covid-19 vaccines and other medical products. The proposal aims to ensure that these essential products are more widely available to low- and middle-income countries that may not have the resources to produce them on their own. The waiver has been supported by over 100 countries, while some richer nations, including the United States, have expressed opposition.	0

This claim is misleading and false. There is no evidence that the International Criminal Court has filed a case against Israel under the Nuremberg Code for forcing Jews to test vaccines. The Nuremberg Code was established after World War II to protect individuals from unethical medical experimentation. It is not relevant to the current COVID-19 vaccine rollout, as the vaccine has undergone extensive clinical trials and been approved by regulatory agencies. Vaccination is not being forced upon anyone, and individuals have the right to choose whether or not to be vaccinated."	1
COVID-19	1.370678605441765e+18	"The claim is that there are 5,000 new COVID-19 cases in the Philippines and that the country has received donated vaccines despite taking out ₱10 trillion in COVID-19 loans. The claim also refers to a new strain of the virus, dubbed the ""DU30 Covid-19 strain,"" which is allegedly due to the strategies implemented by the government's Inter-Agency Task Force and the appointed officials in charge of testing, tracing, isolation, vaccination, and treatment efforts."	0
COVID-19	1.3706572633969172e+18	"508 people have died and 297,274 have been injured following COVID-19 experimental vaccines in the UK. 

There is no evidence to support this claim. The UK government's Yellow Card scheme, which monitors and reports suspected side effects of medicines and vaccines, has reported a total of 332 deaths and 21,032 adverse reactions (not necessarily injuries) following COVID-19 vaccines as of March 17, 2021. These numbers are continuously updated and do not represent a definitive causal link between the vaccines and reported adverse events. 

As for the deaths in South Korea, it has been reported that two people died after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine, but the cause of death has not been confirmed and investigations are ongoing. It is important to note that adverse events, including deaths, can occur following any type of vaccine, but are rare and often due to unrelated factors. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death far outweigh the risks."	1
COVID-19	1.3706536959317893e+18	"The CDC has reported 259 deaths after COVID vaccines in one week. 

This is true based on the report from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) released by the CDC on April 2, 2021. The report included data up to March 26, 2021 and showed a total of 2,342 deaths reported to VAERS after COVID-19 vaccinations, with 259 of those deaths reported in the previous week. However, it is important to note that the VAERS system relies on self-reporting and does not establish a causal relationship between the vaccine and reported adverse events. The overwhelming majority of individuals who receive COVID vaccines experience only mild side effects, and the vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in large clinical trials."	1

Regarding the statement ""Kerala is the only state in India, which successfully stopped 3 deadly virus, Corona, Nipah and BJP,"" it is false and misleading.

Firstly, BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is a political party and not a virus. It is incorrect to include it in the list of deadly viruses.

Secondly, while Kerala has been appreciated for its efforts in managing and controlling the spread of COVID-19, it is not the only state in India that has successfully tackled the virus. Several other states, such as Goa, Mizoram, and Sikkim, have also reported low numbers of COVID-19 cases.

Lastly, Nipah virus outbreak occurred in Kerala in 2018, and while it was a serious health concern, the virus was eventually contained and eliminated. However, it is not correct to claim that Kerala is the only state in India that has successfully stopped Nipah virus.

In conclusion, the claim that Kerala is the only state in India that successfully stopped three deadly viruses- Corona, Nipah, and BJP- is incorrect and misleading."	1

This has been a common practice for Trump since he took office, with previous donations going to various government agencies and programs.
