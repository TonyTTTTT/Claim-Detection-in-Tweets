COVID-19	1370196168945242114	When Joe Biden was inaugurated, the United States had already given out 1.5 million COVID-19 vaccines. Biden was not responsible for this achievement, and Donald Trump accurately predicted during a debate that the vaccines would be available by the middle or end of 2020. Trump was right once again.	1

COVID-19	1369295089466363904	@AirshipGirl @donwinslow It's not just the anti-maskers who are causing issues. While there's been a decrease in vaccine reluctance among minorities, Republicans are still not getting vaccinated. The Trump administration's downplaying of the virus has not only led to a failure in managing the pandemic but also preventing herd immunity through vaccinations. The result is increased deaths.	0

COVID-19	1371004539931922436	Pro-establishment newspapers are not only justifying the suppression of dissenting opinions this Sunday, but they are also distorting the use of vaccines as a tool of exploitation reminiscent of colonialism.

COVID-19	1370901575355490305	There are factual pieces of information about vaccines that do not involve any conspiracy theory, which are as follows: Firstly, the duration of the immunity a Covid vaccine provides is currently unknown.
