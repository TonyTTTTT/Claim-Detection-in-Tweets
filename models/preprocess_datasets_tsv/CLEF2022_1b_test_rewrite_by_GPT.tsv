COVID-19	1429782309587144705	The notion that the vaccines were unexpected is a consequence of insufficient communication of scientific information, which has resulted in unfortunate outcomes. The vaccines are, in fact, the culmination of several decades of fundamental research in numerous domains, leveraging the extensive scope and depth of human understanding. Such is the scientific process, and it is truly astonishing.	1
COVID-19	1445778603329740800	Big News: The WHO has given the green light to the first-ever malaria vaccine.

COVID-19	1366886987484061697	The actions of Governor Abbott are akin to issuing a death sentence for the people of Texas. His failure to effectively address the pandemic and mishandling of vaccine distribution have resulted in over 44,000 fatalities. In addition, his prioritization of energy companies' profits above the well-being of his constituents has led to avoidable deaths due to freezing temperatures. Governor Abbott's policies are actively causing harm to the people of Texas.	1
COVID-19	1414721600537206790	Many people argue that vaccines are unnatural, but so are numerous other things we use in our daily lives, such as glasses, airplanes, anesthesia, scuba gear, AC units, filtered water, bullets, televisions, microwaves, and shoes.	1

COVID-19	1338657584685993986	An mRNA vaccine does not contain the actual virus, but rather serves as a message sent to the immune system detailing the virus's appearance, how to eliminate it, and then vanishing like a Snapchat message. The technology is truly incredible.	1

COVID-19	1475442806021840899	The purpose of the booster shot was not to alleviate symptoms; rather, it aimed to sustain the fallacy that the vaccine was capable of preventing individuals from both acquiring and transmitting COVID.

Mandating vaccinations for air travel should be seen as the bare minimum in our efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19.	0
COVID-19	1432379991870910465	I am addressing all the reporters who spoke to me disrespectfully about natural immunity using Fauci's statements while we were in Congress.
