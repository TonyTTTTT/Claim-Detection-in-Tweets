COVID-19	1370901575355490305	"Here are two possible ways to make the article more understandable:

Simplified Version:
There are two things we know about COVID-19 vaccines. First, we don't know how long they will protect our bodies from the virus. Second, a vaccine made by AstraZeneca has been banned by some countries like Denmark, Norway, and Thailand because of concerns about its safety.

Expanded Version:
There is still much we don't know about COVID-19 vaccines, but here are two important things that scientists and health officials have been paying attention to:
1. The duration of immunity: While vaccines have been shown to be effective in preventing COVID-19 in many cases, it's unclear how long this protection will last. Some studies suggest that immunity may wane over time, which means that people may need booster shots or re-vaccination in the future. However, more research is needed to determine the exact length and durability of vaccine-induced immunity.
2. Safety concerns about AstraZeneca: One of the approved COVID-19 vaccines, made by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, has faced scrutiny and restrictions in some countries. Denmark, Norway, and Thailand are among the nations that have paused or suspended the use of this vaccine due to reports of blood clotting disorders in a small number of people who received it. While the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization have both concluded that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, officials are continuing to monitor the situation and investigate any potential links between the vaccine and rare adverse effects."	1
