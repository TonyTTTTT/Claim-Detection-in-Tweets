COVID-19	1370421107929591810	"This claim is misleading and lacks context. While it is true that there have been more reports of side effects and deaths following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), this does not necessarily mean that the vaccines are less safe than other vaccines. 

Firstly, VAERS is a self-reporting system, so not all adverse events associated with vaccines are reported. It is also important to note that VAERS reports are not verified or investigated to determine causality. 

Furthermore, the COVID-19 vaccines have been administered on a much larger scale than other vaccines in the last year, so it is not unexpected that there may be more reports of adverse events. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of October 11, 2021, more than 460 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States alone. 

It is also important to emphasize that the benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 far outweigh the risks of adverse events. COVID-19 continues to cause severe illness, hospitalization, and deaths, particularly in unvaccinated individuals. The vaccines have been shown to be highly effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death, and have undergone rigorous testing and monitoring for safety."	1

The strategy involves negotiating with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of all member states to secure vaccines at a fair price, rather than allowing individual member states to negotiate separately, which could lead to inequities in vaccine distribution. Ireland has also been administering vaccines as they become available, with the aim of vaccinating its population as quickly as possible."	0
