COVID-19	1339624815137722368	The mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna are innovative in the way they use genetic material to trigger an immune response in the body. Essentially, the vaccine contains a small piece of genetic code called messenger RNA (mRNA) that provides instructions for making a piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus called the spike protein. When the vaccine is injected into the body, the mRNA enters cells and instructs them to make the spike protein. The immune system recognizes the spike protein as foreign and produces antibodies to fight it. If the person is later exposed to the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus, their immune system is primed and ready to fight it off. This approach is different from traditional vaccines, which typically use weakened or dead viruses to stimulate the immune system. The mRNA vaccines do not contain live virus and cannot give someone COVID-19. Overall, the mRNA vaccines have shown to be highly effective in clinical trials and have the potential to be used in the development of future vaccines.	0
COVID-19	1239704749232005121	The idea that COVID-19 will go away in summer months is a myth, as previous pandemics have not followed weather patterns.

COVID-19	1338657584685993986	mRNA vaccines are not like traditional vaccines that contain the virus itself. Instead, they send a message to the immune system that provides instructions on how to identify and destroy the virus. It is like receiving an email or a Snapchat message that shows what the virus looks like and how to fight it.

COVID-19	1379283424356225030	Vaccines were the key factor in eradicating polio and smallpox, even though herd immunity was never achieved for these diseases. Herd immunity implies that a significant proportion of individuals are immune to a disease, either through vaccination or prior infection, reducing its transmission and protecting the entire population.
