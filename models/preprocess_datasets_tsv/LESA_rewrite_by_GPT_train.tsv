LESA	-1	The coronavirus in China can be summarized in a few key points: it was allegedly created in a laboratory in Wuhan, and the animal market was used as a cover-up for its origins.

LESA	-1	It is disheartening to recall the past when the Chinese Communist Party would gather and sell organs such as lungs, eyes, hearts, and livers from prisoners and lawbreakers in their wet markets. However, the current situation is even more distressing as China's medicine is now being used to commit mass murder and genocide against the United States and the rest of the world through the Wuhan400 War bioweapon CoronaVirus, also known as COVID-19. This is a tragic reality.	1

LESA	-1	@g_gosden It seems that we are on our own in this fight against COVID-19. The government has let us down and I am treating this virus as if it were the plague, capable of attaching itself to anything and spreading through the air. Simply washing our hands is not enough.

LESA	-1	A scientist of Asian descent was conducting experiments in a bio lab, attempting to combine different strains of coronavirus in a controlled environment. Through a process of careful selection, he discovered a highly contagious and deadly strain that was uniquely adapted to his own biology. Tragically, he ultimately succumbed to the virus and lost his life.	1
LESA	-1	The truth about the coronavirus is that it is both contagious and deadly, and it originated in Wuhan, China. However, there are two conflicting theories about where it came from: some believe it was created in a sophisticated bioweapons lab in Wuhan, while others think it may have started from someone eating a snake in a market in Wuhan. It's hard to say for sure which is true, but it's an important question to ask.	1

I am writing to express my concern about the use of disinfectant chemicals in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is important to take measures to prevent the spread of the virus, we must also consider the potential harm to our health and the environment.

I believe that the cure for the coronavirus cannot be worse than the problem itself. We must prioritize both our health and the sustainability of our planet. It is crucial that we find innovative solutions that are ethical and do not cause further harm.

I urge everyone to consider the long-term effects of their actions and to work towards a sustainable and healthy future for all.
