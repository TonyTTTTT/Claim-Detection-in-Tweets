Dear Employer,

I am writing to express my concern regarding the Covid-19 vaccine and the prospect of mandatory vaccine passports in the workplace.

As an individual, it is my fundamental right to make my own health decisions, including whether or not to be vaccinated against any illness. While I believe in the importance of public health and safety, I also value the autonomy of my body and personal medical choices.

The decision to decline the Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine passport is not based on any personal interests or beliefs. It is a matter of my personal choice and my right to medical privacy. Therefore, I must respectfully decline any requirement to take the vaccine or produce a vaccine passport as a condition of my employment.

I understand that employers have a responsibility to take measures that ensure the safety and well-being of employees and customers, but I believe that there are alternative ways to achieve this without infringing on individual rights.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]"	0
