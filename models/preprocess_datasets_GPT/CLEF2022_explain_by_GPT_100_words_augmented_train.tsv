COVID-19	1.237107071947948e+18	The article refers to the recent Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) attendee who tested positive for COVID-19. The concern is why the people who came in contact with the infected attendee are doing self-quarantine instead of getting a coronavirus test. The reason for this is because the coronavirus test may not necessarily detect the virus in the early stages of infection when the person may not yet be showing symptoms. Therefore, self-quarantine is an important precautionary measure to prevent the potential spread of the virus. It is also important for individuals to monitor their symptoms and seek medical attention if necessary, even if they test negative for COVID-19.	0
