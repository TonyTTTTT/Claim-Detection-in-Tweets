LESA	2151	It should be common sense, but apparently it's not. I'm sharing this in case you're a #COVIDIOT who believes that consuming or injecting #lysol can eliminate the #COVID19 virus. https://t.co/OypxV52zrK	1

LESA	2154	The number of deaths caused by the regular flu every year is higher than the number of deaths caused by the coronavirus. It is important to practice good hygiene, such as washing your hands and covering your mouth when coughing, and taking vitamins.

LESA	2155	Does the absence of travel restrictions imply that South Africans are not susceptible to the coronavirus? If not, what is the rationale behind not imposing travel restrictions to and from China to safeguard our citizens?	1
LESA	2156	@trevormundel, did you inquire about the presence of several CCP spies in his vicinity and how he failed to notice them? These spies were frequently traveling to Wuhan with our bio weapons. It is believed that #xiangguoqiu stole the virus from the P4 lab in Canada and brought it to Wuhan, leading to the outbreak of #coronavirus or #CCPvirus. The information about this is well-known. https://t.co/rthsCHAA2f	1
LESA	2157	It appears that China emerged victorious in the biowarfare involving COVID-19. There are speculations that the Wuhan virus was intentionally developed in a Chinese laboratory to target the United States. The National Security Agency's findings may shed light on this matter.	1
LESA	2158	"According to James Rickards, the origin of COVID-19 can be traced back to a Chinese biowarfare lab. He also warns that Putin and Xi are working together, with Putin's desire to become a global superpower driving their partnership.

LESA	2163	Spock, you are going to find a cure for the coronavirus.	1
LESA	2164	There are several falsehoods circulating about #COVID19, such as the belief that taking a hot bath can prevent the virus or that eating garlic can protect you from it.

LESA	2165	When you vote in the presidential election this November, remember that you have a choice between @JoeBiden and a candidate who once proposed injecting Lysol as a potential cure for the #coronavirus. It's a clear binary choice.	1
LESA	2166	Those who consume finger food while bowling possess immunity against the corona virus.	1
LESA	2167	It is necessary for @MEAIndia, @DrSJaishankar, @narendramodi, @PMOIndia, and @rashtrapatibhvn to urge the @UN, @UNGeneva, and @UNHumanRights Security Council to impose economic sanctions on @MFA_China for their production of biowar weapons.

Many are concerned about his recent comments on disinfectant injection and believe that #TrumpIsA_DANGER_ToAmerica. There are calls to #RemoveTrumpNow as some fear that he is trying to harm Americans.	1
LESA	2171	The deadly new virus known as Corona currently has no cure. In order to adhere to the health advisory issued by the central health ministry to prevent the spread of the disease, the Gurugram Marathon 2020 has been cancelled to promote social distancing.

LESA	2178	It has been reported that Christine Blasey Ford's brother, Thomas Blasey, worked with Jill Strzok, who is married to Peter Strzok. This information was not brought up during yesterday's proceedings. If this is true, it could be a significant factor in confirming Brett Kavanaugh.	1

LESA	2183	It is not advisable to take a heavy dose of HydroxyCholoroquine as it can be dangerous. However, individuals can consider trying preventive homeopathic or immune-boosting Ayurvedic remedies such as GILOY/guloncho juice and Papaya leaf juice. It should be noted that these remedies are not meant to cure coronavirus but may provide some benefits.	1
LESA	2184	I may be facing some trouble as I relied on @LFPress horoscope to plan my day. However, it advised me to stay away from unpredictable and unrealistic individuals, which means I won't be paying attention to @realDonaldTrump. His suggestion of injecting disinfectants to cure #Covid_19 is extremely hazardous and foolish.	1
LESA	2185	The symptoms of our sin condition are far worse than those of Covid-19. Eventually, every human being will succumb to this condition. However, there is a cure - redemption through Jesus Christ. Those who accept this cure will recover, while those who reject it will die without hope. The destination for each group is vastly different.	1

LESA	2187	Donnie, who is known for his intelligence, stops Dr. Fauci from responding to inquiries about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine against the coronavirus.

LESA	2193	"It is advised not to consume hydroxychloroquine, the drug being promoted by the White House as a potential cure for COVID-19. Despite being touted as a ""miracle"" drug, it can lead to psychosis and even death. Furthermore, there is no concrete evidence to support its effectiveness against the virus. It wouldn't be surprising if it is discovered that Trump has invested in the company that produces the drug."	1
LESA	2194	The Atlantic reports that young individuals are not invulnerable to the coronavirus, despite popular belief. This is particularly relevant in New York City, where many young people have been infected. Read more at the link: https://t.co/C3e3SfHPVV.	1

This is a serious case of voter fraud, as every illegal vote takes away the voice of American citizens.	1

LESA	2203	Amazon is puzzled as to why Alexa is laughing at seemingly random times, leading to concerns about a potential AI takeover. Jennifer Epstein shared this news on Twitter.	1
LESA	2204	It's quite convenient that Chloroquine is now able to cure Q fever, as reported by @X22Report. It's also interesting to note that Madonna and Hanks are using Corona typewriters.

LESA	2210	Thank you, Michael Bloomberg, for providing an unintentional demonstration on how to spread coronavirus.

LESA	2211	Dear President Trump, I would like to inform you that there are safe disinfectants for consumption and natural ones for cleaning fruits, which are important to rinse to remove any traces of coronavirus.

LESA	2215	Even N95 masks do not provide complete protection against the coronavirus. They only prevent the wearer from infecting others if they are positive. If some people are wearing masks and others are not, the chances of the positive non-wearers infecting the wearers are higher.	1
LESA	2216	An early trial of a possible Covid-19 vaccine created by a leading military virologist in China has yielded positive results, as it has triggered an immune system response in more than one hundred healthy adults. The Lancet published the study on Friday.	1

LESA	2219	The African Ebola outbreak, MERS, SARS, Swine Flu outbreaks in China, and now the Corona outbreak, which is only 20 miles away from the Wuhan lab that allegedly obtained the deadly bio-weapon from Canada, which was later isolated by a Dutch lab.

LESA	2224	There has been a potential breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19 as a vaccine has been developed and tested on approximately 190 individuals. The results of the Phase 1 trials indicate that the vaccine is safe for use. The study focused on the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in a non-randomized, first-in-human trial. More information can be found at the provided link.	1
LESA	2225	The suggestion made by Trump about injecting ourselves with disinfectant as a cure for #COVID19 is not only immature and ignorant, but also incredibly foolish.	1

LESA	2227	It is quite thrilling to observe individuals with symbols of crosses and American flags in their usernames engaging in a heated debate regarding the origins and severity of the Coronavirus. Some argue that it is a form of biowarfare that is spreading rapidly and causing more fatalities than what is being reported, while others claim that it is a fabrication created by the Chinese and Obama administration as a psychological operation.	1
LESA	2228	I would welcome it if it prevents an irresponsible person from getting infected with the #Coronavirus and helps save lives.	1

LESA	2231	A man in Incheon, located west of Seoul, who was diagnosed with coronavirus has meticulously recorded his symptoms and daily activities for the past 25 days. He has documented his experiences in 38 pages of remarkable detail, including wearing masks and gloves at home. Despite being in close contact with 23 individuals, all of whom have tested negative for the virus.	1
LESA	2232	"ResisterSis20 asks, ""What could be more insane than suggesting people drink or inject disinfectant to cure Covid-19?"" This is reminiscent of DonnyDeath attempting to imitate Jim Jones and the Jonestown tragedy. However, even poison Kool-Aid would be preferable to bleach. We must remove the madman from power."	1
LESA	2233	The Democrats are hoping for a market crash and will exploit the coronavirus to create more turmoil. They may employ social media trolls and increase media hype to fabricate a crisis. However, defeating Trump in the 2020 election seems unlikely as he will likely crush them in November.	1
LESA	2234	Premnsikka and Kaiserdoc, it seems that there are no plans to address the issue at hand. As a result, patients may succumb to pneumonia instead of Covid-19, as indicated by the death certificates. It appears that they will feign control over the pandemic, and even BBC News may concur with this notion.	1

LESA	2236	Representative Fred Doucette tweeted that President Trump cancelled Speaker Pelosi's planned trips to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan, which included her children and grandchildren, along with seven other congressmen and 93 family members.

LESA	2245	Having used a porta potty at Riot Fest means you are immune to coronavirus.	1
LESA	2246	Why aren't we promoting the importance of getting flu and pneumonia vaccinations? These shots can prevent viruses like the flu and potentially even the coronavirus from infecting the lungs.

LESA	2247	Those who have been in close proximity with juggalos at a juggalo concert are said to have developed immunity to the coronavirus.	1
LESA	2248	It seems that @jkenney's focus is solely on oil, with little attention given to the pandemic. Perhaps he believes that oil is the solution to #Covid19.	1
LESA	2249	"The Daishan Dao in China is known for its shiny lead-based paint, which is used to transport faulty medical equipment and as a mobile laboratory for biological weapons. Despite this, it is referred to as ""The Peace Ark"" by the New York Times. This is in contrast to the USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy, which are currently being used to combat the coronavirus."	1
LESA	2250	According to recent reports, the case-fatality rate for coronavirus is 3.4%. This is higher than the case-fatality rate of 2.5% for the 1918 Spanish flu, which caused the death of 50 million people worldwide when the global population was 1.9 billion. In comparison, the case-fatality rate for the usual seasonal flu is only 0.1%.

LESA	2257	@Mc_ahmanny @R6Noob_ @Tonlee01, the CCP did not address the concerns of the people, which led to mass protests before the coronavirus outbreak. The protests stopped after the virus spread from a Chinese biolab, which seems like a coincidence. It is evident that the CCP is evil.	1

LESA	2267	Dear doctors worldwide, I recently came across information suggesting that venous microthrombosis, rather than interstitial pneumonia, may be the cause of death in cases of Coronavirus.

LESA	2286	The current administration is engaging in a deceitful and unfair practice, akin to a rigged game of three-card monte.

LESA	2339	Dear @realDonaldTrump, I believe the reason why it's important to block everything from China, including people, is because this virus is a tool of biowarfare.

I hope you understand the severity of this situation. Thank you.	1
