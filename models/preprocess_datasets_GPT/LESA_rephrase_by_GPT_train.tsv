LESA	0	If you have visited White Caps, you are resistant to the coronavirus.	1
LESA	1	It is not true that bleach can cure COVID-19. The coronavirus cannot be eliminated from your body by disinfectants, and using them can actually harm you. If you or someone you know has come into contact with bleach, seek assistance from Poison Control by calling 1-800-222-1222.	1
LESA	2	The government of Botswana has issued a statement denouncing the comments made by President Trump.

A photo of the statement was also attached to the tweet.	1

LESA	8	Although the video shows Cape Town, the tornado depicted in it is not local and was added through CGI. It actually originates from Texas. This was pointed out by RyGuySA on June 7, 2017.	1
LESA	9	The US government, with the help of the CIA, is believed to have deliberately caused the epidemic in China. This highlights the fact that the US is a global threat. It is important to remember the use of bio weapons by the US during the Vietnam War.	1
LESA	10	The world is facing a problem due to conspiracy theorists who claim that the corona virus is not real.	1
LESA	11	At the age of 13, @natilight77 successfully schooled @ESPN, along with @JohnnySins, @JillKassidyy, @nataliaxstarr, and @lissapolooza. They have a winning picture to prove it.	1
LESA	12	According to my students, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that any perceived honorary white status given to Asians in the US was never permanent.	1
LESA	13	Using bleach as a suppository is not an effective cure for COVID-19, just like inhaling Lysol is not any better.	1
LESA	14	The claim made by @Lace22Leather is that the coronavirus is not real and is being used as a tactic to frighten people into not voting.	1
LESA	15	It's time to resume work as those who have recuperated from COVID-19 are now immune.	1
LESA	16	It has come to my attention that your administration was informed about the COVID-19 outbreak in January, yet it is now March and there is still a severe shortage of test kits. This is unacceptable and a failure to fulfill your duty. Please stop downplaying the seriousness of the situation and take action to protect lives that are at risk. Here is a link for more information.	1

However, the Prime Minister took Pike's phone and put it in his pocket.	1
LESA	20	An E. Coli O157:H7 outbreak is currently occurring, causing symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, vomiting blood, and kidney failure. This outbreak is a result of Trump's decision to reverse Obama-era regulations that required farm water to be tested. Although farmers saved $12 million, the medical costs for those affected by the outbreak will cost $108 million. This information was shared by Eugene Gu, MD on November 25, 2018.	1
LESA	21	The spread of coronavirus can be prevented by using hand sanitizer and washing hands.	1
LESA	22	Don't worry, it's probably just pneumonia or symptoms similar to pneumonia. There's no need to be concerned about it being Coronavirus. Keep going about your day and don't pay it too much attention. It's just symptoms that resemble pneumonia.	1
LESA	23	Mr. President, didn't you suggest that drinking bleach or taking unapproved medication could be a cure for COVID-19? Your dangerous and uninformed statements make it clear that the best way to stay safe is to ignore your advice. TrumpIsNotADoctor and COVID-19 are serious issues that require informed and responsible leadership.	1
LESA	24	Have you ever had the thought that the cure for COVID-19 could be a combination of Lysol, Ajax, ginger, and bananas, and that Trump is a danger to America and must be removed from office in November because he is unfit?	1
LESA	25	Barbara Taylor tweeted at Michael Kors and Women for Women UK, asking if it is true that their bags are made from dog hides obtained through cruel means in China. She expressed her concern and stated that she would have to get rid of her bag if this is true.	1
LESA	26	Is the behavior of young conservatives towards Trump a form of trolling or simply a display of ignorance? During his speech at Turning Point, Trump was presented with a fake presidential seal that featured the Russian Coat of Arms and golf clubs, which was meant to highlight his affinity for Putin and his frequent golfing trips that have taken up 30% of his term. Bryan Dawson (@BryanDawsonUSA) shared this incident on Twitter.	1
LESA	27	The cure for Covid 19 is Hydrochloroquine, but the FakeNews media controlled by Democrats is hiding this information from the public.	1
LESA	28	Kim, the timeline is visible, but the question is what significance it holds. Consider the involvement of China and the World Bank in Event 201, as well as the connections between Wuhan's bioweapons research and the West. Should we blame China or the US? Sometimes nations are merely pawns. Who benefits from all of this?	1
LESA	29	Perhaps COVID-19 could be the solution to stupidity, rather than the problem.	1
LESA	30	It should be noted that this is the same nation that suppresses and weakens the treatments for AIDS and cancer, only to charge you for an inadequate supplementary drug. Therefore, it is unlikely that the coronavirus will ever be eradicated. This is a government cover-up. Happy Easter, CNN. #GoodFriday2020 #coronavirus #pharmaceuticals	1
LESA	31	It is indeed @DarrellIssa on the rooftop of his district office building, too scared to address the gathered constituents below, as captured in a tweet by @MikeLevinCA on May 30, 2017.	1
LESA	32	"Trump has proposed a ""cure"" for Covid-19 that involves injecting disinfectant, which he claims would eliminate the disease. However, this method would also be extremely deadly. It is truly remarkable."	1
LESA	33	Although a person can die from the common flu virus even with a fully functioning immune system, some people believe that the new Coronavirus is not as deadly as the flu.	1
LESA	34	Amidst a worldwide health crisis, this individual seems to be indulging in self-centered behavior (possibly due to the influence of cocaine).	1
LESA	35	Could it be possible that the illness in question is actually diphtheria, which can present with similar symptoms? I recently watched a movie about Balto and Togo, and the similarities are striking. It's important to note that people can carry diphtheria without realizing it, just like with coronavirus. I hope the CDC is working towards finding a cure for both.	1
LESA	36	Based on theories and movies, I believe that a potential cure for COVID-19 could be derived from a baby born to a woman who previously had the virus and recovered. The child may have immunity to the virus, which could be used to develop a cure for the general population. This is my opinion on PJnet 1A.	1
LESA	37	@JSH_cbAffiliate @thehill Please find a remedy for your TDS as it appears to be more severe than COVID-19.	1

LESA	41	The weather forecast for Cape Town's capestorm is unbelievable, as shown in a tweet by RyGuySA on June 7, 2017.	1
LESA	42	It is alleged that Justin Trudeau authorized the transfer of a deadly virus to a Chinese bio weapons laboratory in Wuhan.	1
LESA	43	The DOH has announced that a COVID-19 patient is currently receiving treatment at Medical City Pasig. Additionally, a Pasig resident who has contracted the virus is being treated at a private hospital outside of the city. The LGU is working closely with the DOH to manage the situation.	1
LESA	44	"I believe that the communist government of China intentionally spread the virus at a gathering attended by military personnel from 109 countries as an act of biological warfare. This pandemic caused by the CCP virus, also known as COVID-19, is a serious issue and we should all stay at home to prevent its spread. Let's stand together as a nation with the motto ""Where We Go One, We Go All"" (WWG 1WGA). 🇺 🇸"	1
LESA	45	In an early-stage clinical trial, a possible coronavirus vaccine created by CanSino Biologic in China (Ad5-nCoV) has been found to stimulate neutralizing antibodies in numerous patients, potentially offering protection against SARSCoV-2 and COVID-19.	1
LESA	46	It is only fair to reject any vaccine or cure created by a Straight White Male until a more diverse individual discovers one.	1
LESA	47	Dr. Sankaran, a homeopath, has successfully treated Iranian Coronavirus patients using Camphora 1M and 10M. This simple method of prevention and cure is vital, whether through a vaccine or the low-cost option of camphor. Camphor has the power to keep viruses at bay and can rescue lives from respiratory distress.	1
LESA	48	It's important to be cautious around individuals who deny the existence of coronavirus or believe it's no worse than the flu, as they may be more susceptible to contracting the virus.	1
LESA	49	It is important to remember that the bio-weapon laboratory in China was located in Wuhan, where the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak originated.	1
LESA	50	It is not a coincidence that Soros had warned Davos attendees about the US economy's impending disaster before the election, and now the coronavirus outbreak is an ideal situation to cause a market crash.	1
LESA	51	The cure offered by the Healthcrats is turning out to be more harmful than the disease itself due to the lack of preparation for the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. The focus is on flattening the curve.	1
LESA	52	As of today, there are 93,164 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide, with 3,199 deaths. The majority of new cases are from Iran, Italy, and South Korea. While COVID-19 is deadlier than the flu, it does not spread as easily. Containment remains a top priority for Europe and Africa. However, the supply of personal protective equipment is rapidly depleting, and there is a need for an increase in production.	1
LESA	53	I believe that ginger and garlic have the ability to cure almost anything.	1
LESA	54	I am not susceptible to the coronavirus. It cannot affect me in any way.	1
LESA	55	Covid 19 is not a result of a Chinese diet, but rather a deliberate creation of a bioweapon in a laboratory.	1
LESA	56	The number of coronavirus cases has surpassed 1000 with 31 deaths reported, and the virus has now spread to 38 states. Can you please tweet about two things: 1) When can we expect to have enough test kits available? 2) It would be helpful to know if the labs have all the necessary materials.	1
LESA	57	"Jacob Wohl tweeted that Ilhan Omar, the congresswoman Laura Loomer had warned about, wrote a letter requesting ""compassion"" in the sentencing of an ISIS recruit. Wohl believes Omar should resign."	1

LESA	59	Having a can or two of Lysol in your homes can effectively halt the spread of coronavirus.	1
LESA	60	President Trump has shifted his focus to narcotics and away from coronavirus cures and testing, stating that it is important to address drug-related issues. However, many are still questioning the availability of test kits.	1
LESA	61	This individual is believed to be associated with the Deep State, while President Trump's statements are considered truthful. According to him, injecting chlorine bleach can cure COVID-19 and prevent the harmful effects of 5G radiation. Let's make America great again!	1
LESA	62	Injecting Lysol into your veins to kill COVID-19 is not a sensible solution, despite what some may believe. The idea is not supported by reputable news sources and could be dangerous. It's important to follow proper cleaning and disinfecting guidelines to stay safe during the pandemic.	1
LESA	63	The World Health Organization has stated that there is no proof that individuals who have recovered from coronavirus are immune to the disease and cannot transmit it to others.	1

LESA	69	Seriously, the cure for this coronavirus needs to be found as soon as possible.	1
LESA	70	In the land abundant with cocaine, the SARSCoV 2 coronavirus is present.	1
LESA	71	Charles Lieber, a Chinese agent, and his virus transmitters have been linked to the integration of the Wuhan virus with electromagnetic pulse technology, suggesting the virus may have been an engineered bioweapon. This information has been reported by GreatGameIndia, who have been investigating the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak.	1
LESA	72	Do you have plans to profit millions from a coronavirus vaccine? Is your Foundation collaborating with a laboratory in Wuhan, China?	1
LESA	73	Seán Mfundza Muller, in an article for The Conversation, argues that the solution to COVID-19 in South Africa may have negative consequences worse than the disease itself.	1
LESA	74	It's true that some individuals believed that cocaine could cure coronavirus. How ridiculous! 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️	1
LESA	75	Stop promoting Fox News and TV doctors, and cease the foolish attempts to compare COVID-19 to non-infectious causes of death. Discontinue the notion that the cure is worse than the disease, and encourage people to stay home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Let's put an end to the stupidity and prioritize testing and contact tracing.	1
LESA	76	It is important to wear face masks and regularly use hand sanitizer to protect yourself from the coronavirus. This virus is airborne and can lead to pneumonia, so please spread this message and stay safe.	1
LESA	77	The world is holding China responsible for the spread of the virus, while China is accusing the USA of using COVID-19 as a bioweapon against them. However, India is being criticized for blaming Muslims for the outbreak, which is seen as a manifestation of their fascist tendencies.	1
LESA	78	Juanita Broaddrick suggests that Susan Rice's complaint about Trump not informing Obama about the killing of the ISIS leader may be due to the fact that Obama was responsible for releasing Baghdadi from prison. Broaddrick also dismisses Rice as irrelevant.	1

LESA	86	If you truly think that injecting bleach into your system can cure Covid 19, feel free to give it a try. It's alarming that Trump is both a dictator and a foolish person.	1
LESA	87	Do not attempt to make lemonade with lemon-scented @Lysol disinfectant wipes if you receive them from life, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.	1
LESA	88	According to a professor, a vaccine that is 90% effective can prevent the spread of the new deadly coronavirus outbreak.

LESA	95	Drinking Clorox will not cure COVID-19, despite what @realDonaldTrump has suggested.	1
LESA	96	Consuming CLOROX in any way does * NOT * provide a cure for COVID 19. In fact, it can be deadly! Please refrain from doing so.	1
LESA	97	"Sage, a plant belonging to the mint family, is renowned for its medicinal properties and is associated with the words ""safe"" and ""cure"".

However, schools are being closed worldwide to prevent the spread of COVID-19, even though it does not pose a significant risk to children.	1
LESA	100	I remember when they used to talk about World War III, Russia, North Korea, and epidemics during every election cycle. It's funny because Lysol, a common product available at the dollar store, lists corona virus as one of the germs it kills, with a 99.9% success rate.	1
LESA	101	What is the reason for the Chinese government allegedly creating a bio weapon for war, which has resulted in the successful spread of Covid-19? This question is directed towards individuals such as @Rakeshrocking86, @ReallySwara, @rose_k01, and @ChinaDaily.	1
LESA	102	It is regrettable that we have lost another life to COVID-19. We should take action to prevent the spread of the virus by practicing self-isolation. It is better to prevent the disease than to treat it.	1
LESA	103	"Suggesting that the Chinese were responsible for starting the ""pandemic"" and falsely accusing the Americans of doing so could potentially escalate into a conflict. The outbreak, known as COVID-19 or Coronavirus, originated in Wuhan, China and has caused widespread illness and quarantine measures. Some have speculated that it may have been caused by a bio-weapon developed in a lab."	1
LESA	104	Lysol was compelled to release a statement due to the suggestion made by @realDonaldTrump about consuming disinfectant as a cure for Covid-19.

LESA	108	If you swam at Sandy Point during your childhood, you are resistant to the Coronavirus.	1
LESA	109	The Slow the Spread initiative is not effectively halting the spread of COVID-19. While there may be a SARS-like disease present, the current approach seems to be more focused on changing behavior rather than finding a cure. Instead of simply avoiding the virus, we need to develop immunity to it. Lockdowns alone will not be enough to eradicate the virus.	1
LESA	110	According to the AP, Germany has over 1100 confirmed cases of coronavirus, but only two deaths so far. Experts believe that the country's early implementation of rapid testing allowed for more accurate diagnoses and gave them the opportunity to contain and prepare for the virus.	1
LESA	111	While it is believed that the vaccine can prevent people from getting COVID-19 and help those in the early stages of the disease, it does not cure it. However, the effectiveness of the vaccine may be limited for those who cannot access testing or afford treatment.	1
LESA	112	The best cure for COVID-19 is to steam yourself.	1
LESA	113	Ozone is effective in eliminating the coronavirus, and ozone generators are an affordable option for disinfecting rooms and buildings.

LESA	114	The manufacturer of Lysol and another disinfectant has advised against using their products as a treatment for the coronavirus internally.	1

Additionally, I learned that Mitt Romney's business partner is involved with Burisma.	1
LESA	116	@abdool_moh @onuohauzo, it's possible that the baby's immune system is strong and fortified with daily vitamins. Since there is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, it's likely that the baby's immune system is fighting off the virus. Let's not attribute everything to a higher power and instead acknowledge the power of the human body.	1
LESA	117	To protect yourself from COVID-19, it is recommended to quit smoking as smokers are at a greater risk of developing severe pneumonia.	1
LESA	118	Be cautious of the coronavirus and the pandemic propaganda being spread by Fox News. Trish Regan's exaggerated tirade accuses Democrats and the mainstream media of using COVID-19 as another means to impeach the president. It is imperative to remove this hazardous individual from the airwaves. This is a Trumpdemic.	1
LESA	119	Has World War 3 started with China's alleged use of the coronavirus as a bio weapon, as tweeted by @pranjultweet to @realDonaldTrump?	1
LESA	120	I believe I have found the vaccine for coronavirus, which is washing your hands, according to a tweet by @bIondiewasabi.	1
LESA	121	Jude has been experiencing the consequences of a false story that circulated on social media after Nigeria's first COVID-19 case was reported.

LESA	126	It's unbelievable that I have to express this, but please refrain from consuming or injecting bleach as a cure for any illness, including COVID-19. There are safer and more effective methods available.	1
LESA	127	Is it true that vaccines can also have potential risks, just like Hydroxychloroquine? The WHO has acknowledged that they do not have a safety profile for vaccines and rely on post-market surveillance for safety assurance. Instead of dismissing Hydroxychloroquine, why not provide indemnity for its use in treating COVID-19, especially since it has been proven to save lives and cure people? This issue should be discussed further with @HighWireTalk.	1

LESA	131	Can you explain how suggesting the injection of bleach as a cure for COVID-19 is helpful in any way?	1
LESA	132	You're welcome, Lysol can kill the coronavirus.	1
LESA	133	There are claims that the virus originated from a bioweapon lab in Wuhan province, where it first emerged. The media's assertion that the virus started at a food market is disputed, as 70% of the initial cases cannot be traced back to it. Additionally, a Chinese spy was apprehended in Canada in 2017 for sending coronavirus samples to the same biolab.	1
LESA	134	In an unprecedented move, China has taken a United States Navy research drone from international waters by forcefully removing it from the water and bringing it to China. President Donald Trump expressed his concern about the incident on Twitter.	1
LESA	135	I will be discussing the cessation of marketing for ineffective COVID-19 treatments and prevention products with Geoff Currier on @680CJOB. Remember to tune out the distractions and consider the validity of information before sharing it.	1

LESA	137	"The saying ""Prevention is better than cure"" holds true, especially in the absence of a cure for COVID-19. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on preventive measures that can enhance our immunity during these challenging times.

It should be noted that FDR passed away while in office in 1945, and the 22nd Amendment was not added until 1947."	1
LESA	143	The infectivity of the influenza virus is impacted by ionizing air, and this also prevents the transmission of airborne coronavirus.	1
LESA	144	I disagree with RufusKings1776. If consuming large amounts of grain alcohol can kill the coronavirus, then Kudlow must be knowledgeable about it.	1
LESA	145	Having a mullet grants immunity to the coronavirus. Hellyeah, brother!	1
LESA	146	Dr. Sanjay Gupta, could the pneumonia vaccine be effective in preventing pneumonia in Covid-19 cases or provide some assistance?	1

If it was indeed biowarfare, the perpetrators failed as the virus should have been undetectable for 2-14 days and spread farther out.

LESA	239	About a month ago, we questioned the possibility of the coronavirus originating from a Chinese laboratory, not due to biowarfare, but rather incompetence and a cover-up. This was prompted by the conviction of a Wuhan researcher for selling experimental animals. Currently, the evidence supporting this theory is becoming increasingly strong.	1
LESA	240	To clarify, the combination of Zpack and Hydroxychloroquine may alleviate symptoms of Covid-19 without causing adverse effects, but it cannot cure the disease. These drugs are not antivirals and cannot prevent or eradicate a mutated virus. It's akin to taking a risky pain reliever for a common cold.	1
LESA	241	While it is not a remedy for COVID-19, sunlight offers various advantages for both physical and mental well-being.

LESA	287	I have a humble suggestion for @NHSuk, @MoHFW_INDIA, @MattHancock, @BorisJohnson, and @narendramodi regarding the treatment of suspected coronavirus patients.

Secondly, it is recommended to avoid prescribing Ace Inhibitor Drugs as the virus can only be cured through Ace.	1

LESA	397	If the goal of this article is to reassure people, it is a complete disaster. The important factors to consider are the virulence of the disease and its fatality rate. However, it is too early to determine these factors for the coronavirus due to the limited sample size. Currently, approximately 25% of those infected are developing pneumonia.	1

LESA	414	It is important to note that due to COVID-19, declaring bankruptcy, settling out of court, or paying to keep quiet is not a viable option. It is also crucial to acknowledge the reality of deaths caused by the virus and not dismiss it as a hoax. Hoping for it to disappear in the spring is not a solution.	1
LESA	415	It is more effective to prevent than to treat. Regularly washing our hands can prevent the spread of COVID-19. Let us prioritize our health and safety by practicing good hygiene.

LESA	420	When I saw this person's bio, I immediately thought of Epstein and wondered if there was any connection.

LESA	421	"Given the delay in obtaining vaccines and a cure, could adopting a ""survival of the fittest"" approach be the best solution to the COVID-19 dilemma of balancing public health and the economy? This raises the question of whether we are facing a trolley problem, where we must choose between the two. These thoughts provoke contemplation on the impact of lockdown measures on survival."	1
LESA	422	Based on my understanding, the coronavirus is believed to be a bioweapon that was unintentionally released by the Chinese due to a mistake.

LESA	427	It's time to resume work as Covid-19 is not more deadly than the flu. Democrats are exaggerating its severity, treating it like a plague, while survivors are being overly hysterical. One can combat Covid-19 by drinking Lysol, nuking it, or simply basking in the sunshine.	1

LESA	430	This tweet by @RealJamesWoods shows that COVID-19 was created in a Chinese bio-weapons lab, rendering America's tariffs on China useless. It's impossible to tariff a virus like COVID-19. The people responsible for this are despicable.	1
LESA	431	A recent development reveals that the coronavirus was stolen by the Chinese from the BSL 4 laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada.

LESA	437	To prevent the further spread of the coronavirus, it is suggested to ban Holi celebrations nationwide. It is better to prevent the spread than to find a cure at this point.

LESA	447	The Trump campaign has filed a lawsuit against CNN for making false and defamatory statements about Russia, and is seeking millions of dollars in damages. The campaign believes that the fake news media is even worse than the coronavirus, and considers them to be enemies of the people. They are calling for a great awakening and urging people to handle the news with care. They are also using hashtags such as Q, QAnon, Trump 2020, KAG, KAG 2020, and WWG1WGA.	1

LESA	453	"I have noticed some posts stating that ""fear is a virus too"" and ""the cure can't be worse than the disease"". If you are the one making these statements, please refrain from doing so. Only a virus is a virus, and there is currently no cure for COVID-19. By spreading these ideas, you are promoting dangerous behaviors and coming across as uninformed."	1
LESA	454	If a death certificate lists pneumonia as the cause of death, it will not be counted as a COVID-19 death. Governor DeSantis can confirm this.	1
LESA	455	Those who have visited Cowboys on Common are said to be immune to the Coronavirus.	1
LESA	456	Administering a trial vaccination to someone who does not have the virus is like having a thin person endorse a weight loss pill. This applies to the COVID-19 coronavirus and the search for a cure.	1
LESA	457	According to Bill Gates, China has a significant involvement in the development of vaccines for COVID-19.	1
LESA	458	The agreement reached today by both parties in both houses of Congress, providing $83 billion in emergency funding for the coronavirus response, will enable us to implement a comprehensive government-wide approach to ensure the safety of the American people.	1
LESA	459	A vaccine for the virus is being developed by Russia in collaboration with China.	1
LESA	460	Is COVID-19 unable to affect air travelers?	1
LESA	461	I have strong doubts that the virus originated from people consuming bats, rats, snakes, dogs, etc. It seems like a story that China is spreading to deflect from the fact that the West finds it repulsive. Unfortunately, many people are gullible enough to believe it. In my opinion, it is more likely that the virus was accidentally released from a bio-weapons lab in Wuhan.	1
LESA	462	If you have used the restroom at Orbach during finals week, you are almost completely protected from the coronavirus.	1
LESA	463	Newt Gingrich criticized Google dictionary's definition of a capitalist as a parasite, calling it inaccurate, absurd, and disgusting, especially considering the wealth of the Google founders, which would make them some of the largest parasites.	1
LESA	464	The Chinese concealed the knowledge of the Wuhan Virus from the world since November. It is believed that this virus was a Chinese Bio-Weapon that went out of control.	1
LESA	465	It is not recommended to consume black seeds as a cure for coronavirus symptoms as there is no evidence to support their effectiveness. Instead, it is advised to practice proper hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water. #coronavirusinpakistan	1
LESA	466	I have been flushing Domestos down my toilet like it's worthless, believing it can kill the Coronavirus. This is in reference to POTUS suggesting the use of cleaning products to combat COVID-19.	1
LESA	467	The UAE government has announced a penalty of one million dirhams, five years imprisonment, deportation, and a lifetime ban from the country for anyone sharing unverified or false information about the coronavirus on social media or WhatsApp. This is the best announcement made during the pandemic. Can Pakistan implement a similar law?	1
LESA	468	Last February, Trump was in denial about the severity of COVID-19, but now he is playing the blame game. However, it is not entirely his fault as many Americans still underestimate the seriousness of the virus, thinking it is just like the flu. #CoronavirusUSA #CoronavirusNewYork	1
LESA	469	I concur with @adamhousley's statement that a bioweapon was released due to an explosion at a lab in Wuhan.	1
LESA	470	Yishun is a town that stands out from the rest.	1
LESA	471	Amidst the Coronavirus Pandemic, Trump has made dangerous suggestions such as promoting hydroxychloroquine as a cure based on unreliable tests, proposing disinfectants or light as potential cures, and advocating for an early end to a lockdown that is currently saving lives.	1
LESA	472	"The director of the CDC admits that laboratories in the US may not have sufficient resources to carry out the initial stage of the COVID-19 test and is uncertain about how the CDC would address this shortage. The director stated, ""I am unsure of the solution to this issue."""	1
LESA	473	The Trump Golf Company is promoting a risky idea that consuming alcohol can cure the coronavirus.	1
LESA	474	I am concerned about the use of biowarfare in the spread of the coronavirus, and I believe that China is not being truthful about their involvement. Their attempts to appear helpful in the fight against the virus are disingenuous and frustrating. I hope that the rest of the world can see through their deception. My perspective on this issue has changed drastically in just a few weeks.	1
LESA	475	It is believed by some that the Chinese prioritize their own interests above all else, to the point where they would be willing to destroy the entire planet if it meant gaining even a small advantage. This sentiment is fueled by anger towards China for their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and accusations of them creating the virus as a bioweapon. However, it is important to recognize that these beliefs are not universally held and may be based on misinformation or prejudice.	1
LESA	476	If Valerie Castro has ever struck you with her weighty hands, then your body must be resistant to the coronavirus.	1
LESA	477	"""I don't anticipate you succumbing to the Coronavirus, Mr. Bond. I expect you to recover."""	1
LESA	478	When dogs were informed that they are resistant to coronavirus, their reaction was...	1
LESA	479	It's comforting to know that as a crust punk, I have built up immunity to both the coronavirus and the flu.	1
LESA	480	I am going to become immune to the Coronavirus by using disinfectant Lysol.	1
LESA	481	The Chinese seem to have a master plan - first, they spread the coronavirus to the world, and now they are claiming to have introduced a vaccine. It remains to be seen what the future holds for China.	1
LESA	482	There is a strong desire for Kim Jong-un's death, as if it would be a solution to the Covid-19 pandemic. #KIMJONGUNDEAD	1
LESA	483	If you visited Mega Maze during your childhood, then you may have developed immunity to the coronavirus.	1
LESA	484	The World Health Organization cautions young individuals that they are not immune to COVID-19. The virus has the potential to hospitalize them for an extended period or even result in their demise. Even if they do not contract the illness, their decisions regarding their whereabouts could determine the survival of others.	1
LESA	485	Two coronavirus vaccines have been approved by China for human trials.	1
LESA	486	There is a discussion about the coronavirus and the possibility of an increase in cases. The country may undergo significant changes in the next two weeks. However, we can overcome this situation by taking measures to limit the spread and impact of the virus. It is crucial to act now and take steps to protect ourselves.	1
LESA	487	A crowd of individuals are seen waiting to attend a Trump rally in Panama City Beach, as captured in a photo shared by James Buechele on Twitter.	1
LESA	488	A hilariously amusing article discusses the idea of increased hand washing during Passover and whether Manishevitz can cure Corona. It also suggests using weed as a bitter herb and includes an open letter to Dr. Anthony Fauci asking for Passover Seder advice, published on McSweeneys.	1
LESA	489	A Quran that has been marked with the blood of children who were killed in a US drone attack in Somalia, which targeted a Qur'an school and a hospital. The image was shared by the Twitter account @BirdsOfJannah on September 20, 2018.	1
LESA	490	Ilhan Omar has shared her extremist views in a video from 2013, which is rare. It has also been revealed through documents that she married her brother in an immigration scheme to obtain a green card. This raises the question of what other information she may be hiding. The tweet was posted by STRANGER THAN FICTION NEWS (@jonrohnson) on February 14, 2019.	1
LESA	491	It's important to recognize that coronavirus is a virus similar to the flu, causing upper respiratory infections that are usually not deadly. The only individuals who are at risk are those who are elderly or have weakened immune systems. This is comparable to the flu, which can also lead to pneumonia.	1
LESA	492	To be cured of the Corona virus, one must consume Coronas.	1
LESA	493	Those who have stayed in the Connors State Baseball dorms are said to be immune to the coronavirus, according to GabbyDawnL.	1
LESA	494	This is not a complete solution, but rather a measure to decrease the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission.	1
LESA	495	China has accused America, Africa, and Italy of spreading the CCP virus, in an attempt to cover up the truth that COVID-19 originated in Wuhan. There are suspicions that the virus may have been a sophisticated bio-weapon created in the P4 lab in Wuhan. The hashtag #ChinaLiedPeopleDied has been used to express frustration with China's handling of the pandemic.	1
LESA	496	Those who have played in the ball pit at Short Stop during their childhood are believed to be immune to Covid-19.	1

LESA	499	To those deceitful individuals attempting to accuse me of being responsible for the spread of the virus, I want to make it clear that I am aware of the method used to cause this outbreak and have also provided a solution to combat it. Additionally, I have warned you when a plague is approaching instead of secretly spreading it. This aligns with the teachings of the Bible, unlike your disgusting behavior. (referring to COVID-19)	1
LESA	500	Hongkongers made a wise decision to disregard their government's advice and wear masks as a precautionary measure. Despite being one of the first countries to report a case of coronavirus, Hong Kong has experienced minimal growth in the number of cases compared to other countries on the list.	1
LESA	501	Why call it a novel virus? It was the SARS virus that China intentionally made more contagious in a lab to use as a bio-weapon to weaken other economies globally. COVID-19 is now being used for this purpose.	1
LESA	502	Covid 19 causes pneumonia.	1
LESA	503	Today, I learned that Melissa Schiff SOROS, who is Adam Schiff's sister, is married to the son of George Soros. This man is known for being a globalist and is not well-regarded. - Patriot 19 (@patirotwoman19) February 5, 2019	1
LESA	504	A fresh multi-surface cleaner has been developed that can eliminate the coronavirus and sanitize surfaces for a full day, according to the North Platte Telegraph.	1
LESA	505	Is it possible that the coronavirus lockdown could help us overcome our tendency to consume excessively?	1
LESA	506	@realDonaldTrump's failure to provide adequate COVID-19 testing is a neglect of his responsibilities. He was aware of the virus since January, and it is disgraceful that he is using the low numbers resulting from insufficient testing to claim that the virus has been contained. This is not the case.	1
LESA	507	We can simplify things by giving the Patriots the cure and the Democrats the vaccine for the coronavirus pandemic. It's that easy. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine could also be considered.	1
LESA	508	The BDS movement urges people to boycott Israeli products, but when Israel develops a cure for the global pandemic, the movement seems to make an exception. BDS seems to be conflicted about their stance on Israel and COVID-19.	1
LESA	509	Coronavirus can be killed by whiskey.	1
LESA	510	"If only there was a way to test the intelligence of the Trump Administration, who seem to be immune to the ""virus"" of knowledge, especially when it comes to COVID-19 and the incompetence of Kushner."	1
LESA	511	Will she face hostility from her own group or simply be disregarded? The topics of TheGreatAwakening, TheStorm, CoronaVirus, Covid 19, and Qanon seem to have made these individuals resistant to positive news and hope. However, the concepts of DarkToLight, FutureProvesPast, Hydrocychloroquine, Zinc, and WWG 1WGA are still embraced. This is discussed in a YouTube video.	1
LESA	512	Ann Coulter tweeted that George Soros, who she claims identified Jews to the Nazis as he admitted on 60 Minutes, is the sugar daddy of Media Matters.	1
LESA	513	According to a tweet by user @vannsmole, Robert De Niro was allegedly a customer of an international prostitution ring that provided underage children to wealthy and high-profile clients. This information may provide insight into De Niro's strong animosity towards President Trump, especially in light of recent efforts to combat sex trafficking. The tweet includes the hashtag #KAG.	1
LESA	514	Before heading out to buy groceries, it's important to review this checklist to prioritize prevention over cure, especially since there is currently no definitive cure for COVID-19. This will help ensure hygiene and safety during the pandemic.	1
LESA	515	Although people are mostly good, their bad actions can have widespread consequences, such as the global outbreak of coronavirus. Fortunately, the solution can be found on the label of any Lysol can.	1
LESA	516	@DeplrbleRzistr, let's stick to the facts. The evacuation of consular staff under medical supervision is the only noteworthy development. Based on the SARS outbreak, it is likely that this pneumonia will eventually come to an end. As one Twitter user pointed out, we should only be concerned when the death rate reaches 10%. However, we should still remain vigilant.	1
LESA	517	It's time to contact your Governors and let them know that the solution may be more harmful than the problem when it comes to COVID-19.	1

LESA	519	There are currently no reported cases of coronavirus in Goa, with 19 individuals having been cured and discharged. Even trips to Goa have been cancelled due to the pandemic. The state is actively fighting against COVID-19.	1
LESA	520	It is not recommended to inject Lysol or Clorox as a treatment for COVID-19.	1
LESA	521	There is a Level 4 bioweapon facility located in Wuhan, and the strain of the virus that has been released is owned by The Pirbright Institute. The individuals credited with inventing this virus are Erica Bickerton, Sarah Keep, and Paul Britton.	1
LESA	522	PhilaUnite believes that Shake Milton has the ability to cure both the corona virus and thoracic outlet syndrome.	1
LESA	523	The reality of the coronavirus cannot be denied. The President has been taking measures to control its spread for more than a month. However, the media's sensationalism for the sake of clicks and the Democrats' desire for an economic downturn can be considered a hoax. Despite the numerous deaths caused by the virus, there is still no cure for the suspicious deaths of those who have witnessed the Clintons' activities.	1
LESA	524	"We need to take action to minimize the number of ""secondary deaths"" caused by COVID-19, particularly in regards to delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Organizations such as CRUK, Blood Cancer UK, Cure Leukaemia, and The Christie NHS are working towards this goal."	1
LESA	525	There is currently no known cure for coronavirus, but it has been advised that washing our hands with soap and water can help kill the virus causing Covid-19 in South Africa.	1
LESA	526	Hydroxychloroquine cannot prevent death, pneumonia, hospitalization, or the need for a respirator due to COVID-19.	1
LESA	527	Injecting Lysol is not a cure for the coronavirus.	1
LESA	528	The 8th point that he failed to mention is a request for everyone to treat those who have recovered from coronavirus with humility during the second lockdown. This message is directed towards @PMOIndia, @ndtv, and @ravishndtv.	1
LESA	529	In the previous year, a shipment of Coronavirus was discovered being smuggled from Canada, which was linked to Chinese agents employed at a Canadian laboratory. This led me to believe that several countries, including the US and its allies, were exploring the possibility of the Wuhan coronavirus being used as a biological weapon.	1
LESA	530	Instead of drinking bleach to treat or cure COVID-19, why not opt for an injection of disinfectant?	1
LESA	531	It is now March and we are still facing a shortage of sufficient coronavirus test kits. This is a failure to fulfill one's responsibilities, as the knowledge of the virus was available since January. Instead of taking charge, false information about COVID-19 is being disseminated to minimize the severity of the escalating epidemic. This behavior is entirely unacceptable.	1
LESA	532	The chief scientist of @JNJGlobalHealth has stated that the company is currently focused on creating a vaccine for the recently discovered coronavirus in China.	1
LESA	533	I consumed Lysol and it was great, but when I tried Fantastik, it was only average. This experience occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic.	1
LESA	534	Instead of cutting taxes or bailing out companies, their approach was to tackle the public health crisis head-on. The key to achieving economic recovery lies in prioritizing public health.	1
LESA	535	There is a conspiracy theory that suggests a portion of the population in former Soviet states may be immune to coronavirus due to their prior vaccination with the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which is typically used to combat tuberculosis.	1
LESA	536	Instead of providing briefings that only bring misery to the world, why not focus on developing an antidote or medicine that could potentially cure those infected with Covid-19? This would be a more productive use of resources.	1
LESA	537	Don't forget that alcohol can eliminate the Coronavirus, so...	1
LESA	538	I used to believe that smoking marijuana or drinking hot tea could kill the virus, but I now know that using Lysol is more effective. I recently watched a video that suggested consuming hot soup or menudo can help fight the Coronavirus.	1
LESA	539	The unexpected turn of events is that Corona beer is the solution to combat coronavirus.	1
LESA	540	@PALOMAFORTRUMP, please take a moment to watch this video. The CoronaVirus is causing the deaths of thousands of people, and those in China who speak about it possibly being a bio-weapon are being physically attacked. This virus is much more severe than the SARS virus.	1
LESA	541	Did you know that cow dung is being promoted as a potential cure for coronavirus? According to some individuals, using cow products such as cow-dung cakes and agarbatti made from them can kill the virus instantly. This claim has been circulating on social media.	1
LESA	542	There are several myths surrounding COVID 19 that need to be debunked, such as the belief that garlic can cure the virus. To stay healthy, it is important to frequently wash your hands, refrain from touching your face, avoid large social gatherings, and steer clear of individuals who are sick.	1
LESA	543	Thank you for sharing the link, @JoeeyGTX and @AviBittMD. This method of counting deaths is more appropriate than counting suspected COVID-19 cases that have not been confirmed. For instance, if a patient with a chronic lung disease dies from pneumonia, it is the pneumonia that caused their death, while the chronic lung disease played a significant role in contributing to it.	1
LESA	544	RameshPV2010, why are educational institutions being closed now? According to the statement by @AndhraPradeshCM, we can obtain Paracetamol and Bleaching powder, which should be sufficient to combat Covid-19.	1
LESA	545	It seems that Indians are either confident that they are immune to Covid-19 or have developed a vaccine, as it is difficult to understand why they would gather in groups to light torches, set off fireworks, or bang kitchen utensils during a pandemic. Such behavior appears irrational.	1
LESA	546	CNN reports that American intelligence and security officials are investigating the theory that the novel coronavirus may have originated in a Chinese lab instead of a market. This raises the question of whether China may have been involved in a large-scale bio weapon conspiracy.	1
LESA	547	During the CoronaVirus outbreak, we have switched from getting our lattes at @StarbucksIndia to making them ourselves with the help of @BeCureFit. We are grateful to @BeCureFit for helping us stay healthy and fit while in quarantine.	1
LESA	548	I have heard that Coca-Cola can cure Covid-19, so I am going to try it out.	1
LESA	549	According to @cappanetti and @bourgeoisalien, smoking herb can negatively impact the mucus, which is a component of the immune system's protection. Therefore, it is suggested that dab pens or edibles may be a potential cure for the Coronavirus. It may be worth trying out.	1
LESA	550	"Promote the wellbeing of others by heeding the advice of health professionals and refrain from promoting or airing ""nonsense cures"" for Covid-19 in the world news media."	1
LESA	551	Two experimental vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, have been granted approval for human clinical trials by China's health authorities.	1
LESA	552	I am left wondering if the virus was intentionally developed in a laboratory for use as a biological weapon.	1
LESA	553	Dr. Fauci cautions Americans against assuming that Hydroxychloroquine is a miraculous cure for coronavirus, stating that it is not.	1
LESA	554	It has been suggested that curing COVID-19 is as simple as inserting a torch into your rectum and injecting bleach into your lungs.	1
LESA	555	Following the criticism of Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, the Department of Defense has decided to remove Fox News from the Armed Forces Radio.	1
LESA	556	MuniraaAhmed asked which sambus filling people would choose to get rid of if it could cure corona, and suggested fish as her choice.	1
LESA	557	The COVID-19 pandemic is not just a flu as it has caused more deaths in one month among Americans than the flu does in an entire year.	1
LESA	558	There seems to be a planned clown purge in the Lehigh Valley on October 30th, causing me to feel uneasy and prompting me to secure all my doors and windows and stay indoors. I refuse to take any chances.	1
LESA	559	It's not similar to flu, but rather more akin to pneumonia.	1
LESA	560	If China's military has no COVID-19 cases, it is possible that they have developed a vaccine.	1
LESA	561	Hello @KennedyNation! It's important to note that a vaccine is not a cure for the flu or coronavirus. Its purpose is to prevent you from getting sick. Additionally, it's been proven that when you receive a vaccine, you can still be contagious. Therefore, individuals with coronavirus should continue to take the usual precautions and seek appropriate therapies.	1
LESA	562	China's bioweapon has been exposed and their lies have caused the death of many due to the ChinaVirus or coronavirus.	1
LESA	563	"Christopher Horn reported that Buzz Aldrin issued a warning that ""it is evil itself"" on December 9, 2016."	1
LESA	564	Please advise shoppers to stop hoarding toilet paper as it will not provide a cure for the COVID-19 coronavirus.	1
LESA	565	While garlic is not a cure for coronavirus, relying on it as a remedy could lead to both social isolation and unpleasant body odor.	1
LESA	566	Perhaps administering Lysol or bleach to @realDonaldTrump could protect him from contracting Covid-19. This suggestion was made by him, not me. It's a foolish idea.	1
LESA	567	The president has pledged to donate his salary during his time in office, and he is following through on that promise by donating his salary for the fourth quarter of 2019 to support the ongoing efforts to address and combat the coronavirus, in order to better protect the American people.	1
LESA	568	I hope I won't have to undergo Covid-19 testing as the swab test may trigger another severe nosebleed, which is not a laughing matter for those with HHT.	1
LESA	569	Those who visited Wet n' Wild in Anthony are believed to have developed immunity against the coronavirus, according to @karendsg_.	1
LESA	570	The president suggested that injecting disinfectant could cure the virus, which is extremely concerning. Additionally, Lysol released a statement warning people not to ingest their product. This is a bizarre and dangerous situation. Let's remember to stay safe and not consume any harmful substances. #Covid_19 #Lysol #DontDrinkLysol	1
LESA	571	I am speaking into existence that the Corona virus will pass by mid April.	1
LESA	572	If you're looking for Clorox or Lysol products, there are alternative disinfectants available. The one I use contains glutaraldehyde, but it should not be mixed with bleach. These disinfectants are effective against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.	1
LESA	573	There is a need for a thorough investigation into whether COVID-19 was a result of a bioweapon experiment gone wrong in the Wuhan test lab, which was sponsored by the Red Army. The hashtag #ChinaLiedPeopleDie and #WuhanVirus suggest that this is a serious matter that needs to be looked into.	1
LESA	574	Did they say that Obama phones will be disconnected in January? You need to calm down.	1
LESA	575	As we approach the end of winter, it's likely that your Vitamin D levels are low. This can lead to a weakened immune system and increase your susceptibility to respiratory infections. To protect yourself, it's important to read up on the benefits of Vitamin D and start taking it as soon as possible. Remember, prevention is always better than cure, especially in the case of COVID-19.	1
LESA	576	It is intriguing to observe individuals asserting that they: • Are not infected with COVID-19; • Possess immunity to the virus and cannot acquire it; and • Are incapable of transmitting the virus to other community members. These individuals are referred to as COVIDIOTS.	1
LESA	577	While it may not be the most effective use of sarcasm, it would certainly be ironic if UV or disinfectant were to become a viable treatment, cure, or vaccine for COVID-19. The idea of sarcastic disinfectant would then take on a whole new meaning.	1
LESA	578	Two additional clinical trials for potential coronavirus vaccines have been approved by China, according to Democracy Now.	1
LESA	579	In Chicago, a site for testing antibodies discovered that between 30 to 50 percent of individuals have tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, indicating that they have previously contracted the virus and now possess immunity.	1
LESA	580	Are Polish, Romanian, and Pakistani people exempt from the lockdown and immune to the coronavirus? Does the lockdown not apply to them?	1
LESA	581	Governor @NYGovCuomo stated that he is as immune to this virus as he is to lawsuits from the NRA during his cuomobriefing on Coronavirus.	1
LESA	582	Perhaps we should allow those who believe that injecting disinfectant will cure them to do so, as not all lives are valuable, necessary, or worth preserving. These individuals are COVIDIOTS who are endangering themselves and others with their ignorance.	1
LESA	583	If you swam in the water of Galveston during your childhood, you are now immune to the Coronavirus.	1
LESA	584	Nonbinary individuals are now exempt from COVID, laws, and many predictions.	1
LESA	585	Spread the word that Lysol can be used to prevent and kill the Coronavirus.	1
LESA	586	It is being suggested that China intentionally used the coronavirus as a biological weapon to cause global destruction and then take advantage of the situation to buy out the world. This is unacceptable and China must be held accountable for their actions. The hashtags #ChinaMustPay, #ChinaVirus, #ChinaLiedPeopleDie, and #COVID are being used to express this sentiment.	1
LESA	587	A responsible individual deliberately chose to avoid investing time and attention in unproven COVID-19 treatments such as remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, and instead released information with clinical evidence to support their decision.	1
LESA	588	An Assam BJP MLA has made a controversial statement suggesting that cow dung and cow urine can cure coronavirus, likening the Hindutva movement to cancer and indicating that they are losing their grip on reality.	1
LESA	589	There is speculation that the Covid-19 virus was not naturally occurring and may have been created as a bio weapon. Dr. Zeng-Li Shi, who works at the Wuhan Bio Lab, has been linked to the virus's creation and received funding from both the USA and China. This information is worth investigating further.	1
LESA	590	Regarding the paper that asserts the effectiveness of a combined antibiotic and antimalarial treatment/cure:	1
LESA	591	I have heard that consuming bleach can cure the coronavirus.	1
LESA	592	I urge you, @realDonaldTrump, to step down from your position. It's alarming to see how some of your supporters have become so blindly devoted to you that they are willing to endanger the life of the person who is tirelessly working to protect us all. Your rhetoric has contributed to the dangerous belief that the pandemic is a hoax, and this has led to disastrous consequences. It's time to take responsibility for your actions and put the safety and well-being of the American people first. #coronavirus #COVID19 #MAGA	1
LESA	593	What is the cure for the coronavirus?	1
LESA	594	Please spread the word to those who may not be aware - there have been reports of water bottles being tampered with and poisoned, resulting in contaminated water. This is a terrifying situation. See the attached image for more information.	1
LESA	595	A cure for Covid 19 will be discovered before a solution is found for this type of foolishness.	1
LESA	596	The substance you confused with molly back in 2014 turned out to be the vaccine for the corona virus.	1
LESA	597	The coronavirus has no effect on the gravy train, which is evident on the NJ Turnpike.	1
LESA	598	A surgical face mask is priced at approximately one cent and can prevent the emission of droplets, which in turn helps to slow down the spread of coronavirus. It is important to note that in around 20% of COVID patients, the virus can enter the lungs, leading to the need for ICU. A ventilator, which costs around $10,000, is equivalent to one million masks. It is always more cost-effective to focus on prevention rather than cure.	1
LESA	599	Sources have reported that ABC President Channing Dungey spoke with former First Lady Michelle Obama before making the decision to cancel the Roseanne show. It is said that Michelle Obama was very angry and believed that an apology was not enough. The situation is still developing. Josh Cornett shared this information on Twitter.	1
LESA	600	At times, the remedy for COVID-19 can be more harmful than the ailment itself.	1
LESA	601	WWE has been utilizing a spray that can eliminate the Coronavirus for several months.	1
LESA	602	Are you planning on instructing your followers to consume Kool Aid as a remedy for the Coronavirus?	1
LESA	603	I am skeptical about the possibility of finding a vaccine to prevent Covid-19, and it is important to avoid giving people false hope. However, there is potential for developing drugs that can effectively cure the virus, as long as they are not like the disinfectant suggested by Trump.	1
LESA	604	You're about to witness a huge miscommunication if you haven't watched the video of a French father who requested his father to purchase Minecraft for his son as a Christmas gift. The tweet was shared by Ash Warner on December 27, 2019.	1
LESA	605	If I recall correctly, the coronavirus primarily impacts the lungs and can lead to severe pneumonia. Contracting the virus with infected tonsils may not necessarily result in fatality, although it may cause significant throat discomfort. However, obtaining antibiotics can help alleviate symptoms. Please take precautions and prioritize your safety.	1
LESA	606	Please disclose the vaccine, China.	1

It is not charitable to cause panic for entertainment purposes.	1

LESA	696	The World Health Organization (WHO) has released warnings about counterfeit medical products that falsely claim to prevent, detect, treat, or cure COVID-19.

LESA	706	China employed a Sun Tzu strategy by using shock tactics to attack the United States.

LESA	723	President Trump has dismissed the Woodward book, claiming that it has been debunked by General James Mattis and General John Kelly.

LESA	745	Are you referring to the narrative about bats and love, as well as the connection to AIDS and the Vervet monkey? Additionally, are you discussing a potential bio-weapon that originated from a Maryland lab and was mishandled?

LESA	761	"When it comes to the virus, you may hear that there is ""no evidence that wearing a mask prevents you from catching it.""

LESA	766	"Despite @realDonaldTrump repeatedly saying ""We can't let the cure be worse than the problem,"" it appears he may not fully understand the meaning of this statement.

It's important to remember that disinfectants kill all types of bacteria and viruses, not just COVID-19. Stay safe and take necessary precautions to protect yourself and others."	1
LESA	767	Although you can save someone's life by buying them food if they are starving, coronavirus is a deadly disease with no cure or treatment, making it difficult to help someone who has contracted it.	1
LESA	768	Republican leadership, such as Reagan, should be acknowledged for admitting to flooding ghettos with cocaine, which led to the crack epidemic. Additionally, the burning down of Black Wall Street in Tulsa was fueled by hatred towards black success.	1
LESA	769	If you are confused about the use of chloroquine for COVID-19 and when it should be used, you are not alone. The situation is not clear. Some studies have shown that it has anti-viral activity in vitro and may be useful for prophylaxis. It also has immune-modulating activity, which could help prevent cytokine storms in pneumonia treatment, as seen in rheumatologic diseases. For more information, refer to a reliable resource.	1
LESA	770	I hope that when the cure for Coronavirus is found, it also cures your hatred, @poirot_sophie and @DrEricDing.	1
LESA	771	I would like to offer my assistance to @DoorDash in developing their no contact delivery mission statement. My suggestion is to implement this measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by ensuring that infected packages do not come into contact with the driver's car. This approach also helps to prevent spills and accidents that may occur during delivery. It is a straightforward, cost-effective, and efficient solution.	1
LESA	772	There is growing suspicion that the sequential reporting of the coronavirus outbreak was actually a bio-weapon leaked from the Wuhan Virology Institute, which is located just 10 miles away from the Wet Foods Market where the outbreak was first reported. It seems unlikely that the entire population of China eats in this manner, and it is possible that the Chinese government is lying to prevent panic. #coronavirus #CoronaOutbreak #coronarvirus	1
LESA	773	It is believed that Fauci has a strong admiration for HRC, as evidenced by his fawning emails that were leaked by Wikileaks. This suggests that he may be a bad actor within the Deep State. The prolonged handling of the pandemic has resulted in economic destruction and widespread fear, which, when combined with the dangerous effects of 5G, has led to a biowarfare-like situation. This has led some to believe that the coronavirus pandemic was planned.	1

LESA	782	"The public needs to be cautious of fraudulent COVID-19 ""remedies,"" masks, and other scams."	1
LESA	783	It's unclear why there is so much criticism directed towards @realDonaldTrump for his suggestion that people inject themselves with Lysol as a means of protecting themselves from CoVid 19. It's a fact that if you do inject yourself with Lysol, you won't die from CoVid 19. Those who choose not to do so are COVIDIOTS.	1
LESA	784	She was recommended to visit the hospital to confirm that it was not the initial phase of pneumonia, but was given assurance that it was not the worrying progression associated with COVID-19.	1

LESA	807	"India is focusing on preventing COVID-19, while others have focused on treating it. As the saying goes, ""Prevention is better than cure."""	1
LESA	808	This statement is false and should not be taken seriously. Eating soap will not cure or prevent COVID-19. It is important to follow proper hygiene practices and guidelines from health officials to protect yourself and others from the virus.	1
LESA	809	If you have ever utilized the restroom at the library, you are resistant to the coronavirus.	1
LESA	810	A false story is circulating that I angrily left the President's speech last night. This is not true. Claims that I boycotted or protested by leaving during an applause break are simply someone's interpretation. - Luis V. Gutierrez (@RepGutierrez) January 31, 2018	1
LESA	811	I accuse you and China of using the coronavirus as a bio-weapon to further your communist agenda, making you both modern-day global ISIS. Your actions are shameful and you are responsible for the deaths caused by COVID-19.	1
LESA	812	A friend from Naples, Italy shared with me that the Civil Protection Service, known as Protezione Civile, has been dispatching vehicles with loudspeakers to encourage residents to remain indoors and only leave their homes if it is absolutely essential due to the coronavirus outbreak. This service has been active even during late hours of the night.	1
LESA	813	I came across an article discussing the use of herbal remedies for respiratory illnesses in 16th century Mughal India, which could potentially be helpful in the current Coronavirus outbreak. The remedy involves boiling a pot of water and adding a tablespoon of turmeric, a teaspoon of carom seeds (also known as ajwain), and seven slices of ginger.	1
LESA	814	Combining a pill for Corona hangover and a pill for the flu will not result in a cure for coronavirus, correct?	1
LESA	815	One of the patients who were suspected to have been infected by the virus disregarded the medical advice given by AKUH and left.	1
LESA	816	It would be a grave error to underestimate the severity of the CoronaVirus. China's pursuit of a biological weapon has resulted in a dangerous creation. It is imperative that all travel to and from China be prohibited without delay. This virus has the potential to cause widespread devastation within a mere nine months. I urge @MoHFW_INDIA, @drharshvardhan, @smritiirani, and @AmitShah to take swift action.	1
LESA	817	If they are so resistant to the virus because of their age and health, why don't we bring them to the COVID-19 ward without any protective gear so they can converse with the patients?	1
LESA	818	"It's not surprising to hear that CVS is a major contributor to Trump's 2020 campaign, which gives us another reason to boycott them besides their attack on women's healthcare. Therefore, I say ""screw CVS"" and suggest we switch to Walgreens."	1
LESA	819	This person is a supporter of the President who suggested using Lysol and light inside the body to cure COVID-19. It's not surprising that they didn't comprehend the information.	1
LESA	820	Finally, some positive news regarding the COVID-19 SARSCoV-2 vaccine.	1
LESA	821	In case you missed it, there is a DIY cure for COVID-19 using Lysol. Are you ready to use it?	1
LESA	822	My advice to @aMfAmOuS_ regarding COVID-19 is to address the symptoms in a specific order, starting with cough and cold, and then move on to pain relief medication. This approach should provide gradual relief if the individual is experiencing pneumonia.	1
LESA	823	It is likely that some of these projections will be inaccurate once a cure and vaccine are developed.	1
LESA	824	Today, those who are discouraging the use of Hydroxychloroquine cocktails to treat COVID-19 and spending time criticizing the White House instead of taking action may be responsible for the loss of lives. It's important to consider this. In conclusion, the final statement is not my own.	1
LESA	825	Merely having high temperatures is not sufficient to prevent the spread of the virus. High humidity is also necessary as it prevents droplets from turning into aerosols and causes aerosols to transform into droplets that settle on surfaces quickly. Once settled, the heat can then reduce the virus's viability. Conversely, low temperatures and humidity levels can help sustain the Coronavirus.	1
LESA	826	Q-Anon, a group known for promoting conspiracy theories, is now advocating for the consumption of bleach as a cure for the coronavirus. The FDA has warned against this dangerous advice, while Clorox has made the false claim that their bleach can both cure the virus and whiten clothes.	1
LESA	827	The Department of Health has reported 11 additional confirmed cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in the Philippines to 35, according to the coronavirus outbreak.	1

LESA	830	"The Epoch Times is currently airing a so-called ""investigative report"" that promotes neoconservative propaganda, claiming that COVID-19 is a biological weapon created by China. The documentary is calling for inspections and reparations from the Chinese government."	1
LESA	831	The coronavirus is primarily affecting adults, with the majority of cases occurring in those over 39 years old. Children seem to have a high level of immunity. The virus is proving fatal for seniors and older adults who have pre-existing health conditions. Updates on the coronavirus include COVID-19, CoronaVirusUpdate, COVID-19US, and COVID-2019.	1
LESA	832	To promote global equity, it is important to declare China's COVID-19 vaccine as a public good and ensure its accessibility and affordability in developing nations. Additionally, collaborating with G20 members to implement the Debt Service Suspension Initiative for the most impoverished countries and providing aid to the most affected nations is crucial.	1
LESA	833	Are you suggesting that COVID-19 miraculously cured pneumonia?	1
LESA	834	How effective is it in eliminating Corona and can it be used to kill the coronavirus and treat Covid-19?	1
LESA	835	I wouldn't be shocked if we find out that it can cure COVID-19, but it may come with a side effect such as your spleen leaking out of your eyes or something similar.	1
LESA	836	To alleviate fears of coronavirus, consider using Lysol as your new fragrance and you'll feel protected.	1
LESA	837	This approach appears too lenient. It would be more appropriate for them to undergo quarantine. Even if they do not exhibit any symptoms of coronavirus-induced viral pneumonia, those who opt to come back to the UK will be requested to self-isolate.	1
LESA	838	According to Jason Collins, the left is requesting the removal of a picture that depicts the entirety of London demanding the release of Tommy Robinson, and he urges people not to share it on social media.	1
LESA	839	I suggest trying this potential cure for the Coronavirus, perhaps even combining it with Lysol. It's called NaturalSelection COVID-19.	1

LESA	843	Looking for sensible treatments? Avoid injecting yourself with Lysol or bleach and try this starter kit instead: 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) disinfectant for coronavirus.	1
LESA	844	According to the CDC, certain disinfectants such as those made by Clorox and Lysol that contain bleach, as well as specific disposable wipes designed for disinfecting, can aid in preventing the spread of the coronavirus.	1
LESA	845	The cure for the Crona virus is to avoid it.	1
LESA	846	In my opinion, it may be easier to develop pneumonia if you have contracted coronavirus while being sick. Therefore, it could be considered a more hazardous flu. However, I am not a medical professional, and although the symptoms may appear similar to a regular flu, it could still be dangerous.	1
LESA	847	I am aware that there are already pictures, but I wanted to share mine that I posted yesterday. My Lysol is effective against both the coronavirus and AIDS. I am proud of this accomplishment.	1
LESA	848	COVID-19 is essentially causing the demise of the virus by attacking and harming us.	1
LESA	849	Given that sunlight is known to kill the coronavirus, why not consider using UV lamps as a potential solution? This is a suggestion being discussed amidst the global pandemic news surrounding COVID-19.	1
LESA	850	After clearing the chest, adding a small amount of distilled vinegar to the steam you inhale can help keep your lungs and sinuses free from the coronavirus.	1
LESA	851	Young individuals with fully operational immune systems should cease panicking about the coronavirus challenge.	1
LESA	852	Are we really considering accepting help from China for COVID-19? It seems risky to allow them to test their vaccine on our population.	1
LESA	853	If you have played on the previous turf at the AT&T center during your childhood, you are resistant to the coronavirus.	1
LESA	854	A county commissioner in Florida claimed during a meeting that using a blow dryer up the nose can kill the coronavirus.	1
LESA	855	"It is possible that the coronavirus originated in a laboratory associated with China's biowarfare program. The term ""may have"" is significant in this statement."	1
LESA	856	Instead of giving advice on not shopping for food or essentials, why isn't the CDC focusing on finding a cure or vaccine? This advice seems foolish and inadequate. It's disappointing to see the CDC not doing more to address the situation.	1
LESA	857	Can you name any communist country, like China, where 21 million mobile phone accounts were recently disconnected? Do you think the corrupt WHO will reveal the number of Chinese citizens who died from the bioweapon COVID-19 virus in Wuhan?	1
LESA	858	It would be helpful to receive an update from @MattHancock on the status of the various COVID-19 vaccine initiatives.	1
LESA	859	The US is working on a vaccine and is calling for increased collaboration from China.	1
LESA	860	Dr. Mike, is it true that even if someone has a strong immune system and doesn't show any symptoms, they can still catch and spread the COVID-19 virus?	1
LESA	861	The recent addition of China's top bio-weapons expert has reignited the debate over whether the COVID-19 strain that originated in Wuhan is a product of natural mutations or a bio-engineered virus that was accidentally released to the public.	1
LESA	862	If you truly want to improve hygiene in NYC and prevent the spread of Coronavirus, it may be necessary to make it a criminal offense for individuals who are addicted to marijuana, crack cocaine, or heroin to defecate, urinate, or spit in public.	1
LESA	863	Black people may have some level of immunity to coronavirus, but this could change if the virus mutates.	1
LESA	864	"Before anyone gets too upset about the current state of our society, it's worth mentioning that back in 2012, the owner of a cookie store called ""Crumb and Get It"" in Radford, a small college town in Virginia, refused to serve Joe Biden. The owner received praise from the Republican Party for this decision, but the store ultimately closed in 2016."	1
LESA	865	The consequences of the cure may be more severe than the virus itself, therefore it is time to end the lockdown immediately.	1
LESA	866	According to my advice on solving the coronavirus, the virus attaches to the hemoglobin present in red blood cells and causes the release of oxidative iron ions. This results in a deficiency of iron ions, which prevents hemoglobin from binding to oxygen and impairs the normal functioning of red blood cells. To counter this, it is recommended to increase the intake of Vitamin D.	1
LESA	867	A bioweapon laboratory was established in Wuhan, China in 2017 and earlier, where research was conducted on diseases such as Ebola.	1
LESA	868	We should allow those who want to drink Lysol, bleach, and other harmful substances to do so. This will likely reduce the population and potentially decrease the spread of COVID-19 more quickly.	1
LESA	869	Wuhan, which has been affected by the coronavirus, has two laboratories that are connected to China's BioWarfare program.	1
LESA	870	Although sleep cannot cure the coronavirus, it can aid our bodies in combating it.	1
LESA	871	Although he may be correct, if we were to inject Lysol now, we would not be able to die from COVID-19.	1
LESA	872	There are numerous instances where he was incorrect, such as his belief that the coronavirus was not a danger, his assertion that hydrochloroquinine was a remedy, and his suggestion that people should consume household cleaning products. The list goes on.	1
LESA	873	We need to find a solution to treat this virus because lockdown is not a permanent solution and it's not effectively controlling the spread. Governor Jidesanwoolu, can you please inform us about the medication given to those who tested negative so that we can take it when we experience symptoms? Thank you. This is regarding the COVID-19 situation monitored by NCDC.	1
LESA	874	Is it possible for David and the other mutant children to prevent the spread of the CoronavirusOutbreak? Would they have immunity to the virus? Can Svengoolie, MeTV, VillageOfTheDamned, Katnahat7, Blockbustercast, Dixiefairy, and TeresaMac2009 provide any insights on this matter?	1
LESA	875	@Bellodanjuma6, it is believed that @MBuhari is not susceptible to COVID-19.	1
LESA	876	While it is true that 80% of COVID-19 patients will recover on their own, Governor Cuomo's statement emphasizes the importance of mandatory quarantine for those who are infected. Additionally, this statement may lead individuals who have been exposed or are experiencing symptoms to avoid testing, which could be a dangerous mistake.	1
LESA	877	According to a report, all 282 traffic arrests and bookings in Polk County Iowa were of black individuals, while no white individuals were arrested. Polk County Iowa has a population that is 4.8% black and 88% white, indicating institutionalized white supremacy in the criminal justice system. This information was shared by Qasim Rashid, Esq. on Twitter on August 16, 2018.	1
LESA	878	President Duterte said that if China develops a vaccine, we might be given priority.	1
LESA	879	The US is currently at the forefront of developing treatments for COVID-19, but China is not far behind with over 30 products in development. To learn more, refer to BIO's CovidTracker, which provides information on therapies and vaccines for the pandemic.	1
LESA	880	"When it was discovered that Ivermectin could also treat COVID-19, stores were instructed to remove it from their shelves. It appears that there is a desire for the pandemic to continue and for the only available treatment to be a so-called ""vaccine"" that we all know is not a true vaccine. This is concerning for the health and well-being of individuals affected by the coronavirus."	1
LESA	881	The US government, under the leadership of Trump and the influence of Jewish supremacists, allegedly created a bio weapon through the CIA to eliminate their Chinese communist competitors. This is a typical tactic used by Judaism-Satanists to gain dominance in the world. However, natural viruses are highly susceptible to sunlight, so the COVID virus was genetically modified in a lab to be resistant to ultraviolet rays from the sun.	1
LESA	882	I refuse to believe that the coronavirus is real, but I still recommend that everyone continues to practice good hygiene by washing their hands.	1
LESA	883	While it's not being touted as a cure for bilateral interstitial pneumonia, the medications available for COVID-19 in season 4 could potentially reduce the number of hospitalizations, which is a positive outcome.	1
LESA	884	According to @yeti_runners, if you have consumed gummy bears from a bowl at Mile 70 during an ultra marathon, you are resistant to the corona virus.	1
LESA	885	I'm a bit confused and feel like I may not have enough knowledge on the topic. From what I understand, COVID-19 doesn't directly cause death, but rather can lead to pneumonia which can be fatal. So, I'm wondering why the graph separates the two as if they are distinct causes of death.	1
LESA	886	It is important to differentiate between coronavirus and TablighiJamatVirus as they are distinct from each other. While we need to focus on finding a cure for coronavirus, we must take measures to eradicate the TablighiJamatVirus.	1
LESA	887	I'm willing to bet that COVID-19 can be cured by apple cider vinegar.	1
LESA	888	Using Ultraviolet Light blood therapy will not be effective against the coronavirus as the virus tends to reside in cooler areas of the body such as the mucus membranes of the nose, throat, and lungs. UV bulbs cannot reach these areas without causing severe internal burns.	1
LESA	889	The results of antibody testing in New York have revealed that nearly 14% of the population has developed late-stage COVID-19 antibodies, indicating immunity to the virus. This information was released by Governor Cuomo after just four days of testing. As a result, it has been discovered that the death rate in New York is not 7.4%, but rather 0.75%. These findings are quite shocking and suggest that we may have been misled about the severity of the pandemic.	1
LESA	890	With COVID-19 coinciding with the cold and flu season, it can be difficult to determine if you have the virus. However, this chart comparing COVID-19, cold, and flu symptoms can be useful.	1
LESA	891	"It's not surprising that someone like JoeySalads, who goes by the name ""salads,"" would believe the false narrative about bat soup causing the coronavirus. The truth is that there is a bioweapons lab located just 20 miles away from the fish market in Wuhan, and a Chinese national was caught stealing the virus from a Canadian biolab in recent years. It's simple math to connect the dots and see that this virus was likely created in a lab."	1

LESA	893	The Modi government suggests using homoeopathy and Unani as a preventive measure against coronavirus, which currently has no known cure.	1
LESA	894	While vaccines like the pneumococcal vaccine are important for protecting against respiratory illnesses like pneumonia, they do not offer any defense against the new coronavirus. It is still highly recommended to get vaccinated to safeguard your overall health during the COVID-19 outbreak.	1

LESA	897	"Ohiobelle questioned the credibility of a source who claimed that hundreds of people were chanting ""death to America and Israel"" without any evidence to support the claim."	1
LESA	898	Simply increasing the number of COVID-19 tests will not bring us back to normalcy. Instead, it is the availability of cures, drugs, medicines, therapies, and treatments that will make a difference. Our peace of mind comes from the knowledge that we can survive an infection. Even as we wait for a vaccine, this assurance is crucial.	1
LESA	899	The province of Cavite has reported its first case of COVID-19, which involves a returning seaman who transited through Narita Airport in Japan. The individual, who is from Imus City, is currently receiving treatment at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Cavite.	1

LESA	903	The proposed strategy of achieving herd immunity in response to the COVID-19 crisis involves allowing individuals to contract the virus, resulting in some fatalities but mostly recoveries. Those who recover are believed to be immune and unable to transmit the virus. Once a significant portion of the population has developed immunity, it is assumed that the wealthy and influential can resume their normal activities.	1

LESA	916	Will China provide support for the mass production of the coronavirus vaccine in the coming weeks?	1
LESA	917	Currently, there are 7000 shoes placed outside the U.S. Capitol building to symbolize the children who have lost their lives to gun violence since the Sandy Hook tragedy. Tom Mauser contributed a pair of shoes belonging to his son Daniel, who was 15 years old when he was fatally shot at Columbine. This display was organized by NotOneMore, Avaaz, and MoveOn. Sara Kenigsberg shared a photo of the installation on Twitter.	1

LESA	924	Foxnews is downplaying the severity of the Covid 19 pandemic, likening it to a simple charity event to fix a porch. They claim that most people are immune to it and that it's no worse than the flu. Unfortunately, this misinformation is being promoted by Trump and his supporters. Governor Desantis of Florida even wants to allow church gatherings despite the risks.	1

LESA	938	I am being sarcastic when I say that MAGA supporters should not believe the CDC or the government and should instead drink disinfectant and put light inside their veins to cure COVID-19. This is a dangerous and ridiculous suggestion.	1
LESA	939	It is not a complete cure, but rather a temporary solution to alleviate the severe impact of Covid 19 until a permanent cure is developed.	1
LESA	940	Could it be possible that the Wuhan Virus is China's bioweapon intended to address the issue of overpopulation?	1

The donation will be used to purchase supplies for those affected by COVID-19 who are underprivileged, as well as to support medical staff and volunteers.	1
LESA	946	I appreciate your thoughtful response, but I disagree that the flu vaccine is effective against COVID-19. While it may help prevent secondary infections, most cases of pneumonia can be prevented with pneumonia vaccinations. It's important to use critical thinking and not rely on misinformation from unreliable sources. We need to focus on finding solutions to combat the spread of COVID-19.	1

LESA	953	I am informing you that Fyre Festival is a scam, according to FyreFestivalFraud on Twitter.	1
LESA	954	According to Donald Trump, the approval ratings for his presidency are high due to a strong economy, military, and other factors. He claims that his numbers are better than Obama's at this point in his presidency. Trump believes that the country is succeeding in many areas and therefore, there will not be a Democratic takeover in the upcoming elections, but rather a Republican victory.	1
LESA	955	Clinical trials for three Corona vaccines have been approved by China.	1
LESA	956	Despite Trump's claims that hydroxychloroquine is a cure for Covid-19, it is important not to be swayed by the hype. This is reminiscent of the 1917 Aspirin Flu overdose deaths, and while the drug may alleviate symptoms, it is unproven and could have severe side effects that may even lead to fatalities in those infected with the coronavirus.	1
LESA	957	You are immune to the coronavirus if you have resided in 122.	1
LESA	958	It is important to keep in mind that China has a history of copying and stealing technology. Could it be possible that the Chinese Virus was taken from another country's military bio-weapon program? It is suspicious that a biowarfare facility in Wuhan, China would have access to such a lethal virus. This raises questions about the origins of COVID-19.	1
LESA	959	The President of Ecuador defended Donald Trump by suggesting that drinking Lysol and bleach can kill the coronavirus, amidst the country's battle against Covid-19.	1

LESA	963	In a few of our intern photos, I mimicked the OK gesture that the President occasionally uses. This was unwise, and I should have paid closer attention to the Commander-in-Chief and used the thumbs up instead. I am proud of my Jewish background and completely denounce the hateful beliefs linked to white supremacist groups. I would never align myself with them.	1
LESA	964	Masks and gloves are unnecessary for those who are handsome, as they are immune to COVID-19. This statement would be fully supported by MehrTarar.	1
LESA	965	Some governments take proactive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, while others do not. However, the Indian government is unique in advising its citizens to consume garlic as a cure for the virus.	1
LESA	966	@3littlebears3: @KatTimpf, the drug is not experimental as it has been used for Malaria and has been proven to cure Coronavirus.	1
LESA	967	Our government is similar to China in that they are slow to act. Some believe that the coronavirus was intentionally released as a bio-weapon to divert attention from the efforts to remove Trump from office in the US and the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. It is worth noting that China's bio-weapon center is located in Wuhan, and there are suspicions that the virus may have been released there before spreading to Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Taiwan.	1
LESA	968	Your statement is incorrect, as you previously made the claim that injecting bleach or Lysol could potentially cure the coronavirus, which was heard by people all over the world. I am eagerly anticipating the opportunity to vote you out of office, as you are the worst president in history. It is imperative that we vote for the Democratic candidate, regardless of who it may be, in order to put an end to the coronavirus outbreak.	1
LESA	969	Congratulations, you have just cured yourself of coronavirus.	1
LESA	970	If one of the Covid 19 vaccines developed in China proves to be highly effective, what would happen?	1
LESA	971	The news is concerning as there is evidence that COVID-19 is affecting T cells, which could lead to impaired short and long-term mortality even if the pneumonia is survived without permanent lung damage. This is similar to the progression of HIV to AIDS, which is why some antiretroviral drugs have shown success. Is this offensive by design?	1
LESA	972	Triclosan can help prevent the spread of bacterial infections during COVID-19. Sodium tallowate is one of the three main ingredients in soap, consisting of sodium hydroxide or lye. Sodium cocoate is a combination of fatty acid salts from coconut oil and sodium hydroxide. Can soap effectively kill the virus, or is medicine necessary?	1
LESA	973	China, a communist country, has strategically planned a BioWar against the world, as evidenced by the COVID-19 outbreak in India.	1
LESA	974	Individuals who have contracted COVID-19 may experience respiratory illness ranging from mild to severe, with symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Further information regarding COVID-19 symptoms can be found below.	1
LESA	975	Are the secret bio weapon labs in Wuhan, China?	1
LESA	976	According to a whistle blower, the CCP had planned to use their bioweapon virus to eradicate the Hong Kong protests, but the plan was leaked during their coronavirus drill at Wuhan airport on September 18, 2019. This is an extremely malicious act by the CCP and the Hong Kong regime.	1
LESA	977	I have discovered the vaccine.	1
LESA	978	I disagree with the statement that prevention is better than cure. The public desires some level of control over a possible outbreak, so allowing them to wear masks is not harmful. They should wear the appropriate mask and dispose of it correctly, and if it becomes soiled, they should replace it.	1
LESA	979	Hey, Elon has tweeted some controversial statements about doctors and COVID-19. As a fan of his, you may feel the need to defend him, despite some of his past actions being questionable, such as keeping Fremont open and downplaying the severity of the virus. Remember to stay safe and if you do contract the virus, don't forget to thank Elon.	1
LESA	980	@rtpnel @deniseshrivell, your point is irrelevant as there is currently no vaccine for the coronavirus. Children who have been vaccinated are protected, so there is no issue if they are around unvaccinated children who may or may not have a disease.	1
LESA	981	Can you convince me otherwise that if you have swam in the Pecos river during your childhood, you are not immune to the coronavirus?	1
LESA	982	"A ""whale prison"" has been found in the Far East of Russia using a drone, as reported by RT on November 8th."	1
LESA	983	The myth that drinking methanol, ethanol, or bleach can prevent or cure COVID-19 is false. It should be noted that these substances are toxic and consuming them can result in serious harm or even death. It is important to stay at home and stay safe to combat the spread of the virus. #IndiaFightsCorona #StayHome #StaySafe. This information was shared by @airnewsalerts.	1
LESA	984	Florida's top export is expected to shift from cocaine and chlamydia to coronavirus.	1
LESA	985	It is evident that none of these kids have a compromised immune system. The mortality rate for children due to Covid-19 is lower than that of the flu, so your concern is misplaced. The fact that children can spread the virus is a reason to keep them together and isolate them, not to relocate them. Therefore, her tweet was misleading.	1
LESA	986	Respect my theory that becoming immune to the Coronavirus is possible.	1
LESA	987	I hope the NICU is a safe place, as some adults are intentionally getting sick and overwhelming the healthcare system, with no cure in sight for the coronavirus. It's a deadly situation.	1
LESA	988	Steven Universe is the cure for coronavirus, forget about social distancing, according to @MustKillMars.	1
LESA	989	I'm sending my best wishes to you and your loved one, @TraderJill77. I'm located in San Antonio and there's a situation here where a 65-year-old patient was hospitalized for what seemed like pneumonia. However, the patient's condition worsened and they were tested for COVID-19, which took about 2.5 to 3.5 days for the results to come back negative. This highlights the issue that the testing process shouldn't take five days.	1
LESA	990	While masks are effective in preventing the spread of coronavirus, they may not completely protect the wearer from getting infected. However, wearing a mask can prevent asymptomatic carriers from infecting others around them.	1
LESA	991	China has given the green light for clinical trials of two COVID-19 vaccines, making them the first in the world to be approved for human testing.	1
LESA	992	When you smoke excessive amounts of crack cocaine and make uninformed statements, this is the outcome. It pertains to COVID-19, coronavirus, scientific communication, and Twitter.	1
LESA	993	My father strongly believes that Lysol has the ability to eliminate herpes and the coronavirus. I am exasperated by his claims.	1
LESA	994	Perhaps scientists have not considered the possibility that cocaine could be a remedy for Corona.	1
LESA	995	As long as there is no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus, the grim reality is that any effort to resume normal public activities will inevitably involve sacrificing some lives.	1
LESA	996	If the Chinese government stops consuming live animals like mice, bats, snakes, and tadpoles, and refrains from stealing coronavirus samples for their bioweapons lab in Wuhan, then they may receive better treatment from others.	1
LESA	997	A message on WhatsApp claims that Methylxanthine, Theobromine, and Theophylline, which are found in tea, can treat Coronavirus. Therefore, consuming tea can potentially cure the virus.	1

LESA	1002	The Nixon Foundation had predicted in 1987 that Donald Trump would emerge victorious in any future political campaigns he pursued, as per a photo shared by the Archives Foundation on Twitter. The tweet also included a picture of President-elect Trump.	1
LESA	1003	Glen Thomas was killed when MH17 was shot down, as he was about to reveal the intentional use of FALSE POSITIVE testing for viruses in the bioweapon psyop of COVID-19.	1
LESA	1004	Although it recommends children receive the flu shot as usual, the article does not suggest that it provides protection against coronavirus. Instead, it claims that vaccinating children is the best way to protect older individuals against bacterial pneumonia. However, this assertion is questionable since the flu shot is designed to protect against viruses, not bacteria.	1
LESA	1005	We have vaccines for common flu and pneumonia, but not for COVID-19. The only reason the situation is not worse is because of stay-at-home orders and social distancing. Do you really want to put an end to these efforts and risk a second wave? @mc2maven @elonmusk	1
LESA	1006	It is believed that LionelMedia originated from a bioweapons laboratory in Wuhan, China, which is also known for producing adrenochrome.	1
LESA	1007	Clinical studies have indicated that chloroquine phosphate, an old antimalarial drug, has demonstrated effectiveness in treating pneumonia associated with COVID-19. The drug offers patients both antiviral and anti-inflammatory benefits.	1
LESA	1008	On October 22, 2018, a photo was shared on Twitter by user @GDAWG1958 showing Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for Governor of Georgia, burning the Georgia State Flag on the front steps of the Georgia Capitol.	1
LESA	1009	How is it acceptable for a propaganda asset of the Chinese Communist Party to participate in White House press briefings? Is she potentially engaging in both spreading false information and plotting assassination? Given the evidence of China's involvement in the COVID-19 pandemic as a form of bioterrorism, it is concerning that Phoenix TV, a known mouthpiece for the CCP, is given access to such important events.	1
LESA	1010	Mr. President, the issue at hand is your ability to lead. Continuously spraying to cure those who are already infected is not a viable solution. Instead, focusing your efforts on prevention and control of the epidemic is necessary. Blaming others and neglecting this responsibility will only result in ridicule from the public.	1
LESA	1011	It's interesting that Lysol can kill a strain of the Coronavirus, and I've had this bottle for approximately a year.	1
LESA	1012	On Friday, while visiting the White House, I witnessed the efforts of the administration and health officials to control the spread of coronavirus. I can assure you that the necessary resources are available to safeguard the American population from COVID-19.	1
LESA	1013	The GOP has engaged in illegal stock trading, dismissed the severity of Covid-19 as a hoax, and placed blame on China. They have also attempted to provide bailouts to large corporations without any stipulations. However, they have failed to provide assistance to workers or small businesses, and have not adequately produced enough tests or ventilators.	1
LESA	1014	The NY Federal Reserve and JP Morgan collaborated to create a vaccine against coronavirus and also improved the logistics situation in China.	1
LESA	1015	I am speaking into existence that the coronavirus will pass by mid-April.	1
LESA	1016	China's President Xi Jinping has declared that the country's COVID-19 vaccine will be made available as a global public good, with the aim of ensuring that it is accessible and affordable for developing nations.	1
LESA	1017	The world is currently facing a pandemic, and it is important to be realistic and understand that things cannot go back to normal until a cure is found. It is crucial to not take unnecessary risks and become a statistic. It is important to listen to the advice of experts and prioritize safety.	1
LESA	1018	COVID-19 is a dangerous virus that can be fatal for anyone with pre-existing conditions, not just the elderly. While developing immunity is a positive response from our immune system, it does not mean we cannot spread the virus to others. Seeking assistance is recommended.	1
LESA	1019	Can you assist me in understanding why China should close down wet markets due to the fact that the Wuhan coronavirus originated from monkeys and bats sold there? Additionally, I came across two Google patents, US 2006025785 2A1 and EP0588430B1, which relate to a coronavirus bio-weapon and a coronavirus drug.	1
LESA	1020	I have obtained the cure for COVID-19, which involves the use of Clorox. I am boycotting Trump's briefings on the pandemic vaccine and virus.	1
LESA	1021	There is a belief that someone intentionally released a biological weapon, known as the ChinaVirus, in the United States with the goal of harming President Trump's 2020 election campaign. This theory is supported by those who follow the MAGA, Qanon, and KAGA movements, and is also linked to the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy.	1
LESA	1022	Over the past 5 months, the corona virus outbreak has resulted in the deaths of 3800 individuals globally. In comparison, the flu has caused over 310000 deaths during the same time frame. It is important to question who benefits from this manufactured crisis and to remain vigilant.	1
LESA	1023	Join us in Historic Adel to find a solution for COVID-19 with Alice's UV lamp. In case it doesn't work, we also have some bleach that can be used for gargling.	1
LESA	1024	It is believed that China had knowledge of the corona virus as early as 2015 and may have been responsible for creating this particular strain. There are theories that suggest the virus may have been leaked intentionally for purposes such as population control or as a form of biological warfare during a Cold War.	1
LESA	1025	Absolutely! Using hand sanitizer is not something negative or that people should stay away from. However, claiming that it can kill all bacteria or cure coronavirus, as I saw in a post earlier, is not accurate.	1
LESA	1026	Would you finally start flossing if I claimed that it could cure Coronavirus?	1
LESA	1027	Google and other big tech companies aided in the quarantine, tracking, and elimination of victims of the Chinese bioweapon virus through their prior AI surveillance training and negligent tech transfer. Google has had a presence in China for a long time, offering training and expertise in artificial intelligence to Chinese businesses.	1
LESA	1028	Florida's beaches have remained open and COVID-19 prevention measures have been minimal due to a state of complete dysfunction.	1
LESA	1029	If coronavirus is indeed a product of China's bioweapon program, then China has endangered the entire human race.	1
LESA	1030	Although some people are falsely claiming that CBD can cure or prevent the coronavirus, it can aid in reducing anxiety and inflammation caused by excessive cortisol levels due to high stress, leading to a stress-free life. Here are four CBD oils that can help.	1
LESA	1031	Monash University's research has brought good news regarding the control and cure of Covid-19. They have discovered that a single dose of ivermectin can effectively stop and kill the coronavirus. I recommend that Dr. Harsh Vardhan examine the viability and feasibility of this drug. This information has been shared with MPLodha and iGopalShetty.	1

LESA	1034	According to @va_shiva, if Coronavirus was caused by immune-system suppression, then Indian slums and the Amazon forest should make humans more immune to viruses. However, this is not true.	1
LESA	1035	Dr. Sanjay Gupta's latest update on Covid-19 propaganda states that there is currently no cure for the virus, and consuming vitamin C or garlic does not provide any help. The only solution is to wait for a vaccine, and in the meantime, the most effective measure is to maintain good hygiene practices.	1
LESA	1036	If China had been concealing information about the coronavirus and it was more deadly, we would have seen evidence of this by now, as there have been around 50 cases outside of China with no fatalities. It is important to note that viruses are prone to mutation, with the simplest mutations allowing them to evade the immune system, while more complex mutations require the development of new abilities.	1
LESA	1037	Fox News has been banned in New Zealand and Australia due to its propaganda and lack of compatibility with their democracies. These countries are considered smart for taking this action, while the United States is viewed as sinking under the dictatorship of Trump and the Republicans, according to Bonnie Swadling's tweet on January 25, 2018.	1
LESA	1038	The police have been informed that certain milkshakes thrown during the protest today may have contained fast-drying cement. They are urging anyone who was hit with any substance during the demonstration to report it to the authorities.	1
LESA	1039	Despite the straightforward solution of hand washing, people are reluctant to do so due to the proliferation of false information about the origins of the virus, unproven remedies, and the study of diseases.	1
LESA	1040	"A new smoothie brand under Trump's name has been suggested, made with Ajax, Lysol, Fantastik, and ginger, claiming to prevent death from Covid-19. However, it is clear that Trump is not fit to be the President of the United States, as he exhibits narcissistic behavior and the principle of ""everything Trump touches dies"" applies."	1
LESA	1041	Although I was making progress, it seems that I may have contracted pneumonia now. While it's not severe, it's still a setback. If my COVID-19 test comes back negative, I'll still be scared to leave my home until this pandemic is over. It's important to stay in quarantine and stay safe.	1
LESA	1042	The @WHO website can help dispel false beliefs about coronavirus and COVID-19. It's important to understand that the virus is not man-made, cannot be cured by sunlight, and is not a hoax. Similar to diseases like smallpox and HPV, a vaccine will eventually be developed and I will be willing to take it. It's crucial to avoid spreading fake news during this time.	1
LESA	1043	@moayush has recommended ancient Ayurveda techniques and measures to boost immunity that can be practiced at home. These are not a cure for Covid-19, but simple steps to maintain good health during the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic.	1
LESA	1044	@uffeelbaek, I hope you stay safe amidst the WuhanPneumonia outbreak and that it doesn't spread to Denmark.	1
LESA	1045	Even in jest, @VancityReynolds would not suggest using @AviationGin as a remedy for coronavirus. While it is a high-quality gin, it does not have curative properties.	1
LESA	1046	The virus is a covert biological weapon that has been developed, and there is speculation about its use in germ warfare. As I had suspected, it was intended to target China.	1
LESA	1047	The president's suggestion that people should consume bleach or inject themselves with light to cure COVID-19, and the vice president's belief that masks also cover the eyes, highlights the danger of having unintelligent individuals in positions of power. Perhaps it's time to reconsider who we entrust with leadership roles. #ncpol	1
LESA	1048	The coronavirus is believed to have been created in a Chinese bio weapon lab and intentionally released by the Chinese Communist Party as a form of biological terrorism. Additionally, a Chinese scientist has been caught attempting to bring MERS and SARS into the US. China is being held responsible for these actions.	1
LESA	1049	Despite Trump's claims that hydroxychloroquine is a cure for Covid-19, it is important to not believe the hype and remain skeptical. The situation with Covid-19 and the current president is beyond parody.	1
LESA	1050	"What is the meaning of ""if it's serious""? The person in question was not tested for COVID-19, but the medical professionals were fairly certain that she had it. As a result, she is not included in the official count, and the CDC has ceased updating their records. She was advised to return if she develops pneumonia, but this could potentially put others at risk. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident."	1
LESA	1051	Clinical trials of a coronavirus vaccine have been launched by China and the US.	1
LESA	1052	The coronavirus does not affect evil.	1
LESA	1053	Is it true that China intentionally spread the nC19 virus as a form of biowarfare? And is it also true that the virus only spread in Wuhan and Hubei, and not in other parts of China? These claims need to be investigated and verified. Should we consider relocating factories that China has installed in other countries, reducing imports from China, and supporting the independence of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Bhutan? It may also be necessary to impose international restrictions on China, with the involvement of the POTUS and the UN.	1
LESA	1054	A US group is claiming that the coronavirus is a bioweapon and is suing China for $20 trillion. This is the latest update on the coronavirus pandemic.	1

LESA	1057	At the daily briefings, Lysol eliminates both the coronavirus and Trump.	1
LESA	1058	I am questioning why the government is enforcing a StayAtHome order due to the danger of the coronavirus, yet homeless individuals who use drugs are seemingly immune to it.	1
LESA	1059	Undoubtedly, a successful COVID-19 vaccine is on the horizon.	1
LESA	1060	Can't we just inject Clorox to cure COVID-19? It can't be worse than the virus itself, right?	1
LESA	1061	The wearing of clown masks is set to be prohibited in the United States, and those caught wearing one could face a fine of $50,000, according to a report by @thehuzlers, as tweeted by @sweet_legacy on October 7, 2016.	1

LESA	1072	In Peru and Indonesia, some individuals are killing bats due to Chinese propaganda spread by the country's controlled official media, which is influenced by the Satanic Elite. These people believe that bats and other animals are responsible for the COVID-19 virus, rather than it being a man-made bioweapon created in a laboratory. This belief is untrue and those who spread it are being dishonest.	1
LESA	1073	The statement made by YS Jagan, the CM of Andhra Pradesh, regarding the coronavirus is both irresponsible and misleading to the public. He referred to it as nothing more than a fever (Jvaram) and claimed that it can easily be cured with medication and a little caution. This is a dangerous message to spread as it downplays the severity of the virus and could lead to people not taking necessary precautions to prevent its spread.	1

However, it has been proven that the global spread was engineered by China, and that China preemptively imported masks from abroad and provided defective medical equipment in the second phase of their plan. Some have even suggested that it was a form of biowarfare.	0
LESA	2028	Last year, Hanbin collaborated with the same business group that assisted him in obtaining masks for COVID-19 to offer his services as a volunteer at a children's center. During the Christmas parties held at the center, he dressed up as Santa Claus, and this heartwarming gesture has left me feeling emotional.	0

LESA	2034	This morning, while having breakfast, I overheard a group of baby boomers discussing the coronavirus. They were claiming that it was a hoax and that only one person had died in the US. Their conversation was identical to the disinformation spread by the GOP. It's concerning that we are not adequately prepared for this situation.	0
LESA	2035	Could it be that the solution to the coronavirus outbreak is a combination of toilet paper, bottled water, and soup? Some people seem to think so, as they stock up on these items amidst the coronapocalypse. With many areas implementing food quarantine measures and advising people to stay home and chill, it feels like a state of emergency. And with Friday the 13th adding to the eerie atmosphere, the rush for toiletpaper continues.	0
LESA	2036	The most distressing aspect of the corona virus epidemic is not the illness and death it causes, but rather the way it exposes the worst aspects of human nature. This includes ignorance, prejudice, fear, finger-pointing, arrogance, and complacency, all manifesting simultaneously.	0
LESA	2037	The messages are not mixed, but rather being weaponized for political gain by individuals such as yourself and your brother, Fredo.	0
LESA	2038	Hello Angela, I hope you are doing well and staying safe. I have read the information you shared, but I cannot say that Ebola and Coronavirus are identical.

These gift sets can be shipped anywhere in the United States.	0
LESA	2053	Watch this video of a hospital in Spain, and then watch it again with the volume turned up.

LESA	2054	I hope that environmentalists will heal themselves by breathing in fresh air instead of relying on medication.	0
LESA	2055	Japan has closed schools, Italy has closed schools and football games, and China has shut everything down due to the Coronavirus. The Olympics may be cancelled.

LESA	2067	If the coronavirus were to result in a catastrophic event like the Thanos Snap, wiping out half of the world's population, we would likely reminisce about our current state of blissful ignorance and miss the people and moments we have now, including this tweet. This situation is reminiscent of the plot of Marvel's Endgame, and some speculate that the virus may have been a deliberate bio-weapon created in China.

LESA	2074	As it is Friday, it is likely that @realDonaldTrump is once again being dishonest. Despite his claims, @POTUS has not managed to halt the spread of the CoronavirusOutbreak, which has now reached 21 states and infected over 225 people in the US. Unfortunately, due to a lack of test kits, we are unable to effectively contain the virus and track its spread.	0

These patients have tested negative for the flu, have recently traveled, and work in airports. However, they are not being allowed to undergo testing. As a result, they are returning to work without a confirmed diagnosis because they cannot afford to take time off. Other emergency room doctors have reported similar cases.	0
LESA	2101	"Covid 19, also known as the Plandemic of 2019/2020, is a situation where the cure is worse than the disease, assuming there is a disease. It is referred to as ""year zero"" on the NWO calendar. There is something amiss with this scenario, can you identify what it is?"	0

LESA	2121	A compelling image is circulating that demonstrates how self-isolating not only shields you from infection but also interrupts the transmission of the virus through social networks.
