I am writing to inform you that I have decided not to receive the Covid vaccine and I am also declining the use of vaccine passports. I understand that this may cause some inconvenience, but I have carefully considered my options and have decided that this is the best decision for me.

I believe that everyone should have the right to make their own decisions about their health and wellbeing, and I do not feel comfortable with the idea of being forced to take a vaccine or carry a passport in order to participate in certain activities or access certain services.

I understand that there may be some risks associated with not receiving the vaccine, but I am willing to take those risks and rely on other measures such as social distancing and wearing a mask to protect myself and others.

I hope that you can respect my decision and that we can continue to work together in a safe and productive manner.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]"	0
