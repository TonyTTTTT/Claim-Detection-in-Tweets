LESA	2136	Confidence is displayed when one labels others as unintelligent, even after advising people to inject themselves with disinfectant as a remedy for #COVID19. https://t.co/S3WMwdolwI	0

LESA	2138	Even if President Trump were to develop a cure for COVID-19, those suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome would likely reject it, saying 'not my cure'. They label us as a cult, but in reality, we are a family. The Trump team is a dynasty, and this dynasty is set to secure his re-election. #Landslide2020	0

LESA	2140	The sentiment that some Democrats wish for everyone at CPAC to succumb to the coronavirus is a prime example of why they should not be victorious in the November elections. Such attitudes are malevolent.	0

The mask acts as a barrier, preventing your droplets from entering the air that others breathe in.	0
LESA	2146	I'm extremely fearful of the coronavirus. Honestly, my immune system is not strong enough to protect me.	0
LESA	2147	It appears that the coronavirus disproportionately affects black people and I'm indifferent to that https://t.co/CMwiAIeaz6	0
