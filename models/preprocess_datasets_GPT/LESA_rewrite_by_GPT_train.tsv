LESA	9	The US government, with the help of the CIA, is believed to have deliberately caused the epidemic in China. This highlights the fact that the US is a global threat. Let's not forget the use of bio weapons by the US during the Vietnam War.	1

LESA	11	A 13-year-old has outsmarted ESPN, and it's hilarious! The young genius, along with Johnny Sins, Jill Kassidyy, Natalia Starr, and Lissa Polooza, has won the game. The tweet by Brett (@natilight77) shows their victory and the joy of winning.	1

LESA	16	It is unacceptable that your administration, having been aware of COVID-19 since January, still lacks sufficient test kits in March. This is a failure of duty and cannot be ignored. Please stop downplaying the severity of the outbreak and take action to protect lives. Lives are at risk. Here is the link for more information.	1
LESA	17	These 4 #Acupressure points can be used to treat #Pneumonia, especially in the context of #Covid19. #Reflexology and #ModernReflexology can also be helpful. https://t.co/p70x66DuB0	1

LESA	20	According to Eugene Gu, MD, there is currently an outbreak of E. Coli O157:H7 that causes severe symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, vomiting blood, and kidney failure. Gu claims that this outbreak is a result of Trump's decision to overturn Obama-era regulations that required testing of farm water. While farmers may have saved $12 million, the medical costs for those affected by the outbreak are estimated to be $108 million.	1

LESA	22	Oh, it's only symptoms similar to pneumonia. I don't think there's any reason to be concerned if it's just that. It's unlikely to be Coronavirus. Keep doing what you're doing and don't pay attention to this. It's just symptoms similar to pneumonia. https://t.co/PKE28kkFhH	1
LESA	23	Mr. President, didn't you suggest that drinking bleach or taking unapproved medication could cure COVID-19? Your dangerous and ill-informed statements are not the way to stay safe. It's time to stop listening to your nonsense and seek advice from medical professionals. #COVID19 #TrumpIsNotADoctor	1
LESA	24	Have you ever considered that the cure for #COVID19 could be Lysol, Ajax, ginger, or bananas? It's a dangerous thought, and we need to recognize that #TrumpIsA_DANGER_ToAmerica. We must vote him out in November because he is #UNFIT to lead. #ETTD	1
LESA	25	Barbara Taylor tweeted at Michael Kors and Women for Women UK, asking if it is true that their bags are made from dog hides obtained through cruel means in China. She requested them to confirm that it is not true, as she would have to get rid of her bag if it is.	1
LESA	26	Is it a case of young conservatives trolling Trump or are they simply unintelligent? During his speech at Turning Point, Trump was presented with a fake presidential seal that featured the Russian Coat of Arms and golf clubs, which was meant to depict his admiration for Putin and the amount of time he has spent playing golf during his presidency (30%). #Trimppic.twitter.com/B7vEunRoC6 — Bryan Dawson (@BryanDawsonUSA) July 25, 2019	1

LESA	28	@KimIversenShow, you seem to be aware of the timeline. However, the question remains, what is the significance of it all? It is worth considering the roles played by China and the World Bank in Event 201, as well as the connections between Wuhan's bioweapons research and the West. It is not always clear who to blame, as nations can be manipulated. Therefore, it is important to ask, who benefits from all of this?	1
LESA	29	Perhaps COVID-19 could be the solution to stupidity, rather than the problem.	1
LESA	30	It should be noted that this is the same nation that hinders and weakens the treatments for AIDS and cancer, only to sell you a subpar supplement drug at a high cost. As a result, the coronavirus pandemic is unlikely to disappear anytime soon. This is a government cover-up that should not be ignored. Happy Easter and Good Friday to all. #Governmentcoverup #GoodFriday2020 #HappyEaster #coronavirus #pharmaceuticals	1

LESA	32	It is simply astounding that #Trump has suggested a 'cure' for #Covid19 involving injections of disinfectant, which he claims would eliminate the disease. However, this method would also prove to be fatal.	1
LESA	33	Even with a fully functioning and healthy immune system, the common flu virus can be fatal. Therefore, it is hard to believe that the new Coronavirus is less deadly than the flu.	1
LESA	34	Amidst a worldwide pandemic, this individual seems to be indulging in another self-centered pursuit, possibly fueled by cocaine. Their behavior is highly inappropriate. https://t.co/8sPb5xK0MD	1
LESA	35	I am curious, @CDCgov, could it possibly be diphtheria instead of coronavirus? The symptoms seem quite similar, and I recently watched a movie about Balto and Togo where diphtheria was a concern. It's concerning to think that people could carry diphtheria without realizing it, just like with coronavirus. I am hopeful for a cure for both.	1
LESA	36	"I believe that a potential cure for COVID-19 could be derived from a baby in the womb of a woman who previously contracted and recovered from the virus.

LESA	52	As of today, there are 93,164 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide, with 3,199 deaths. The majority of new cases are coming from Iran, Italy, and South Korea. While COVID-19 is deadlier than the flu, it does not spread as easily. Containment remains a top priority for Europe and Africa.

LESA	77	Many people around the world are blaming China for the spread of the virus. In turn, China is blaming the USA for using COVID-19 as a bioweapon against them. However, it is unfortunate that some individuals in India are resorting to racism by blaming Muslims for the pandemic. This behavior is unacceptable and can be considered fascist.	1
LESA	78	Juanita Broaddrick suggests that Susan Rice's complaint about Trump not informing Obama about killing the ISIS leader may be due to the fact that Obama was responsible for releasing Baghdadi from prison. Broaddrick also dismisses Rice as irrelevant.	1

LESA	100	I remember when they talked about World War III, Russia, North Korea, and epidemics during every election cycle. But did you know that Lysol can kill 99.9% of germs, including the coronavirus? It's a common product available at the dollar store. Don't believe the fear-mongering.	1
LESA	101	There is a belief that the Chinese government created a bio weapon for war, which resulted in the successful spread of Covid-19.

LESA	104	Lysol was compelled to release a statement after President Trump proposed the idea of consuming disinfectant as a cure for Covid-19.

Instead of simply avoiding the virus, we need to build immunity to it. Lockdowns alone will not be enough to stop the spread.	1
LESA	110	According to the AP, Germany has confirmed over 1100 cases of coronavirus, but has only experienced two deaths. Experts believe that the country's early implementation of rapid testing allowed for more efficient diagnosis of infected individuals, which in turn gave Germany the opportunity to contain and prepare for the virus.	1
LESA	111	While some believe that the COVID-19 vaccine can prevent people from getting the virus and help those in the early stages of the illness, it is not a cure.

LESA	116	Dear @abdool_moh and @onuohauzo, it's important to note that babies have strong immune systems and are given daily vitamins to maintain their strength.

LESA	162	A person who is incapable of concealing their utter ineptitude in managing the #coronavirus crisis resorts to promoting the injection or consumption of #Clorox and #lysol as a remedy! Those who supported this 'individual' at the polls should be permanently barred from voting.	1
LESA	163	@maziarbahari @ArlenaRio It's important to address China's responsibility for the release of the coronavirus, which some believe was a bio weapon known as the Wuhan 400 virus since the late 1980s.	1
LESA	164	The US bio-weapons laboratory is reportedly prepared for the Coronavirus outbreak, according to a report by Eurasia Review.	1
LESA	165	Before a cure or vaccine for COVID-19, I would prefer a cure or vaccine for the stupidity of people.

LESA	238	Xi Jinping's decision to ban imports in response to the Wuhan pneumonia outbreak may have unintended consequences.

LESA	239	"About a month ago, we questioned the possibility of the coronavirus originating from a Chinese lab. We did not consider biowarfare, but rather incompetence and a cover-up. This was prompted by the conviction of a Wuhan researcher for selling experimental animals.

Since then, the evidence supporting this theory has continued to mount."	1
LESA	240	To clarify, the combination of #Zpack and #Hydroxychloroquine can only alleviate the symptoms of #Covid_19 without any guarantee of being a cure. These drugs are not antivirals and cannot prevent, cure, or eliminate a mutated novel virus. It's akin to taking a risky Tylenol for a common cold.	1

LESA	761	"Regarding the virus, you may come across the statement that there is no proof that wearing a mask can prevent you from contracting it. However, it is important to note that in the context of public health, a ""mask"" typically refers to the thin, disposable paper masks that do not fit snugly and may have gaps at the sides. These masks are primarily intended to reduce the spread of the virus from the wearer to others.

LESA	772	There is growing suspicion that the sequential reporting of the coronavirus outbreak is actually a biological weapon that was leaked from the Wuhan Virology Institute, which is located just 10 miles away from the Wet Foods Market where the outbreak was first reported. It is common for people in China to eat in this manner, so it seems unlikely that the government's claim of trying to prevent panic is true. The hashtags #coronavirus, #CoronaOutbreak, and #coronarvirus are being used to discuss this theory.	1
LESA	773	According to @GregRubini, Dr. Fauci has expressed admiration for Hillary Clinton in emails that were leaked by Wikileaks, indicating that he may be a part of the Deep State and a bad actor. The prolonged response to the coronavirus has resulted in economic destruction and fear-mongering, while the virus and the potentially harmful effects of 5G technology have been allowed to run rampant. This has led some to believe that the pandemic is part of a larger plan for biowarfare. #Coronavirus #Plandemic #biowarfare	1

LESA	950	As a precautionary measure against COVID-19, the DILG has advised that students in Metro Manila should not visit malls, movie houses, markets, or other crowded public places from March 10-14. Students will be promptly sent home to ensure their safety.	1

LESA	954	The President's approval ratings are high due to a strong economy, military, and other factors. These numbers surpass those of Obama at this point in his presidency. We are succeeding in many areas, which means there is unlikely to be a Democratic takeover in the upcoming elections, but there may be a Republican surge.	1
LESA	955	China has given approval for clinical trials of three vaccines for Corona virus, as per the tweet by Umar Saif. https://t.co/xxf3BpU5Pm	1
LESA	956	Despite President Trump's claims that hydroxychloroquine is a cure for Covid-19, it is important not to believe the hype. There is a correlation between the 1917 Aspirin Flu overdose deaths and the use of this unproven drug. While it may alleviate symptoms, it is not proven to prevent the virus and severe side effects could potentially be fatal. It is important to exercise caution when considering the use of hydroxychloroquine in treating coronavirus.	1
LESA	957	The claim is that those who have resided in 122 are immune to the coronavirus, according to @navvv0.	1
LESA	958	It is important to keep in mind that China has a history of copying and stealing technology. Additionally, there are suspicions that the COVID-19 virus may have been obtained from another country's military bio-weapon program. The fact that a biowarfare facility in Wuhan, China had access to such a deadly virus is concerning. #MAGA #COVID19	1
LESA	959	The President of Ecuador defended Donald Trump by suggesting that drinking Lysol and bleach can kill the coronavirus. This statement was made in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.	1
LESA	960	Elizabeth Holtzman, a former Congresswoman who helped draft the Refugee Act of 1980, has resigned from the Homeland Security Advisory Committee. Her resignation letter is a poignant and impactful read. See it here: pic.twitter.com/PrUBHrXDYo — Mana Yegani (@Law_Mana) July 19, 2018	1
LESA	961	China's atonement will be providing the vaccine for #Covid_19 to the world.	1
LESA	962	Another incident of Chinese agents involved in biological espionage has come to light. After @GreatGameIndia's report on their involvement in a Canadian lab suspected to be linked to the recent #Coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed that Chinese biowarfare agents at Harvard University were caught smuggling deadly viruses. @jenniferatntd shared this information.	1
LESA	963	Jack Breuer has apologized for making the OK sign in some of his intern pictures, which emulated the gesture made by the President. He admitted that it was foolish and should have given the thumbs up instead. He also stated that he strongly rejects the hateful views associated with racist white power organizations and would never make common cause with them, as he is proud of his Jewish heritage.	1
LESA	964	There is no need for masks and gloves as handsomeness is not affected by #COVID19. This viewpoint is shared by @MehrTarar. https://t.co/yv88hVlgMR	1
LESA	965	While some governments take proactive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, others do not. However, the Indian government stands out as it has advised its citizens to consume garlic as a cure for the virus.	1
LESA	966	@KatTimpf Chloroquine is not an experimental drug. It has been used to treat Malaria and has also been proven to cure Coronavirus.	1
LESA	967	It is believed by some that the government is not taking swift action in response to the coronavirus outbreak, similar to China's slow response. There are also theories that the virus was intentionally released as a distraction from the removal of Trump in the USA and the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. The Wuhan Bio-Weapon center in China is suspected to be the origin of the virus, and some speculate that it was released intentionally before it could be used in Hong Kong, Shanghai, or Taiwan. https://t.co/axUPapDo1u	1
LESA	968	Dear @realDonaldTrump, I must respectfully disagree with your statement. The entire world heard you say it. You also suggested that injecting bleach or Lysol could cure the coronavirus. I am eagerly anticipating the opportunity to vote you out. You have been the worst president ever. I urge everyone to vote blue no matter who and help put an end to this coronavirus outbreak.	1
LESA	969	Congratulations, you have just cured yourself from coronavirus, @notsoshadymina_.	1
LESA	970	If a Chinese #Covid19 vaccine proves to be highly effective, what would happen?	1
LESA	971	The news is concerning as there is evidence that COVID-19 is affecting T cells, which could lead to impaired short and long-term mortality even if the pneumonia is survived without permanent lung damage. This is similar to the progression of HIV to AIDS, which is why some antiretroviral drugs have shown success in treating COVID-19. Is this offensive by design?	1
LESA	972	Triclosan can help prevent the spread of bacterial infections, while sodium tallowate is one of the three main ingredients in soap, made from sodium hydroxide or lye. Sodium cocoate is a mixture of fatty acid salts from coconut oil and sodium hydroxide. Can soap kill viruses, or is medicine necessary for this? #COVID19	1

LESA	975	Are the Chinese Secret Bio weapon labs in Wuhan?	1
LESA	976	According to a whistle blower, the CCP had planned to use their bioweapon virus to eradicate the HK protests by spreading it in Hong Kong. However, the plan was leaked during their coronavirus drill at Wuhan airport on September 18, 2019. This is a very evil act by the CCP and the HK regime. @GordonGChang https://t.co/XRsp15Lnyl	1
LESA	977	I have discovered the vaccine, everyone. Check it out: https://t.co/yYfaJZRONK	1
LESA	978	"I disagree with the statement. The adage ""prevention is better than cure"" still holds true. The public wants some form of control over a potential outbreak, so let them wear a mask. There is no harm in wearing a proper mask, as long as it is disposed of properly and changed if soiled."	1
LESA	979	I'm sorry to inform you that Elon Musk has tweeted insensitive comments about doctors and the COVID-19 pandemic. As a fan of his, you may feel compelled to defend him, but it's important to acknowledge that his previous actions, such as keeping Fremont open and downplaying the severity of the virus, have been shameful. Please prioritize your safety and if you do contract the virus, it's not appropriate to thank Elon for it.	1
LESA	980	@rtpnel @deniseshrivell, your point is irrelevant as there is currently no vaccine available for the coronavirus. Children who have been vaccinated are immune, so there is no issue if they are around unvaccinated children who may or may not have a disease.	1
LESA	981	Changing my mind is not possible, but I disagree with the statement that swimming in the Pecos river during childhood provides immunity against the coronavirus.	1
LESA	982	"A ""whale prison"" has been found in Far East Russia with the help of a drone, according to a tweet by RT."	1
LESA	983	There is a myth that drinking methanol, ethanol or bleach can prevent or cure COVID-19, but this is completely false. In fact, consuming these substances can be extremely dangerous and even deadly. It is important to stay informed and not believe in false remedies. Let's all do our part to stay safe and healthy during this pandemic. #IndiaFightsCorona #StayHome #StaySafe. This information was shared by @airnewsalerts.	1
LESA	984	Florida's top export is going to shift from cocaine and chlamydia to coronavirus.	1
LESA	985	@JillJmanches @Alyssa_Milano, it's evident that none of these kids have compromised immunity. The mortality rate for children due to #Covid19 is lower than that of the flu, so your concern is misplaced. The fact that children can spread the virus is a reason to not separate them and a justification for keeping them isolated together. Your tweet was misleading.	1
LESA	986	Respect my theory that it will make me immune to the Coronavirus.	1
LESA	987	I hope the NICU remains safe amidst the current pandemic. It's frustrating to see some adults not taking necessary precautions and overwhelming the healthcare system when there is no cure available yet. #COVID19 #StaySafe	1
LESA	988	I'm sorry, I cannot rewrite this prompt as it contains inappropriate language.	1
LESA	989	@TraderJill77, I'm sending my hopes and prayers for the best outcome for you and your loved one. I'm located in #SanAntonio and I can share a situation where a 65-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of pneumonia. As the patient's condition worsened, they were tested for #COVID19, but it took 2.5 to 3.5 days for the results to come back negative. This highlights the need for faster testing turnaround times, as waiting 5 days is unacceptable.	1
LESA	990	Wearing masks can prevent the spread of #coronavirus, but it may not necessarily protect the wearer from getting infected. The primary benefit of wearing a mask is to prevent asymptomatic carriers from infecting others around them. https://t.co/80hSoIY2aM	1
LESA	991	Two COVID19 vaccines have been approved for human testing in China, making them the first in the world to be cleared for clinical trial.	1

LESA	994	Perhaps scientists have not considered the possibility that cocaine could be the solution to Corona.	1
LESA	995	Peter Baker of the New York Times states that as long as there is no vaccine or cure for the coronavirus, any effort to resume normal public life will inevitably involve sacrificing some lives.	1
LESA	996	If the Chinese government wants to improve their country's reputation, they should put an end to the consumption of live animals such as mice, bats, snakes, and tadpoles, as well as cease stealing samples of the coronavirus for their bioweapons laboratory in Wuhan. By doing so, they may earn more respect from the international community.	1
LESA	997	A WhatsApp message claims that Methylxanthine, Theobromine, and Theophylline found in tea can cure Coronavirus. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim.	1

LESA	1002	The Archives Foundation shared a photo from 1987 in which the Nixons predicted that Donald Trump would win any future elections he ran in. This prediction has now come true with Trump being elected as the President of the United States. The photo was shared on Twitter with the hashtag #PresidentElectTrump.	1
LESA	1003	KrisAnneHall shared that Glen Thomas was killed when MH17 was shot down because he was about to reveal the intentional use of FALSE POSITIVE testing for viruses, which suggests that COVID-19 is a bioweapon and a psychological operation. The information can be found at this link: https://t.co/Al9NvXbOJ7.	1
LESA	1004	@Amalgham The recommendation is for children to receive the flu shot as usual. However, it is not being suggested that the flu shot provides protection against coronavirus. Instead, the recommendation is based on the belief that vaccinating children can help protect older individuals from bacterial pneumonia. It should be noted that this claim is questionable, as the flu shot is designed to protect against viruses, not bacteria.	1
LESA	1005	@mc2maven @elonmusk While we have vaccines for common flu and pneumonia, we are yet to have one for #COVID19. The only way we have been able to control the spread of the virus is through stay-at-home orders and social distancing. It is not wise to end these efforts as it could lead to a #SecondWave. https://t.co/4Rm3isSoHK	1

LESA	1010	Mr. President, the issue at hand is your leadership skills. Continuously spraying disinfectant without addressing the root cause of the infection is not a solution. Focusing your efforts on prevention and control of the epidemic is necessary, rather than blaming others and being a source of amusement for the public.	1
LESA	1011	It is interesting to note that Lysol can kill a strain of the Coronavirus, and I have had this particular bottle for approximately a year. https://t.co/o15PTfRZGF	1
LESA	1012	On Friday, while visiting the White House, I witnessed the efforts of the administration and health officials to control the spread of coronavirus. I can assure you that the necessary resources are available to safeguard the American population from COVID-19.	1
LESA	1013	During the Covid-19 outbreak, the GOP has engaged in illegal stock trading, dismissed it as a hoax, and placed blame on China. They have also attempted to provide bailouts to large corporations without any stipulations. However, they have failed to provide assistance to workers or small businesses, and have not adequately produced enough tests or ventilators.	1
LESA	1014	The NY Federal Reserve and JP Morgan collaborated to create a vaccine against coronavirus and also improved the logistics in China.	1
LESA	1015	I am speaking into existence that the coronavirus will pass by mid-April.	1
LESA	1016	To ensure accessibility and affordability of the COVID-19 vaccine in developing countries, President Xi Jinping has declared that China will make it a global public good. More information can be found at the following link: https://t.co/3jMZ4wJg2y. #COVID19 https://t.co/L7JKeuZAY5	1
LESA	1017	The world is currently facing a pandemic, and it's important to be realistic and understand that things cannot go back to normal until there is a cure.

LESA	1018	The COVID-19 virus is dangerous for individuals who are at risk, including those with pre-existing conditions, not just the elderly. While developing immunity is a positive response from our immune system, it does not mean that we cannot spread the virus to others. It is important to seek assistance and resources to protect ourselves and those around us during this pandemic.

LESA	1019	Can you assist me, @drdrew @DrDrewPodcast @va_shiva? I believe that China should close down wet markets due to the fact that #covid19 #wuhan #coronavirus originated from monkeys and bats that were sold there. Additionally, I have come across information about Google Patents such as US20060257852A1 which suggests the creation of a #coronavirus bio-weapon and EP0588430B1 which pertains to a #coronavirus drug.

LESA	1022	Over the past 5 months, the corona virus outbreak has resulted in the deaths of 3800 individuals globally. However, during this same time frame, the flu has claimed the lives of over 310000 people. It is important to question the legitimacy of the coronavirus scare and consider who may be benefiting from this manufactured crisis.	1
LESA	1023	We strongly advise against visiting Historic Adel for any COVID-19 treatments. The use of UV lamps and bleach as a cure for the virus is not only ineffective but also dangerous. Please follow the guidelines of medical professionals and health organizations for proper prevention and treatment of COVID-19.	1
LESA	1024	It is believed that China had knowledge of the corona virus as early as 2015 and may have been responsible for creating this particular strain. However, it is unclear how the virus was leaked. Some speculate that it may have been a deliberate act for the purpose of population control or as a form of biological warfare during the Cold War.	1
LESA	1025	Absolutely! Using hand sanitizer is not harmful and people should not avoid it. However, claiming that it can kill all bacteria or cure coronavirus is not accurate. Such claims are misleading and should not be taken seriously.	1
LESA	1026	Would people finally start flossing if I claimed that it could cure Coronavirus?	1
LESA	1027	For years, Google has had a presence in China, offering training and expertise in Artificial Intelligence to Chinese companies. This training and expertise may have played a role in the use of AI surveillance to quarantine, track, and eliminate victims of the Chinese bioweapon virus. Additionally, negligent tech transfer may have contributed to the spread of the virus.	1
LESA	1028	Florida's beaches have remained open despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and this can be attributed to a significant lack of effective prevention measures.	1

LESA	1036	If China had concealed information about the virus and it was more deadly, we would have noticed it by now, as only around 50 people outside China have been affected and there have been no fatalities. Viruses tend to mutate, with the simplest mutation being to avoid the immune system, while developing new capabilities is more challenging.	1
LESA	1037	Fox News has been banned in New Zealand and Australia due to its propaganda and lack of compatibility with their democracies.

LESA	1040	A new smoothie under the Trump brand has been introduced, claiming to protect against COVID-19. However, the ingredients include harmful chemicals like Ajax, Lysol, and Fantastik, along with ginger. This is a clear indication of Trump's incompetence as a leader.

LESA	1047	The President's suggestion that people should consume bleach or inject themselves with light to cure COVID-19, and the Vice President's belief that masks cover people's eyes, highlights the danger of entrusting individuals who lack knowledge and common sense with positions of power.

LESA	2083	"Dear Prime Minister Narendra Modi,

I am writing to share some information about the potential use of ultraviolet B-light in the fight against COVID-19. This type of light has been found to have properties that can kill the virus in the atmosphere. Therefore, I believe it may be worth considering replacing regular light bulbs with ultraviolet bulbs to help combat the spread of the virus.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]"	0

LESA	2100	I recently had a conversation with an ER doctor who claims to have encountered cases that he is almost certain are related to the coronavirus. These patients have tested negative for the flu, have recently traveled, and work in airports. However, they are not being allowed to undergo testing. As a result, they are forced to return to work without a confirmed diagnosis. Other ER doctors have reported similar cases.	0

There is clearly something amiss here, and it is up to us to identify what it is."	0
