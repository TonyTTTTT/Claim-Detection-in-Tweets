To prepare for COVID-19, it is essential to develop a plan for home-based actions. Start by selecting a room in your home that can be used to isolate sick household members from those who are healthy. This will help prevent the spread of the virus within your household.

Next, take steps to protect yourself and others. This includes practicing good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and avoiding close contact with others. Additionally, consider wearing a mask when in public or around others who may be sick.

To learn more about creating a household plan of action for COVID-19, seek out reliable sources of information, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or your local health department.
