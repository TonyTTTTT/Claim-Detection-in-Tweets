LESA	2183	HydroxyChloroquine is a heavy dose. No one should do any misadventure. However, people can try homeopathic preventive medicines or immune boosting medicine of Ayurveda like GILOY/guloncho juice, Papaya leaf juice etc. These are not medicine to cure coronavirus but may benefit.	1
LESA	2184	Maybe in trouble:) Using the horoscope from LFPress to help plan my day. However, it did say I should distance myself from unpredictable and unrealistic people.
