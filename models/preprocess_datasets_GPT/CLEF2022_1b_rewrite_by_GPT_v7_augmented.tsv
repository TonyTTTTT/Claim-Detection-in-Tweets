COVID-19	6142	War against Covid-19 is closer to the geopolitical front, a clear declaration of war on the unchallenged power of big pharmaceutical companies. This means the United States is behind Pfizer and Moderna. The countries that control the production of vaccines now hold the fate of the world in their hands.	0
COVID-19	6143	@realJeff45 @Jord_45 This COVID-19 is nothing more than a bad flu. The real dangers lie in all these untested, unproven, and no idea of long-term effects from the vaccines. People are dropping dead within a day or two after receiving the shot. 98% recovery rate after infection. I'll take those odds!	1
COVID-19	6144	I received the second dose of Pfizer's COVID vaccine three days ago and am pleased to report that I experienced no side effects other than slight soreness in the arm where the injection was administered.	1
COVID-19	6145	@SaudiMOH I am a Kenyan teaching in Jeddah. I applied for the Covid-19 vaccine on January 15 and I haven't received a message yet. When I check on the app, it says pending, while people who applied recently are already receiving their vaccines. Please assist.	1
COVID-19	6146	We are still learning how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19. After you have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you should continue to take precautions in public places, such as wearing a mask, maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others, and avoiding crowds.	0
COVID-19	6147	My elderly parents received their first Covid-19 vaccine shots this week. I am so thankful and relieved. A BIG shout out to the Fearless Frontline who researched, tested, developed, produced, delivered, scheduled, and administered these life-saving vaccines.	1
COVID-19	6148	According to an analysis by Kaiser Health News, Black Americans are receiving COVID-19 vaccines at a much lower rate than white Americans, despite being hospitalized and killed at a disproportionately higher rate by the coronavirus.	1
COVID-19	6149	No more COVID-19 talk, we have the vaccines, they are in the arms. Please lift the curfew, Holness. Since the World Health Organization and other global organizations are authorities for Jamaica, they said to tell you that curfews don't work. Please purchase NATO's vaccine for crime and ditch the cute Major for an import.	0
COVID-19	6150	When other continents were working day and night and spending billions of dollars to develop vaccines, African countries were soundly sleeping or busy denying that Covid-19 exists. Let's face it, Africa must prioritize research and development and get out of the 'independence' comfort zone.	1
COVID-19	6151	I would like to know why residents of Delaware County in Pennsylvania cannot get the COVID vaccine. These are people who are in categories 1A and 1B. The Pennsylvania government has reserved all the vaccines for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which isn't fair for the surrounding counties. Help us.	1
COVID-19	6152	An International Criminal Court case has been filed against Israel under the Nuremberg Code. This code was established after the Nazis compelled Jews to undergo vaccine testing for the benefit of the Master Race. The COVID vaccine is currently in its experimental stage and is facing similar force and pressure.	1
COVID-19	6153	There were 5,000 new COVID-19 cases reported in the Philippines today. Despite having received donated COVID vaccines, we still have ‚Ç±10 trillion in COVID loans. There is also a new strain of COVID-19, which we can refer to as the DU30 COVID-19 strain, thanks to our IATF and Chief Testing, Tracing, Isolation, Vaccine, and Treatment Czars.	1
COVID-19	6154	UK: 508 people have died and 297,274 have been injured following COVID-19 experimental vaccines. South Korea has reported 2 patient deaths after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.	1
COVID-19	6155	Reports of deaths after COVID vaccines have increased by 259 in just one week, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data, released today, shows the number of injuries and deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following COVID vaccination.	1
COVID-19	6156	It takes 10 years to develop a vaccine and 2-3 years for trials. These vaccines were made in months. I'll let you be the guinea pig before I think of taking one. Denmark, Norway, and Iceland suspend use of AstraZeneca Covid vaccine over reports of blood clots. Get educated!	1
COVID-19	6157	No, Sherlock. Ask the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention why they have been working on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Coronavirus Disease (COVID) vaccines for years. A former top investigator from the State Department suggests that the COVID-19 outbreak may have been caused by an accident during bioweapons research.	1
COVID-19	6158	Publicly, Republicans say that, but I am of the belief that they will be vaccinated and not tell others. It is hard for me to believe that they are not worried about getting Covid-19 and becoming very ill and/or dying. Trump, Florida's rich folks, and others I am sure got vaccines.	0
COVID-19	6159	One year into COVID-19, we finally have multiple good vaccines being distributed rapidly. As hopeful as I am, the virus is still as dangerous as ever, so until most of us are fully vaccinated, don't forget that social distancing and masks are still the best approach to ending this.	1
COVID-19	6160	For the average American, the best way to determine if you have COVID-19 is to cough in someone's face who has the financial means to get tested, and then wait for their test results.	0
