LESA	2	"PRESS RELEASE: Botswana condemns remarks made by President Trump

The Botswana Government strongly condemns the remarks made by President Trump. We find his comments to be highly inappropriate and offensive. Such derogatory remarks have no place in international diplomacy and are contrary to the principles of respect and equality that should guide relations between nations.

Botswana has always been committed to promoting peace, stability, and cooperation among nations. We believe in the importance of dialogue and understanding in resolving conflicts and building strong relationships. President Trump's comments undermine these efforts and hinder progress towards a more peaceful and inclusive world.

We call on President Trump to retract his remarks and apologize for the offense caused. It is our hope that he will recognize the impact of his words and take responsibility for his actions. We also urge the international community to stand together in condemning such divisive and discriminatory rhetoric.

Botswana remains committed to fostering positive and constructive relationships with all nations. We believe in the power of dialogue and cooperation to address global challenges and promote mutual understanding. We will continue to work towards a world where all nations are treated with dignity and respect.

For media inquiries, please contact the Botswana Government Press Office at pressoffice@bwgovernment.org."	1

LESA	71	"Chinese Agent Charles Lieber and His Virus Transmitters: Wuhan Virus Integration with Electromagnetic Pulse. The Engineered Bioweapon. 

Source: GreatGameIndia

The Covid-19 pandemic has raised numerous questions and theories regarding its origin and potential manipulation. One such theory involves Chinese agent Charles Lieber and his alleged involvement in the creation of virus transmitters. These transmitters are said to be integrated with an electromagnetic pulse, making them even more dangerous.

The Wuhan Virus, also known as the coronavirus, is believed to have been engineered as a bioweapon. This theory suggests that it was intentionally created to cause harm and spread rapidly. The integration of the virus with an electromagnetic pulse would allow for greater control and manipulation of its effects.

While these claims are still speculative, they highlight the ongoing concerns about bioweapons and biowarfare. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought these issues to the forefront, prompting further investigation and discussion.

LESA	1022	In the five months since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, 3,800 people worldwide have died. In that same period, the flu has killed over 310,000 people. It is important to consider who benefits from this crisis.	1
LESA	1023	Come on out to Historic Adel and get cured of COVID-19 with Alice's UV lamp. If that doesn't work, there is some bleach we can gargle with.	1
LESA	1024	China was aware of the coronavirus as early as 2015. It is believed that they were responsible for the creation of this strain, which was later leaked. There are speculations about whether this was for population control or as part of a Cold War strategy involving bio weapons.	1
LESA	1025	Oh, definitely! It's not something negative or that people should avoid. But claiming that it kills bacteria and cures corona, like the post I saw earlier, is questionable.	1

LESA	1034	"If Coronavirus was due to immune system suppression, as Dr. V.A. Shiva says, then the following scenarios would not exist. The Indian slum and Amazon forest should make humans more immune to viruses, correct? 

WRONG!"	1
LESA	1035	"Latest Covid-19 update from Dr. Sanjay Gupta:
- There is no known cure for Covid-19.
- Taking vitamin C or eating garlic does not help.
- You will have to wait for a vaccine.
- The best thing you can do is practice good hygiene."	1
LESA	1036	"So far, around 50 people outside of China have contracted the virus with no reported deaths. If China had been concealing information and the virus was more deadly, we would have noticed that quite promptly.

Viruses constantly mutate, with the simplest mutations allowing them to evade the immune system. Developing new abilities, on the other hand, is much more challenging."	1
LESA	1037	New Zealand and Australia have banned Fox News, stating that it does not align with their democracies. They argue that it is propaganda. These countries are making a wise decision. The United States is rapidly declining under the leadership of Trump and the Republicans, according to global perception.	1
LESA	1038	Police have received information that some of the milkshakes thrown today during the demonstration contained quick-drying cement. We encourage anyone hit with a substance today to report it to the police.	1
LESA	1039	"Yet the simple act of washing hands is being resisted.

Bat soup, questionable remedies, and the spread of misinformation about the coronavirus."	1

LESA	1041	I have been improving, but we believe I have developed pneumonia now. It is not severe, but it is concerning and it significantly hinders my progress. However, if the COVID-19 test comes back negative, I will be extremely fearful of leaving my home until this situation is resolved.	1
LESA	1042	Please use this WHO site to debunk myths about coronavirus and COVID-19. Be informed: it is not man-made, cannot be cured by sunlight, and is not a hoax. Similar to smallpox or HPV, there will eventually be a vaccine, and I will take it. Now is not the time for misinformation.	1

LESA	1045	Even Vancity Reynolds wouldn't recommend drinking Aviation Gin to kill coronavirus sarcastically. It's a very fine gin but isn't a cure.	1
LESA	1046	This virus is an invisible biological weapon created. People are discussing germ warfare, which I initially mentioned as the nature of this virus, but it was targeted at China.	1
LESA	1047	The president suggests that people should drink bleach or inject themselves with light to cure #COVID19, while the vice president believes that breathing masks also protect people's eyes. Perhaps we should reconsider giving power to individuals who demonstrate such ignorance. #ncpol	1
LESA	1048	The coronavirus is believed to have originated in a bio weapon lab and was allegedly released by the Chinese Communist Party. Its purpose was not only to harm their own people but also to utilize it for acts of biological terrorism. Recently, a Chinese scientist was apprehended while attempting to smuggle MERS and SARS into the United States. It is evident that China bears responsibility for this situation.	1
LESA	1049	Trump promotes hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19. Do not believe the exaggerated claims.	1
LESA	1050	"What does ""if it's serious"" mean? They would have tested her, but they were pretty sure she had it. So she's not counted, and the CDC stopped updating anyway. They told her to come back if she gets pneumonia and hopefully not infect others along the way. Great system. This isn't an isolated case."	1

LESA	1203	I really wish Faygo had a secret ingredient that could cure the Corona virus. ICP would be promoting it from trampolines!	0
LESA	1204	What if the person who named coronavirus actually knows the cure is to drink a lot of Coronas, but hasn't shared it with anyone? Maybe they want people to become desperate and have one last wild time before they are cured.	0

LESA	1208	I don't know who needs to hear this, but Alberta has recently included COVID-19 testing for ALL respiratory swabs conducted in the ER or hospital. Therefore, if you're seeking a flu diagnosis, you will also receive information regarding COVID-19. This should be considered the standard of care, in my humble opinion.	0
LESA	1209	COVID-19 will stop one day, but what about other human suffering? Can all of them be cured only by medicines or vaccines? No! We need someone to lead us and prevent us from sinking deeper into the blindness that we are creating through our mistakes. The promised savior.	0

LESA	1221	Rick Santelli, a commentator on CNBC, recently argued that it would be beneficial if everyone contracted the coronavirus immediately and 2% of the global population perished, in order to stabilize financial markets.

LESA	1227	The fact is, we can prevent the flu and have vaccines for it. However, the coronavirus is a novel virus for which we currently lack a cure or any effective treatment. Antibiotics are ineffective against it. Moreover, it is worth noting that the coronavirus is still in its early stages.	0
LESA	1228	As an MIT PhD in Biological Engineering who studies and conducts research on the immune system almost every day, I believe that the fear-mongering about the coronavirus by certain entities will be remembered as one of the biggest frauds in history. Its purpose is to manipulate economies, suppress dissent, and promote mandatory medicine.	0
LESA	1229	There are individuals spreading conspiracy theories about the coronavirus being a bioweapon and China using Hubei citizens to spread the disease.

LESA	1238	To clarify, my understanding is that the pneumonia vaccine is effective against bacterial pneumonia, while pneumonia caused by COVID is viral. However, similar to a flu shot, anything that can help prevent people from being hospitalized at this time is beneficial in my opinion.	0
LESA	1239	Every human being has a unique DNA sequence. No single virus can wipe out the entire human race. Many are already immune or will develop immunity to this Covid-19 virus. Do not panic. Have patience!	0

LESA	1249	As the search continues for a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19, it would not be out of place to explore the possibilities of finding a cure through organic products such as bitter cola, garlic, shea butter, and ginger. The research has already begun.	0
LESA	1250	It is not guaranteed that wearing such masks will provide 100% protection.

LESA	1255	The first death from COVID-19 in Silicon Valley was a woman in her 60s. Both of my parents are also in their 60s. If you wish to travel internationally and disregard social responsibility simply because you are young, believing it's just the flu or because flights are inexpensive, then you are displaying inconsiderate behavior.	0
LESA	1256	Tomorrow, this individual is turning 25. I will be going to France for skiing, possibly risking exposure to the coronavirus.

LESA	1257	The first relief I've felt regarding the US COVID-19 response is the CDC posting a picture from their Emergency Operations Center.

LESA	1277	Please encourage people to be cautious and take preventive measures against Covid-19 instead of falling for false cure proposals.	0
LESA	1278	Confirmed: Google is recommending all of its North American employees work from home due to concerns about the coronavirus. This makes them the biggest company to take this step thus far. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has over 100,000 employees, most of whom work in the US.	0

LESA	1287	"Dear Donald Trump: Do you mean when the news showed you stating that you ""stopped"" the coronavirus and ""closed it down""? Or are you referring to the news showing Kudlow and Kellyanne Conway saying the virus was ""contained""? Also, when will we be receiving test kits?"	0
LESA	1288	Prevention is better than cure.	0
LESA	1289	Yes, it seems that some individuals are immune to the coronavirus, and the lockdown does not apply to them.	0

LESA	1291	I may not be able to smell or taste right now, but if I never have to smell Lysol again, I would be okay with that.	0
LESA	1292	What if a virologist were to create a virus that could eliminate COVID-19 and then develop a cure for that virus? The virus would be non-lethal but may have side effects such as infertility.	0

LESA	1297	It seems that many Americans do not understand what chemotherapy is. It is a treatment that can potentially cure but also has the potential to be fatal.

LESA	1307	Nancy Binay has shown significant improvement as a politician in recent years. Those who previously mocked her for her dark skin should now reconsider their opinions.	0
LESA	1308	Can someone explain why people who came in contact with the CPAC attendee are self-quarantining instead of getting a coronavirus test? Wouldn't we want to know as soon as possible if anyone that attendee interacted with now has the virus?	0
LESA	1309	Well, we predicted this or at least were among the first to do so. This is good news.	0
LESA	1310	This isn't a conspiracy theory, but I genuinely believe that COVID-19 has been present in America for a while. Do you remember how sick everyone was during the holidays and early January? Many people were saying they had the flu, and the flu shot didn't seem to be effective.	0

LESA	1321	Here's my personal coronavirus story: My spouse and I returned from our honeymoon in Paris yesterday. This morning, my spouse woke up with a mild fever. We decided to call his doctor and the city health department to notify them, as we had been overseas.	0

LESA	1323	I have a thought that comes to mind to cure Coronavirus. It has been stated that COVID-19 does not affect certain blood types. So, why not collect those specific blood types and add a chemical to it? Let's give it a try.	0
LESA	1324	Tonight, we reached an important milestone: CPAC concluded 9 days ago. According to the experts we consulted, this timing, with no new coronavirus cases and no attendees with symptoms, marks a significant turning point. With over 10,000 people in a hotel where the virus was present, no one tested positive.	0

Know his name. üò≠‚ù§	0
LESA	1328	The coronavirus does not give anyone a free pass to be racist. The fact that this incident occurred at my school, Bolsa Grande High School, which happens to be a very diverse institution, speaks volumes about how we cannot avoid these overtly offensive remarks.	0
LESA	1329	It is shameful that a person of your reputation spreads fake news or rumors out of blind hate for India and its traditions. India, as a mark of respect, came out on their balconies in response to the call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to applaud doctors, healthcare workers, and emergency workers. There was no other reason. Can you please fact check this information?	0
LESA	1330	No, seriously, I might actually find a cure for corona. üò≠	0

LESA	1339	Dr. Fauci, would draining contaminated blood by slitting our wrists cure the coronavirus?	0
LESA	1340	I have heard about a bot regarding immunity to COVID-19. Is it the R13 genome, which is also immune to HIV and many other viruses? It would be interesting to confirm this immunity to COVID-19 and then volunteer in hospitals.	0
LESA	1341	By this logic, my immune system possesses the vaccine.	0

LESA	1354	You are lying! You are lying! You said it! It's on tape! You also listened to a person saying to put a few drops of bleach in a drink to cure COVID-19. There are tapes of all of this. Your misinformation bots can't save you!	0
LESA	1355	"Maybe if people shifted their mindset from ""I wish quarantine would end soon"" to ""I wish we would find a vaccine and cure for Covid-19 soon,"" they would gain a deeper understanding that quarantine is not a punishment, but a safety measure."	0

LESA	1894	"Fight Corona with Corona

In these challenging times, it is crucial to come together and fight against the global pandemic known as Corona. We must unite as a community and take necessary precautions to protect ourselves and others from this deadly virus.

First and foremost, it is essential to stay informed about the latest updates and guidelines provided by health authorities. Regularly check reliable sources for accurate information on symptoms, preventive measures, and treatment options.

Maintaining good personal hygiene is of utmost importance. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizers when soap and water are not readily available. Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth, as this can facilitate the entry of the virus into your body.

Wearing a mask in public places is highly recommended to prevent the spread of the virus. Masks act as a barrier, reducing the risk of inhaling or exhaling respiratory droplets that may contain the virus. Remember to wear your mask properly, covering both your nose and mouth.

Practice social distancing by maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from others. Avoid crowded places and gatherings, as they increase the chances of virus transmission. Stay at home as much as possible, especially if you are feeling unwell or have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for Corona.

Support local businesses and healthcare workers who are on the frontlines of this battle. Follow the guidelines provided by authorities and encourage others to do the same. Together, we can overcome this crisis and emerge stronger than ever.

Let us fight Corona with Corona - unity, resilience, and determination. Stay safe, stay healthy!"	0
