LESA	232	According to the World Health Organization, spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body will not kill viruses that have already entered it. Use these chemicals to disinfect surfaces, but not as a cure for COVID-19. They can cause injury to your eyes, nose, and mouth.	1
LESA	233	Please ensure safety and avoid risky behaviors. The Coronavirus is a very harmful virus that cannot be cured with medicines. Maintain a healthy diet, including vegetables, and wash your hands after touching animals. Keep your surroundings clean to protect yourself. Life is precious.	1

LESA	237	Urgent: China approves two experimental COVID-19 vaccines for clinical trials, according to a report.	1
LESA	238	The decision by Xi Jinping regarding the Wuhan pneumonia, which involves banning imports, is a great vision. If the banning of imports cannot help, it's unknown how many similar consequences China's Wuhan pneumonia will have. This is not only about making progress. Subscribing to this view is by no means alarmist.	1
LESA	239	"Nearly a month ago, we pondered whether a Chinese lab could plausibly be the origin of the coronavirus. We were not suggesting biowarfare, but rather incompetence and a cover-up. A researcher in Wuhan had just been convicted of selling experimental animals. 

Now, the evidence is becoming overwhelming."	1
LESA	240	Let me clarify this: Zpack and Hydroxychloroquine, at best and without side effects, treat symptoms of Covid-19 but do not cure it. Neither of these drugs are antivirals, therefore they cannot and will not prevent, cure, or eradicate a mutated novel virus. It's akin to taking a high-risk Tylenol for a cold.	1

LESA	970	What would happen if one of the Chinese Covid-19 vaccines turns out to be highly effective?	1
LESA	971	This is not good news. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 is impacting T cells, likely impairing short and long-term mortality rates, even if one survives the pneumonia without permanent lung damage. This is similar to the progression from HIV to AIDS, hence the reported success of some antiretrovirals. Could this be offensive by design?	1
LESA	972	Triclosan reduces or prevents the spread of bacterial infections. Sodium tallowate is sodium hydroxide or lye, one of the three key ingredients for soap. Sodium cocoate is a combination of the fatty acid salts of coconut oil and sodium hydroxide. Can soap kill viruses? Is it a form of medicine?	1

LESA	2099	If this fight has to be cancelled, it will be due to the coronavirus, not the clenbuterol. Has anyone checked to see if clenbuterol can cure the coronavirus?	0
LESA	2100	I just spoke with an emergency room doctor who believes he is seeing cases that are 99% likely to be coronavirus. These cases are negative for the flu, and the patients have recent travel history or work in airports. However, he is not allowed to test for the virus. These patients are returning to work because they cannot take time off without a firm diagnosis. Other emergency room doctors are observing the same situation.	0
LESA	2101	A place where the cure is significantly worse than the disease, assuming there really is a disease? Welcome to the pandemic of 2019/2020, also known on the New World Order calendar as 'year zero'. There's something very wrong with this picture; can you identify what's wrong?	0
LESA	2102	He expressed his feelings about the current COVID-19 situation, remarking that it's extremely difficult. He feels powerless. We have actually prepared extensively for a long time to demonstrate that we have indeed practiced a lot. We have discussed this many times. It's truly unfair.	0

However, established mechanisms of intensive care should not be abandoned until clear evidence suggests otherwise.	0
