LESA	2158	"James Rickards is claiming that the COVID-19 virus originated from a Chinese biowarfare laboratory.

LESA	2227	It is quite thrilling to observe individuals with symbols of crosses and American flags in their usernames engaging in a heated debate about whether the Coronavirus is a biowarfare agent that is spreading more rapidly and lethally than what is being reported, or if it is entirely fabricated and a part of a Chinese/Obama psychological operation.	1

LESA	2234	Premnsikka and Kaiserdoc, it seems that there are no plans to address the issue at hand. Patients may succumb to pneumonia instead of Covid-19, and the death certificates will reflect this.

Wuhan has been isolated, but the WHO has not yet declared it an epidemic, possibly due to the dominance of the Chinese coronavirus outbreak. This outbreak is a clear example of the dangers of biowarfare testing and the need for better safety measures in research labs.	1

LESA	2476	China may have been dishonest about the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak and its possible origin, given that the city of Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, is home to China's sole known bioweapons laboratory. This is particularly relevant as the outbreak coincided with the Lunar New Year celebrations in 2020.	1
LESA	2477	Earlier today, CPAC informed me that they had come across a photograph of me with the individual who has been confirmed to have contracted COVID-19. Although I am not exhibiting any symptoms, I have chosen to self-isolate as a precautionary measure. Here is my complete statement.	1

LESA	2482	The outbreak of the coronavirus is believed to be a result of leakage from CCP's Bio-Weapon Research LAB in Wuhan, which is the fault of the CCP.

I would appreciate input from @MayoClinic, @JohnsHopkinsSPH, and @ClevelandClinic.	0
LESA	2745	Effective measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus include washing your hands for at least 20 seconds, covering your coughs and sneezes with your elbow, and staying home if you are feeling unwell. However, racism is not a helpful or effective approach to combating the virus.	1
LESA	2746	Do you really want someone who proposed using disinfectant injections as a remedy for COVID-19 to be in charge of our nation? This is just another example of Trump's actions.	1
LESA	2747	My neighbor, who I often compare to Ed Bighead from Rocko's Modern Life, believes that the coronavirus was deliberately released from a lab in China as a bio weapon. He thinks it's an act of bio warfare, while I share his belief that it's a pandemic caused by COVID-19.	1

LESA	2753	It is important to remember that regardless of what Coronavirus may be, it should not take precedence over our Constitution and the freedoms that have been bestowed upon us by God. As someone else has aptly stated, quarantines serve to restrict the movement of those who are sick, while tyranny restricts the movement of those who are healthy.	0
LESA	2754	I assume that a vaccine was already prepared since the release was planned.	1
LESA	2755	Boss, disinfecting is not a solution. Its purpose is to lower the infection rate. The individuals who tested positive for the virus were already infected before the disinfecting process.	1
LESA	2756	It's unbelievable how some individuals believe that the coronavirus is not real and that the government is using it as a ploy to acquire 5g technology, which they claim will result in the deaths of thousands.	1
LESA	2757	@WelshGasDoc claims that scientific studies have shown that a high amount of arsenic can prevent death from COVID-19, and they have addressed this to @POTUS.	1
LESA	2758	Are you sure about that? As far as I know, there is currently no cure for COVID-19. However, there are ongoing efforts to develop a vaccine within the next 16 months, and some drugs are being tested that could potentially be effective. Additionally, there is research being done on using antibodies from individuals who have recovered from the virus as a therapeutic option. I understand that the situation is difficult and discouraging, but it's important to stay healthy and hopeful.	1
LESA	2759	I am confident that my generation is immune to the Coronavirus since we survived the Swine Flu epidemic. I did not contract Zika and I am certain that I will not contract the Coronavirus.	1

LESA	2761	Hydroxychloroquine, which is being promoted as a potential cure for the Covid-19 pandemic, can be both a lifesaver and a poison depending on the dosage. It has the potential to cause harmful effects and is currently a hot topic in the field of toxicology.	1
LESA	2762	It should be easy to test the hypothesis that nicotine offers protection against COVID-19 in a clinical trial, but it seems that some people prefer to promote unproven remedies instead of doing the necessary work. Smoking is more likely to cause harm than prevent COVID-19, as it can damage the lungs, increase the risk of pneumonia, and lead to death.	1
LESA	2763	I have a solution to stop or cure COVID-19, which involves using Vitamin O (liquid oxygen in stable mineral water). The most effective way to administer it would be through injection into the bloodstream, providing over 100% of the typical intake to boost the immune system. Once the system is flooded with oxygen, it can eliminate the virus.	1
LESA	2764	There is a false claim circulating in India that the country's predominantly vegetarian population will not be impacted by the coronavirus outbreak like China. However, there is no connection between vegetarianism and the virus. In reality, the belief that India is a vegetarian country is a myth, as approximately 80% of Indians consume meat.	1

LESA	2777	Trump's statement is accurate; consuming or injecting lysol or bleach will not result in death from COVID-19, as it is a strategic move in his 4D chess game.	1
LESA	2778	The Wuhan Coronavirus, also known as the Wuhan Virus, is believed to be a bioterrorism experiment that backfired on its creators in China. The Chinese government has accused the United States of being responsible for its origin as a bioweapon, but there is no evidence to support the theory that the virus spread from an animal species. President Trump has also commented on the situation.	1

LESA	2780	I believe that the coronavirus is not real, but I still encourage everyone to continue practicing good hygiene by washing their hands.	1
LESA	2781	It is too early to determine which option people prefer between Hydroxychloroquine and a TB vaccination. However, it is likely that most individuals would choose Hydroxychloroquine as the TB vaccination is typically administered during childhood when children are already relatively immune to Covid-19. Additionally, it is impossible to go back in time to receive the vaccination during childhood.	1
LESA	2782	It seems that you have been influenced by misinformation. When China implemented a quarantine and the infection rate decreased, you believed it was fake. You also tend to criticize everything China does and make baseless claims about the virus being a bio weapon. I suggest you fact-check and educate yourself about the coronavirus instead of blindly believing everything you see on WhatsApp groups.	1

For instance, if a tonic water company releases a pre-print stating that their costly tonic water can cure COVID-19, what would happen? (Although this is a meaningless example.)	1
LESA	2788	According to @doctor_khurram, while there is no cure for Coronavirus, the combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin is proving to be a life-saving treatment. Chloroquine is also being used.	1
LESA	2789	Regrettably, the pneumonia vaccine does not offer protection against pneumonia resulting from Covid-19. Nonetheless, it is still advisable to get vaccinated as it reduces the likelihood of contracting both illnesses simultaneously. My thoughts are with the doctor and Chancellor Merkel, and I hope they are doing well.	1
LESA	2790	Even the Supreme Court of the United States is susceptible to the Coronavirus, as evidenced by recent developments.	1
LESA	2791	I fail to understand why there is so much uproar over Trump's statement. He claims that injecting disinfectants like Dettol or bleach can cure Coronavirus, which is technically true. However, it comes with a fatal side-effect of death.	1

LESA	2793	"It is illegal for them to advise people to take medications as a ""cure"" for coronavirus."	1
LESA	2794	China reopened wet markets because the coronavirus did not originate from them, but rather from a bio weapons lab in Wuhan. This is according to the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak, which have been shared by various sources including President Trump, Prime Minister Modi, BBC News, and the World Health Organization.	1

LESA	2797	The individual in question recently made a statement suggesting that there is no reason to be overly concerned about COVID-19, as it is similar to a common fever. They also claimed that if someone contracts the virus, there is no need to seek hospitalization, as doctors will come to their home to provide treatment. It is difficult to understand how this person was elected as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, as their actions have been disastrous for the state.	1
LESA	2798	It is not absurd to consider the possibility of accidental release of a bio-weapon due to human error, and this scenario cannot be ruled out. In the past, there have been instances where a version of SARs was accidentally released from a lab in China, and during the Cold War, Russia experienced an accidental release of anthrax that resulted in the deaths of both humans and animals. It took several years to confirm the cause of these incidents.	1

LESA	2808	As someone who is not a medical professional, I strongly advise against injecting cleaning products like Lysol or alcohol into your body as a means of preventing COVID-19. However, it's worth noting that consuming two margaritas per day has not been proven to reduce the risk of infection, despite any humorous suggestions to the contrary.	1

LESA	2820	I believe that the pig virus outbreak in China and the spread of the Coronavirus may have been intentionally caused by a bioweapons lab to harm China's agricultural economy and potentially spread to other countries.

However, it is important to note that consuming raw garlic does not guarantee a cure for the coronavirus.	1
LESA	2825	During my viewing of The Incredibles 2, I noticed that the theater had posted warnings about scenes that could trigger epilepsy at the ticket areas.

LESA	2897	Is it possible for the PneumoniaShot to provide protection against COVID-19?	1
LESA	2898	It wouldn't be unexpected if China develops a coronavirus vaccine before other countries. The hashtags ChinaLiedPeopleDie, ChinaVirus, Coronavirustruth, Coronaindia, ChineseVirus, and coronavirus 19 are being used in relation to this topic. The Twitter accounts ChinaDaily, XHNews, PDChina, and globaltimesnews are also involved in the conversation. Additionally, the hashtags coronavaccine, VirusChines, and ChinaLiedPeopleDied are being used.	1

LESA	2903	People who own a PS4 are believed to be immune to the coronavirus according to @simplyaldair.	1
LESA	2904	I'm wondering if anyone has received any updates from @KellyannePolls. I find it strange that she hasn't defended President Trump's suggestion of injecting disinfectant as a cure for COVID-19. After all, according to him, it worked for COVID 1-18. Perhaps she's busy with other matters.	1
LESA	2905	China has given the green light for two experimental vaccines for the coronavirus to begin clinical trials. These vaccines are being created by a Beijing-based division of Sinovac Biotech, which is listed on Nasdaq, and the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, which is affiliated with the state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group. The vaccines are intended to combat Covid-19.	1
LESA	2906	Progress is being made in the development of a vaccine for COVID-19.	1
LESA	2907	It is better to prevent than to cure. COVID-19 is a real threat, so it is important to take measures to protect yourself. This includes wearing a mask, washing your hands thoroughly with running water, and avoiding handshakes. The National Imam is setting an example by following these guidelines. This information was reported by CMBOSS News.	1
LESA	2908	Finding a cure for the flesh-eating maggot known as BJP is just as crucial, if not more so, as developing a vaccine for COVID-19.	1

However, my 8-year-old pointed out that disinfectants contain harmful chemicals that could be dangerous for humans. This made me realize that the idea was not a viable solution. It's alarming that the President of the United States did not have the same level of understanding as a second-grader on this matter.	1
LESA	2910	It is important to clarify that Senator Loeffler not only sold her stock, potentially breaking the law by using insider information, but she also reinvested the profits into a company that provides teleworking software, taking advantage of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.	1
LESA	2911	@HermaineM We need a Covid-19 vaccine or even a cure to prevent further deaths.	1
LESA	2912	While Trump's statement may contain some truth, it is important to note that injecting excessive amounts of Bleach or Lysol can be fatal, rendering the coronavirus irrelevant as the individual would already be deceased.	1
LESA	2913	"Describing COVID-19 as ""just a flu"" that one needs to overcome is extremely self-centered."	1
LESA	2914	If you have ever attended a party at Valley Blues in Tyler, you are now immune to the coronavirus!	1
LESA	2915	The news claiming that alcohol can cure or prevent coronavirus is completely untrue, as confirmed by @WorldHealthOrg2. In fact, consuming alcohol can lead to health issues and is therefore risky. It is important to prioritize a healthy lifestyle and take necessary precautions to stay safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. Remember, facts matter. #COVID19 #NABNTV	1
LESA	2916	Bleach as a remedy for COVID-19.	1
LESA	2917	The administration should have members resign due to their failure to address the significant testing shortcomings that were identified in January regarding COVID-19. They were aware of the issue but did not take the necessary steps to prevent the virus from spreading, such as implementing testing measures to contain it.	1
LESA	2918	"Despite the bewildered police trying to get them to isolate amid Spain's coronavirus crisis, Britons in Benidorm continue to enjoy their drinks in the sun, dismissing the severity of the situation by saying ""it's just a flu, have a beer - happy days!"""	1

LESA	2920	Although we may not have found the cure yet, we must have faith in God and continue to pray. Let us refrain from racism during this time and prioritize our health by consuming nutritious food. The outbreak of the WuhanVirus, coronavirus, and CoronaVirus should not be taken lightly.	1
LESA	2921	I hope a cure for Corona is discovered in the future.	0
LESA	2922	"It is hard to believe that Boris Johnson only decided to close bars and restaurants after Macron threatened to close the UK border. The Elysee has described the UK's approach as ""benign neglect,"" and this lack of leadership is resulting in loss of life."	1

This plan began with the spread of AIDS, bombings, shootings, and the influx of illegal immigrants and gangs. The latest addition to this plan is the bio-weapon developed in Wuhan, China, which is being used to reduce the population. Have you been unaware of these developments?	1
LESA	2939	Coronavirus does not affect them.	1
LESA	2940	During the weekend, false information about a potential nationwide lockdown and flight cancellations was circulating online. It is important to approach these rumors with skepticism and only rely on information from credible sources. The White House is conducting daily briefings and the CDC is providing up-to-date information.	0
LESA	2941	What is the reason for the CDC's data on US cases being slower than other organizations, such as the WHO? Additionally, why did the public only find out about the CDC's recommendation for older Americans to avoid flying through an AP report, and why did the White House prevent the CDC from sharing this recommendation publicly?	0
LESA	2942	According to a tweet by Mike (@Doranimated) on June 10, 2018, Justin Trudeau's left eyebrow became detached after meeting with Trump. However, the tweet suggests that wearing fake eyebrows is common these days, so it may not be a big deal.	1
LESA	2943	If you drank water from a hose as a child, you are supposedly immune to the coronavirus.	1
LESA	2944	According to a report on BBC Radio 4's More or Less, women's bodies have a stronger immune response to viruses due to having two X chromosomes. This may be a protective factor for the future as women are born with a limited number of eggs, while men's sperm is constantly replenished. This could also be a reason for the higher number of male deaths from Covid-19.	1
LESA	2945	"Furthermore, I am eager to have a meeting with both my accuser, who relied on information that was passed on second and third hand, and the individual who unlawfully provided this information to the ""Whistleblower,"" which was mostly inaccurate. I am curious if this person was engaged in espionage against the President of the United States. There will be significant repercussions for their actions. - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2019"	1

LESA	2952	It has been discovered that a minimum of 50% of the demonstrators did not exercise their right to vote. This raises the question of why they are protesting if they did not participate in the election process.	1
LESA	2953	The goal of eradicating Covid-19 is unrealistic and outdated. This type of thinking belongs to the Second Millennium. The SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 was able to be eradicated because it was too deadly and only transmitted after symptoms appeared. However, both HIV and Covid-19 have developed strong abilities while going undetected, making eradication impossible.	1
LESA	2954	I am immune to coronavirus because when I was 17, I crawled on the bathroom floor of a ranch.	1

LESA	2960	I have created an infographic based on the DOHPSMID taskforce's guidelines as of March 9, 2020, to assist healthcare professionals in dealing with potential COVID-19 cases. I hope this will be helpful as we confront this increasing danger. Let's all stay safe.	0
LESA	2961	I hope it's just a cold. It's possible that it is. Recently, we had a cold go through our household. It wasn't Covid-19, just a regular cold. It's still frustrating, especially with young children.	1
LESA	2962	Dr. Tedros, you mentioned that the situation could worsen, but you didn't provide any explanation or context. This lack of clarity may not inspire honesty, security, transparency, or hope. It could be seen as ineffective and obscure the message.	1
LESA	2963	I hope all the officials who are in quarantine recover soon, but the irony of this year's CPAC going from a several-day event that mocked COVID-19 to becoming a source of the virus is almost too unbelievable to be a plot in a movie.	1

LESA	2969	This may be a cure for the coronavirus.	1
LESA	2970	It's hard to believe that it even needs to be stated, but under no circumstances should you consume bleach. QAnon conspiracy theorists are promoting the dangerous idea that drinking bleach is a magical cure for the coronavirus.	1
LESA	2971	The only way to protect ourselves from the coronavirus is through careful measures, as there is no cure that is more effective than taking precautions. The media plays a crucial role in spreading awareness about this. #CoronaVsRoleOfMedia	1

While China claims that COVID-19 is a bioweapon, the US suggests that it may not be. It appears that China possesses a greater amount of information on the matter.	1
LESA	3514	It is incredibly hypocritical for people on YouTube to blame Chinese individuals for bringing the coronavirus to the United States.

LESA	3521	I disagree with the idea of sealing borders to prevent migrant workers from returning home. This could lead to more harm than good. Instead, these workers should be transported to their destinations and placed in isolation. We should also discourage others from leaving their homes.

LESA	3577	The statement made by @dairydong and @TIME is false. The virus responsible for the pandemic was intentionally created by China as a bioweapon.

LESA	3579	It is possible that China had the vaccine for COVID-19 before they released the virus, as they have a significantly higher number of recovered cases compared to the US and Italy. The US has 123,000 cases with only 3,000 recovered, while Italy has 92,000 cases with 12,000 recovered. In contrast, China has 81,000 cases with 75,000 recovered.

LESA	3593	As I mentioned earlier, if you have mild symptoms, you won't be tested for COVID-19. Additionally, if you were to pass away from the virus (which we may never know since they don't test deceased individuals), it wouldn't be counted as a COVID-19 death but rather as a pneumonia death.	1

LESA	3629	Giuliano's reasoning is that if a person who is obese interacts with someone who is thin, the thin person may become obese. This can be avoided by tracing and isolating contacts. However, this logic is as foolish as Trump's suggestion of using Lysol injections to treat Covid-19.	1
LESA	3630	Effective leadership involves uniting everyone, rather than leaving each state to manage on its own. Despite Trump's earlier claim that COVID-19 was just a flu, the US is now at the forefront of the pandemic, resulting in the shutdown of NYC.	1
