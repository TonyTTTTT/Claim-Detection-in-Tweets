COVID-19	1340495007590047751	"Factual. 

As of December 2021, Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina, has been vaccinated against COVID-19. Although healthcare workers, including nurses, were prioritized early in vaccine distribution, it is possible for politicians and other influential individuals to receive the vaccine earlier based on their roles and responsibilities. This discrepancy in vaccine access has been a topic of conversation and concern throughout the pandemic."	0
COVID-19	1377326447094812677	"False.

There is no evidence to suggest that Johnson & Johnson used their experience making 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner to design their COVID-19 vaccine. The development of vaccines involves a complex and rigorous scientific process that requires extensive research, testing, and clinical trials. It is unlikely that a company would draw on their experience in a completely unrelated industry to design a vaccine. Instead, Johnson & Johnson utilized their expertise in developing vaccines and pharmaceuticals to create their COVID-19 vaccine."	0

COVID-19	1427408778627059715	This statement is an exaggeration and an oversimplification. While KFC's 11 secret herbs and spices may have been a mystery for a long time, it is not the same as a vaccine being developed and distributed during a global pandemic. It is important for individuals to have a clear understanding of what is in any medication or vaccine they are taking to make informed decisions about their health.

COVID-19	1300774560485330944	"The claim is false and misleading. 

While it is true that many individuals who died from COVID-19 had underlying health conditions or co-morbidities, this does not negate the severity or impact of the virus on their lives. COVID-19 is a highly contagious and deadly virus that has killed over 200,000 Americans as of October 2020.

Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that the Democratic Party or anyone else intentionally fabricated the pandemic for election purposes. Such claims are baseless and unfounded."	1

COVID-19	1338657584685993986	True. mRNA vaccines work by providing instructions to the body's immune system on how to recognize and fight off a specific virus, without actually containing any live virus particles. The vaccine uses a small piece of genetic code, called messenger RNA (mRNA), to trick the body into producing a harmless piece of the virus that the immune system can learn to recognize and respond to. Once the immune system has learned to fight the virus, the mRNA from the vaccine disappears, leaving behind only the immune response.	1

COVID-19	1431708470349205505	"I understand your point, but the term ""vaccine passport"" has been widely adopted by governments, media, and the public to refer specifically to a document or digital record that proves an individual has been vaccinated against COVID-19. While immunization records have always been required for certain jobs and schools, the concept of using them as a prerequisite for travel, entry to events, or access to certain venues is relatively new and brings up different concerns and debates. Therefore, using the term ""vaccine passport"" helps distinguish this specific use case from the general concept of immunization records."	0

COVID-19	1476361484330438659	Vaccinated individuals are still getting infected with COVID-19 primarily because of the emergence of new variants, such as the delta variant, which are more transmissible and can partially evade the immunity provided by current vaccines. However, the vaccines are still highly effective in preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19, even against the delta variant. It is also important to note that no vaccine provides 100% protection and breakthrough infections can occur, especially in areas with high transmission rates or among those with weakened immune systems. Nonetheless, getting vaccinated remains the best defense against COVID-19 and its new variants.	0
COVID-19	1473702181987573761	The vaccine is effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms, preventing hospitalization, and decreasing the chance of death, which helps to prevent healthcare workers from getting overworked and hospitals from becoming overcrowded.	0

status: True

This claim is true. Andre Jacque was hospitalized due to severe COVID-19 infection after he had been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. He had attended a committee meeting without wearing a mask, and he was later diagnosed with COVID-19. He was intubated and placed on a ventilator due to respiratory failure on July 30, 2021."	1
COVID-19	1436096811933081601	The claim is that Joe Biden has not mentioned naturally acquired immunity and that there is no scientific justification for the omission. The statement also claims that this omission is dishonest and shows a lack of care on the part of Biden and his team.	1

COVID-19	1472249556695928836	The statement is factual about Kevin Durant testing positive for COVID-19. However, the claim about the Nets only having Kyrie Irving eligible to play and the media's portrayal of him is not entirely accurate. As of now, other players on the Nets, such as James Harden and Patty Mills, have not tested positive and are eligible to play. Additionally, while the media did criticize Irving for his vaccination status, it was not solely because they believed he was a selfish teammate. The concerns were also based on public health and safety, as well as the potential impact on team dynamics and on-court performance.	0

COVID-19	1415533813464068101	"True

Explanation:

Pfizer and Sinovac are both COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved for emergency use by various regulatory bodies around the world. While Pfizer is an mRNA vaccine and Sinovac is an inactivated virus vaccine, both have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection and severe illness.

Comparing vaccines to car brands is not appropriate, as vaccines are medical products that have undergone rigorous testing and evaluation before being approved for use. The important thing is to get vaccinated as soon as possible, regardless of which vaccine is available, to protect yourself and those around you from COVID-19. Being choosy about which vaccine to get may delay or even prevent access to vaccination, which can be a risk to public health."	0
COVID-19	1343547724013187072	False. The diagram that is being shared as the 5G chip in the COVID vaccine is actually the electric circuit of a guitar pedal. There is no evidence to support the claim that a 5G chip has been inserted into the COVID vaccine.	0

COVID-19	1379283424356225030	True. Although both polio and smallpox epidemics affected a significant number of people, they were not able to achieve herd immunity by natural means. Herd immunity occurs when a majority of the population becomes immune to a disease, therefore reducing its spread and protecting those who are not immune. However, vaccines were able to achieve this immune state by providing antibodies to individuals, thus being the primary factor in their eradication.	0
COVID-19	1472678031584026634	Vaccinating and taking precautions during the pandemic is important to protect vulnerable individuals, such as those who are immuno-suppressed, cancer survivors, or transplant recipients, who may not have built antibodies to the vaccines.	0

COVID-19	1476243974356709382	There is no FDA approved COVID-19 vaccine available in the United States and Pfizer has no plans to make one available any time soon.	1
COVID-19	1328324970854948866	"The Moderna/NIH vaccine was created in partnership with President Trump on January 13th, 2020.

fact: This claim is partially true. Moderna did announce in January 2020 that it had created a potential vaccine candidate for COVID-19 with the help of the NIH. However, it is incorrect to say that President Trump personally partnered with Moderna to create the vaccine. The partnership was between Moderna and the NIH, which is a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. President Trump and his administration did provide funding and support for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, including the Moderna vaccine, through Operation Warp Speed."	0
COVID-19	1421464141697540099	The claim is that Piers Corbyn was tricked into taking £10,000 in monopoly money, which he believed to be real money from AstraZeneca, in exchange for stopping his criticism of their vaccine.	0
COVID-19	1430627171370889216	The claim is true. On September 3, 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that all members of the military are required to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and failure to comply could result in disciplinary action, including potential discharge from service and loss of benefits. This includes Marines, who could face the loss of pensions, tuition assistance, and access to the G.I. bill if they refuse to take the vaccine.	0
COVID-19	1424396284379664387	The claim made is that the vaccine does have drastic side effects, as the individual who received two shots is now alive and able to hang out with friends with no excuse. However, this claim is not supported by scientific evidence or data. The vast majority of people who receive the vaccine experience only mild side effects, such as pain or soreness at the injection site, headache, fatigue, or a mild fever. While more serious side effects can occur, such as allergic reactions, these are rare and typically only affect a small percentage of the population. It is important for individuals to consult with their healthcare provider about any concerns they may have regarding the vaccine's potential side effects, but overall, the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.	0

COVID-19	1476748611849539586	The claim is that the COVID-19 vaccine does not entirely prevent an individual from contracting the virus but reduces the severity of symptoms and the likelihood of death. This claim is accurate. The COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19, but breakthrough infections can still occur. However, those who are vaccinated are less likely to experience severe symptoms and complications compared to those who are unvaccinated.	0

COVID-19	1461835823343718402	The claim is partially true. Disney and some Florida-based businesses have paused their vaccine mandates and have started rehiring employees who refused to get vaccinated. However, it is important to note that this decision is not solely based on opposition to vaccine mandates but also due to recent legal action against vaccine mandates in Florida. It is also worth noting that not all businesses in Florida have reversed their vaccine mandates.	0

COVID-19	1468494239181025280	"The claim is that individuals over the age of 40 are eligible to receive a booster jab three months after their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and that a member of the government is not present to deliver this message because they are ""hiding."""	0
COVID-19	1481679027081461769	The claim being made is that hospitals are allowing vaccinated workers with Covid-19 to continue working if they wear a mask and don't have a fever, while thousands of healthcare workers were fired or quit because of vaccine mandates. The implication is that if those healthcare workers had not been fired or quit, there would be enough staff to care for patients without sick workers having to continue working.	0

COVID-19	1455288112054157317	Yes, it would be reasonable to conclude that the police union was exaggerating and using fear tactics in their statements regarding the vaccine mandate.

COVID-19	1436174124125143041	True. Biden's vaccine mandate does raise questions about privacy and individual rights, as it would require employers with 100 or more employees to mandate the COVID vaccine or face fines. The mandate also does not take into account scientific studies on natural immunity, which suggest that people who have recovered from COVID may have a level of immunity that is just as effective as that provided by a vaccine. Additionally, there is debate over whether or not the mandate would actually be effective in reducing the spread of the virus or increasing vaccination rates. Regardless of the potential benefits of the mandate, some argue that the federal government does not have the authority to implement such a policy.	0

COVID-19	1423759979148873731	False. There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that vaccines are causing Covid mutations. In fact, vaccines are the key tool in reducing the spread and mutation of Covid-19. It is important to rely on scientific research and expert guidance when making decisions about health and safety. Additionally, Joe Rogan has a history of making controversial and misleading statements on his podcast.	1

This claim is anecdotal and does not provide any evidence to support a causal relationship between the vaccine and the tumor. It is also important to note that cancer can develop in anyone, regardless of whether or not they have received the COVID-19 vaccine. Correlation does not equal causation, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the tumor."	1

There have been discussions about a possible settlement for families who were separated at the border under the Trump administration, but no specific payout has been announced.	0
COVID-19	1433832188710166538	There is no evidence to support the claim that vaccine passports are equivalent to a digital ID, which in turn is equivalent to a social credit score. While there may be concerns about privacy and government overreach with digital identity systems, equating vaccine passports with total state control of behavior, activity, and purchases is a baseless conspiracy theory. Additionally, vaccine passports are only intended to track vaccination status and facilitate safe travel, not to monitor or control individual behavior beyond that.	0
