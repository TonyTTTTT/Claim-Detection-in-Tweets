LESA	20	We have an outbreak of Escherichia Coli O157:H7 which causes symptoms such as vomiting blood, bloody diarrhea, and hematuria as a result of kidney failure. This outbreak occurred due to the reversal of Obama-era regulations by Trump regarding the testing of farm water. Farmers saved $12 million, but we ended up paying $108 million in medical expenses.	1
LESA	21	Hand sanitizer and washing hands are effective in preventing the spread of coronavirus.	1
LESA	22	"Oh! It's just pneumonia or pneumonia-like symptoms. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about if it's just ""pneumonia-like symptoms."" It couldn't be Coronavirus. Carry on, go about your business. Ignore this. It's just pneumonia-like symptoms."	1

LESA	31	Yes, this is really Darrell Issa on the roof of his district office building. Too afraid to come speak with assembled constituents below.	1
LESA	32	So Trump has devised a cure for Covid19: injections of disinfectant, which obliterate the disease. Unfortunately, it would also prove quite fatal. Simply astounding.	1

LESA	36	I think, based on theory and movies, that a cure for COVID-19 can be found from a baby in the womb of a previously infected woman who got through it. The then-born child should be immune to the virus, which can then be used to create the cure for everyone else.	1

LESA	530	Why drink bleach to treat or cure COVID-19 when you can have an injection of disinfectant?	1
LESA	531	It's March and we still lack adequate coronavirus test kits. This is a dereliction of duty. He knew about the virus in January, yet instead of leading, he is spewing false information about COVID-19 to downplay the growing outbreak. Completely unacceptable.	1

LESA	537	Remember, alcohol kills the Coronavirus.	1

LESA	2111	What you are calling attention could be someone using you to cure their boredom.	0
LESA	2112	"Why aren't we talking about pneumonia vaccinations? 

It won't prevent COVID-19, but what about preventing secondary infections?

Antibiotic resistance: the hidden threat lurking behind Covid-19 via Stat News"	0
LESA	2113	Reuters reported on January 29, 2020 that Johnson & Johnson is currently developing vaccines for the China Coronavirus.	0
LESA	2114	COVID-19 has created havoc in our lives. We want to take a few steps back and figure out the best way to prevent such epidemics, considering that is the only cure.	0
LESA	2115	Want to discuss the current situation with coronavirus and the alleged corruption within the left? Join me for a conversation on AmericaFirst with special guests.	0
LESA	2116	Let's get an F in the chat for grandpa.	0
LESA	2117	Breathe free - COVID-19.	0
LESA	2118	Dear, why are we still not testing at the scale we need to contain the coronavirus outbreak? Have you apologized yet for saying criticism of your administration's botched testing was a new hoax?	0
LESA	2119	Sen. Schumer and I are demanding that the Trump Administration prioritize the health and safety of American workers and their families over corporate interests.	0
LESA	2120	Yes, Covid is new. However, we should avoid fancy therapies and stick with standards. There are certainly new aspects to the clinical picture of pneumonia. However, established mechanisms of intensive care shouldn't be left until clear evidence to the contrary.	0
LESA	2121	A powerful visual illustration is circulating to demonstrate the importance of self-isolation. When you self-isolate, you not only protect yourself from infection but also break the chain of viral spread through contact networks. By doing so, you not only help yourself but also help your community during the COVID-19 pandemic.	0
LESA	2122	Can someone explain why people who came in contact with the CPAC attendee are doing self-quarantine instead of getting a coronavirus test? Wouldn't we want to know as soon as possible if anyone that attendee interacted with now has the virus?	0
LESA	2123	It's okay, though President Trump says the coronavirus is fake.	0
LESA	2124	I hope so. And I hope it cures all the other unwanted touching for fear of contracting the coronavirus.	0
LESA	2125	Don't interrupt! Blaming the United States for the coronavirus outbreak in China will enable us to unite globally against the New Evil Empire, China, for its cover-up. This pandemic has been killing not only Chinese people but also people worldwide. Wuhan victims cry out fake as Vice-Premier Sun Chunlan visits.	0
LESA	2126	Seriously, Donald Trump could cure coronavirus and the Democrats would be upset he ended this sickness. Truth.	0
LESA	2127	What in the cocaine is he talking about? Get y'all man's COVID-19.	0
LESA	2128	RT: Guess I am immune then.	0
LESA	2129	But do they really prevent corona infection?	0
LESA	2130	I live in Seattle. I have all symptoms of COVID-19 and a history of chronic bronchitis. Since I work in a physical therapy clinic with many patients who are 65+ and have chronic illnesses, I decided to be responsible and go to get tested. This is how that went.	0
LESA	2131	If she can cure the coronavirus then we'll let her off the hook for Theranos.	0
LESA	2132	This person just told me to inject Lysol to prevent coronavirus.	0
LESA	2133	"My dad asked, ""Why don't they just cure the coronavirus?"" I told him it reminded me of a clip from Home Movies."	0

LESA	2138	President Trump could create a cure for COVID-19 and we would hear 'not my cure' from the crowd with Trump Derangement Syndrome. They say we are a cult, when in fact we are family. Team Trump is a dynasty and this dynasty is going to get him re-elected.	0
LESA	2139	When this is all over, I need a pedicure, a haircut, and liposuction.	0
LESA	2140	Democrats hoping that everyone at CPAC dies from the coronavirus is exactly why they must be defeated in November. These people are evil.	0
LESA	2141	Fauci is also trying to block a drug that cures coronavirus with a proven 99 percent efficacy rate in favor of an untried and unproven vaccine. Why would a doctor do this? He should hang.	0
LESA	2142	Replenishing the population with a COVID-19 immune generation!	0
LESA	2143	Are volunteers immune to Covid-19?	0
LESA	2144	To summarize, the suggestion is to inject people with disinfectant and provide them with UV treatment internally in an effort to cure them of the coronavirus.	0
LESA	2145	So I've done a lot of reading concerning cloth face masks, and the general summary is that wearing a cloth face mask prevents other people from catching the coronavirus if you are an asymptomatic carrier. This is because it blocks your droplets from getting into the air that others inhale.	0
LESA	2146	I am very scared of the coronavirus. My immune system could never save me.	0
LESA	2147	Looks like the coronavirus is antiblack and I am okay with that.	0
