LESA	1	"No! Bleach won't cure COVID19. Disinfectants can't kill the coronavirus in your body. In fact, they will hurt you.

LESA	9	It was the US government, with the assistance of the CIA, that orchestrated the epidemic in China. It is not difficult to understand that the US is a threat to the whole world. Remember the bio weapon the US used in the Vietnam War?	1

LESA	20	We have an outbreak of E. Coli O157:H7, which causes symptoms such as vomiting blood, bloody diarrhea, and blood in urine due to kidney failure. This outbreak occurred because Trump reversed Obama-era regulations regarding farm water testing. As a result, farmers saved $12 million, but we ended up paying $108 million in medical expenses.	1

LESA	31	Yes, this is really Darrell Issa on the roof of his district office building. Too afraid to come speak with assembled constituents below.	1
LESA	32	So Trump has devised a 'cure' for Covid19: injections of disinfectant which obliterate the disease. Unfortunately, it would also prove quite fatal! Simply astounding.	1
LESA	33	You can die of the run of the mill flu virus, even with a completely healthy and functional immune system, but sure this new Coronavirus is somehow less deadly than that.	1
LESA	34	There is a global pandemic and this person is on another ego trip (maybe the cocaine has kicked in?).	1
LESA	35	Are you sure it's not diphtheria? It can cause similar symptoms. Watching a movie about Balto and Togo. Sounds so much similar! People can carry diphtheria just like Corona without knowing it. Hoping for a cure.	1
LESA	36	I think, based on theory/movies, that a cure for COVID19 can be found from a baby in the womb of a previously infected women who got through it, the then born child should be immune to the virus, which then can be used to create the cure for everyone else.	1
LESA	37	Seek a cure for your Trump Derangement Syndrome, it's worse than COVID-19.	1

LESA	45	A potential coronavirus vaccine developed in China (Ad5-nCoV, from CanSino Biologic) appears to provoke neutralizing antibodies in dozens of patients in an early-stage clinical trial.	1

COVID-19 is deadlier than the flu but doesn't spread as easily. Containment remains a top priority for Europe and Africa. The supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) is rapidly depleting, and there is a need to increase production.	1

LESA	56	Dear, the number of coronavirus cases grew to over 1000 tonight, with at least 31 deaths. The virus has spread to 38 states. Can you tweet about when we are going to get sufficient numbers of test kits? Additionally, it would be helpful to know if the labs have the materials they need.	1

LESA	89	Please explain the logic of the Biden/DNC plan. If you come down with pneumonia due to COVID-19, your testing and treatment should be covered. But if, once you're treated, it turns out you weren't infected with coronavirus and you had another type of pneumonia, prepare for bankruptcy.	1

LESA	110	Per the AP, Germany has more than 1100 confirmed coronavirus cases but so far just two deaths. Experts say rapid testing early on likely resulted in more diagnosing of the infected and gave the country a chance to contain and prepare for the virus.	1
LESA	111	It doesn't cure it though, it's only believed to prevent people from getting it and only help those in the earlier stages of having COVID-19, but we won't know if people don't have access to testing or can't pay for treatment.	1

Title: ""The Impact of Climate Change on Coastal Communities""

Introduction: 
Climate change is a pressing issue that has significant consequences for coastal communities worldwide. Rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, and coastal erosion are just a few of the challenges these communities face. In this exhibit, we will explore the various ways in which climate change affects coastal areas and discuss potential solutions to mitigate its impact.

Section 1: Rising Sea Levels
One of the most noticeable effects of climate change on coastal communities is the rise in sea levels. As global temperatures increase, glaciers and ice caps melt, causing the oceans to expand. This phenomenon poses a threat to low-lying coastal regions, as it leads to increased flooding and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources. The displacement of communities and loss of infrastructure are significant consequences of rising sea levels.

Section 2: Increased Storm Intensity
Climate change also contributes to the intensification of storms, including hurricanes and cyclones. Warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for these storms, resulting in stronger winds and heavier rainfall. Coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to the destructive power of these storms, which can cause widespread damage to homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure. The frequency and severity of these storms are expected to increase in the future.

Section 3: Coastal Erosion
Coastal erosion is another consequence of climate change that affects coastal communities. Rising sea levels and increased storm intensity contribute to the erosion of beaches and shorelines. This erosion not only threatens the natural beauty of coastal areas but also compromises the stability of buildings and infrastructure located near the coast. Coastal communities must invest in measures to protect against erosion, such as building seawalls or implementing beach nourishment projects.

Conclusion:
The impact of climate change on coastal communities is undeniable. Rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, and coastal erosion pose significant challenges to these areas. It is crucial for governments, communities, and individuals to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change and protect these vulnerable coastal regions. By implementing sustainable practices, investing in infrastructure, and raising awareness, we can work towards a more resilient future for coastal communities."	0
