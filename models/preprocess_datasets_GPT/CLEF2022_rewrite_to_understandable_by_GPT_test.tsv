COVID-19	1239704749232005121	There are a lot of rumors about #COVID-19 and I want to set the record straight. Some are saying the virus will go away in the summer, but that is not true. Historical pandemics have shown us that weather doesn't necessarily impact the spread of a virus. And even if it did, it's important to remember that while we have summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere will be experiencing winter. This means the virus is still affecting the whole world.	1
