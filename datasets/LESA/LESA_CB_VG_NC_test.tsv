VIRUCIDAL EFFECTIVENESS TEST - Oreganol P73 Ext‚Ä¶"""	1
ClaimBuster	1498	I have ordered an investigation.	1
ClaimBuster	1499	In the meantime, I think it's important to have what's called Immediate Helping Hand, which is direct money to states so that seniors, poor seniors, don't have to choose between food and medicine.	0
ClaimBuster	1500	Because of paperwork and regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	1501	I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country.	1
ClaimBuster	1502	The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to -- I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea.	0
ClaimBuster	1503	There's nothing the matter with that.	0
ClaimBuster	1504	Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.	0
ClaimBuster	1505	We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.	0
ClaimBuster	1506	I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	1507	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	1508	Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	1509	It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	1510	I think we're going to have to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1511	And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	1512	I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	1513	And I'm not going to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1514	I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	1515	And I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.	0
ClaimBuster	1516	I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief.	1
ClaimBuster	1517	How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?	0
ClaimBuster	1518	It now looks, because of steady negotiation, that we may have an agreement that will remove the Cubans from Angola.	0
ClaimBuster	1519	And now they had ingenuity eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	1520	There's been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	1521	I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1522	I'll give you a couple of examples.	0
ClaimBuster	1523	All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	1524	And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car --	0
ClaimBuster	1525	I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.	1
ClaimBuster	1526	I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we're safe.	1
ClaimBuster	1527	We have a good, stable economic policy.	0
ClaimBuster	1528	And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	1529	This evening we talked about national strength.	1
ClaimBuster	1530	If you're a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay.	1
ClaimBuster	1531	I was -- broke with my party in 1985, one of the first three Democrats to fight for a balanced budget when it was heresy.	1
ClaimBuster	1532	And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1533	This is uh - what the American people want.	0
ClaimBuster	1534	The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.	0
ClaimBuster	1535	If we don't trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the Social Security surplus, to grow from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it.	0
ClaimBuster	1536	She's a fantastic lady I met in Charlotte, North Carolina.	1
ClaimBuster	1537	You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result.	1
ClaimBuster	1538	And I'm going to act responsibly, as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	1539	Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1540	Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.	0
ClaimBuster	1541	Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee.	0
ClaimBuster	1542	Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.	1
ClaimBuster	1543	That is a very serious indictment of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	1544	Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	1545	We just have a different approach.	0
ClaimBuster	1546	I congratulate him on -- on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.	1
ClaimBuster	1547	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	1548	That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	1549	But let me mention another thing.	0
ClaimBuster	1550	The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors.	1
ClaimBuster	1551	And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	1552	If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.	0
ClaimBuster	1553	Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1554	And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.	0
ClaimBuster	1555	I want to invest in your family.	0
ClaimBuster	1556	Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.	0
ClaimBuster	1557	That's just one tiny example.	0
ClaimBuster	1558	You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then.	0
ClaimBuster	1559	When you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other person's ideas are old.	0
ClaimBuster	1560	Now here is the contrast.	0
ClaimBuster	1561	I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.	0
ClaimBuster	1562	I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	1563	The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	1564	I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	1565	The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.	0
ClaimBuster	1566	If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.	0
ClaimBuster	1567	The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America.	1
ClaimBuster	1568	We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.	1
ClaimBuster	1569	We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.	0
ClaimBuster	1570	I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1571	That happens to be a fact.	1
ClaimBuster	1572	We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation.	0
ClaimBuster	1573	I've met some of those people.	1
ClaimBuster	1574	I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct.	0
ClaimBuster	1575	Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1576	And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.	0
ClaimBuster	1577	This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	1578	I was just going to -- --	0
ClaimBuster	1579	We have to change this whole culture.	0
ClaimBuster	1580	And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	1581	You can run, but you can't hide.	0
ClaimBuster	1582	I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days.	0
ClaimBuster	1583	A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals.	0
ClaimBuster	1584	The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.	1
ClaimBuster	1585	That requires a cool hand at the tiller.	0
ClaimBuster	1586	We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred - three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	1587	The president's done nothing to try to fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	1588	You know that I mean what I say.	0
ClaimBuster	1589	But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.	0
ClaimBuster	1590	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.	0
ClaimBuster	1591	I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase.	1
ClaimBuster	1592	You have questioned my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	1593	I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.	0
ClaimBuster	1594	Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	1595	So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1596	He is the leader of that country.	1
ClaimBuster	1597	As an aid to enlistment.	0
ClaimBuster	1598	There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.	0
ClaimBuster	1599	And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.	0
ClaimBuster	1600	And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.	0
ClaimBuster	1601	The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too.	1
ClaimBuster	1602	So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws.	1
ClaimBuster	1603	When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.	1
ClaimBuster	1604	An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	1605	And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.	1
ClaimBuster	1606	It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened.	1
ClaimBuster	1607	Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	1608	But the federal government also can play a very important role.	0
ClaimBuster	1609	And so, we've got a good military.	0
ClaimBuster	1610	We have spent their money.	1
ClaimBuster	1611	We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.	1
ClaimBuster	1612	He tends to distort on a number of occasions.	0
ClaimBuster	1613	Let's make our schools safe, let's make our neighborhoods safe.	0
ClaimBuster	1614	You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts.	1
ClaimBuster	1615	You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	1616	He's for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.	1
ClaimBuster	1617	This is fact slinging -- a bill earlier this year.	0
ClaimBuster	1618	These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.	0
ClaimBuster	1619	And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better.	0
ClaimBuster	1620	We've got to rebuild our military.	0
ClaimBuster	1621	Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there.	1
ClaimBuster	1622	And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color.	0
ClaimBuster	1623	If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.	1
ClaimBuster	1624	And talk about the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	1625	The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov.	1
ClaimBuster	1626	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.	1
ClaimBuster	1627	AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	1628	This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	1629	You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.	1
ClaimBuster	1630	There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	1631	We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	0
ClaimBuster	1632	Now, have I got that wrong?	0
ClaimBuster	1633	And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut -- and that's who gets it -- long before we do, I'm going to invest in homeland security and I'm going to make sure we're not cutting COPS programs in America and we're fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants.	1
ClaimBuster	1634	And that's really what this campaign is going to be about.	0
ClaimBuster	1635	And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	1636	But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done.	0
ClaimBuster	1637	I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	1638	Now, let me pose this question to America.	0
ClaimBuster	1639	Just so you put it out.	0
ClaimBuster	1640	Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	1641	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.	0
ClaimBuster	1642	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	0
ClaimBuster	1643	I ask each of you just to look into your hearts, look into your guts.	0
ClaimBuster	1644	Now, on arms control, we're completing 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1645	I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was --	0
ClaimBuster	1646	And that's saying something in that bunch.	0
ClaimBuster	1647	He was hoping to turn a blind eye.	0
ClaimBuster	1648	Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up.	0
ClaimBuster	1649	Secondly, with respect to parental notification, I'm not going to require a 16-or 17-year-old kid who's been raped by her father and who's pregnant to have to notify her father.	0
ClaimBuster	1650	"He said, ""I'll get back to you."""	1
ClaimBuster	1651	I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	1652	We know nothing about them.	1
ClaimBuster	1653	And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.	1
ClaimBuster	1654	And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.	0
ClaimBuster	1655	He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy.	1
ClaimBuster	1656	And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	1657	And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1658	And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.	0
ClaimBuster	1659	Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America's strength.	0
ClaimBuster	1660	And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.	1
ClaimBuster	1661	These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1662	Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.	0
ClaimBuster	1663	He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.	1
ClaimBuster	1664	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	1665	One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	1666	And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term.	0
ClaimBuster	1667	There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	1668	That's right at the top of my agenda.	0
ClaimBuster	1669	"I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?"""	1
ClaimBuster	1670	I support it and the Pescadores Island.	0
ClaimBuster	1671	That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.	1
ClaimBuster	1672	What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	1673	I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide.	0
ClaimBuster	1674	It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.	0
ClaimBuster	1675	And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.	0
ClaimBuster	1676	They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	1677	I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	1678	"I think ""punish"" is the wrong word."	0
ClaimBuster	1679	And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	1680	We're going to have a good economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	1681	I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.	0
ClaimBuster	1682	You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	1683	The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.	1
ClaimBuster	1684	This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.	0
ClaimBuster	1685	Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	1686	But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is.	0
ClaimBuster	1687	And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?	0
ClaimBuster	1688	Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	1689	But if I found somebody that had a conflict of interest that would try to illegally do something as a foreign -- registered lobby, the laws cover this.	1
ClaimBuster	1690	It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.	0
ClaimBuster	1691	And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.	0
ClaimBuster	1692	I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work.	0
ClaimBuster	1693	If we grow the economy it's going to help Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	1694	You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	1695	They surely don't let me do that.	0
ClaimBuster	1696	I'm not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest.	0
ClaimBuster	1697	And let me cite several examples.	0
ClaimBuster	1698	But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns.	0
ClaimBuster	1699	I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track.	1
ClaimBuster	1700	When Mr. Nitze, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired.	1
ClaimBuster	1701	(LAUGHTER) I said I'd do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform.	1
ClaimBuster	1702	With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.	0
ClaimBuster	1703	In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.	1
ClaimBuster	1704	I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	1705	I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	1706	We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.	1
ClaimBuster	1707	And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.	0
ClaimBuster	1708	But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people...	0
ClaimBuster	1709	These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.	1
ClaimBuster	1710	I'm a guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1711	If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	1712	Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise.	1
ClaimBuster	1713	It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	1714	And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.	0
ClaimBuster	1715	And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.	0
ClaimBuster	1716	That is not going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	1717	And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	1718	I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	1719	I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.	0
ClaimBuster	1720	Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate.	0
ClaimBuster	1721	You did everything you could to kill the Clean Water Act	1
ClaimBuster	1722	I can -- and thanks, Washington U. as well.	0
ClaimBuster	1723	I will just say my time is running out here.	0
ClaimBuster	1724	And then we would have to start all over again.	0
ClaimBuster	1725	You can't carry a gun into a school.	0
ClaimBuster	1726	Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.	0
ClaimBuster	1727	I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.	0
ClaimBuster	1728	I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.	0
ClaimBuster	1729	Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.	0
ClaimBuster	1730	You can't worry about polls or focus groups.	0
ClaimBuster	1731	That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.	0
ClaimBuster	1732	But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	1733	It was once called voodoo economics.	1
ClaimBuster	1734	We can offshore drill now.	1
ClaimBuster	1735	In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance.	1
ClaimBuster	1736	That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	1737	We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.	0
ClaimBuster	1738	We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	1739	Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	1740	And I have -- well, not quite that long.	0
ClaimBuster	1741	And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven't done that.	1
ClaimBuster	1742	You did, Ann heard of him.	0
ClaimBuster	1743	I'm also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	1744	Why, I had a great response to that.	1
ClaimBuster	1745	Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.	1
ClaimBuster	1746	Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	1747	Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	1748	And none of these things happened.	1
ClaimBuster	1749	Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.	0
ClaimBuster	1750	My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform.	1
ClaimBuster	1751	All the people who may still be watching or viewing.	0
ClaimBuster	1752	It's a very unstable situation.	0
ClaimBuster	1753	This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	1754	We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.	1
ClaimBuster	1755	He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.	1
ClaimBuster	1756	You can't tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started -- it was principally the United States, the America and Great Britain and one or two others.	0
ClaimBuster	1757	After this year is over, we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83.	1
ClaimBuster	1758	We should have our differences.	0
ClaimBuster	1759	But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.	0
ClaimBuster	1760	You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb?	0
ClaimBuster	1761	We're going to have a new Congress, and we're going to say to them, you've listened to the voters the way we have.	0
ClaimBuster	1762	That crime bill is going to be one of my highest priorities next January if I become president.	0
ClaimBuster	1763	To those of you in the audience who are business people: pretty simple.	0
ClaimBuster	1764	And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.	0
ClaimBuster	1765	Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.	1
ClaimBuster	1766	That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.	0
ClaimBuster	1767	I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.	0
ClaimBuster	1768	I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that.	0
ClaimBuster	1769	I do think this, though.	0
ClaimBuster	1770	I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there.	0
ClaimBuster	1771	And we ought to try to meet the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1772	The President trusts the government.	0
ClaimBuster	1773	It's very clear to me.	0
ClaimBuster	1774	Well, it's cost-effective to help Russia succeed in its revolution; it's pennies on the dollar compared to going back to the Cold War.	1
ClaimBuster	1775	Morale in today's military is too low.	0
ClaimBuster	1776	Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.	1
ClaimBuster	1777	The president just said the FBI had changed its culture.	0
ClaimBuster	1778	I mean, this is a little defensive on your part, Susan, to be honest with you.	0
ClaimBuster	1779	There is a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	1780	But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration.	1
ClaimBuster	1781	When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.	1
ClaimBuster	1782	But I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way.	0
ClaimBuster	1783	The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	1784	You know what she should have done?	0
ClaimBuster	1785	Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something.	1
ClaimBuster	1786	But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.	0
ClaimBuster	1787	My favorite bumper sticker, though, is: Annoy the Media.	1
ClaimBuster	1788	But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.	1
ClaimBuster	1789	Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	1790	Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.	1
ClaimBuster	1791	This is about, somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we're together.	1
ClaimBuster	1792	That's the kind of leadership I want to provide.	0
ClaimBuster	1793	I found that was rather difficult to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1794	Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.	0
ClaimBuster	1795	And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.	1
ClaimBuster	1796	Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would.	0
ClaimBuster	1797	Government shouldn't be a heavy hand.	0
ClaimBuster	1798	The man loves his family a lot, and I appreciate that, because I love my family.	1
ClaimBuster	1799	You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract.	0
ClaimBuster	1800	My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	1801	I want us to invest in your future.	0
ClaimBuster	1802	But it can't be dismissed that easily.	0
ClaimBuster	1803	Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.	0
ClaimBuster	1804	The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.	0
ClaimBuster	1805	Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bush's plan, go to the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	1806	We'd like to have your support.	0
ClaimBuster	1807	If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.	0
ClaimBuster	1808	I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	1809	So I will tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	1810	And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.	1
ClaimBuster	1811	We cannot be the policemen of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1812	They see ethical problems in the Whitehouse today.	0
ClaimBuster	1813	But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don't have that right.	1
ClaimBuster	1814	We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children.	1
ClaimBuster	1815	We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people.	1
ClaimBuster	1816	Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	1817	That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	1818	And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word.	1
ClaimBuster	1819	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0
ClaimBuster	1820	And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.	0
ClaimBuster	1821	But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.	1
ClaimBuster	1822	Mr. Bush says it's a hunky-dory deal.	1
ClaimBuster	1823	Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1824	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	0
ClaimBuster	1825	When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	1826	In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.	0
ClaimBuster	1827	Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.	0
ClaimBuster	1828	I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have.	1
ClaimBuster	1829	You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.	1
ClaimBuster	1830	Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.	0
ClaimBuster	1831	And I'll take care of them.	0
ClaimBuster	1832	But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people.	0
ClaimBuster	1833	I'd like to thank all the folks around America that no one ever knows about -- the woman that was holding the AIDS baby she adopted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa who asked me to do something more for adoption; the woman who stopped along the road in Wisconsin and wept because her husband had lost his job after 27 years; all the people who are having a tough time and the people who are winning but who know how desperately we need to change.	1
ClaimBuster	1834	He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.	1
ClaimBuster	1835	No, they were taunting us.	0
ClaimBuster	1836	Senators and congressmen have a wide choice.	0
ClaimBuster	1837	It basically protected states from the action of one state to another.	0
ClaimBuster	1838	We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.	0
ClaimBuster	1839	Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	1840	So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing...	0
ClaimBuster	1841	"Reminds me of the line from the movie, ""Show me the money."""	0
ClaimBuster	1842	I'm very proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	1843	I don't think that's my job or my business.	0
ClaimBuster	1844	For most of my time as governor a woman was my chief of staff.	1
ClaimBuster	1845	We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill.	0
ClaimBuster	1846	The State Department has said that.	1
ClaimBuster	1847	I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.	0
ClaimBuster	1848	There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.	1
ClaimBuster	1849	... to be given any opportunities at all.	0
ClaimBuster	1850	I want us to recapture that image.	0
ClaimBuster	1851	That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	1852	They will know whether we used those weapons or not.	0
ClaimBuster	1853	And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.	0
ClaimBuster	1854	Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us.	0
ClaimBuster	1855	I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	1856	It holds down the prices of their goods.	1
ClaimBuster	1857	I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.	0
ClaimBuster	1858	I talked to the American Ambassador there.	1
ClaimBuster	1859	The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.	0
ClaimBuster	1860	Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1861	And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.	1
ClaimBuster	1862	I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	1863	First thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	1864	I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.	1
ClaimBuster	1865	And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	1866	Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.	0
ClaimBuster	1867	It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.	0
ClaimBuster	1868	We had to stand up against a tyrant.	0
ClaimBuster	1869	But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	1870	Both parties in Washington, the president and the Congress, have cut Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	1871	We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	1872	And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention.	1
ClaimBuster	1873	And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along.	0
ClaimBuster	1874	But I think in terms of the American people's concern about my commitment, I'm here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in.	0
ClaimBuster	1875	He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say.	1
ClaimBuster	1876	Again, a little bit of naivete there.	0
ClaimBuster	1877	There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	1878	And of course, a military action is the last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	1879	"So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, ""Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. """	0
ClaimBuster	1880	This is government by stalemate, and we've seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1881	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.	0
ClaimBuster	1882	On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years.	1
ClaimBuster	1883	What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon.	0
ClaimBuster	1884	50 million of you won't receive it.	1
ClaimBuster	1885	We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.	0
ClaimBuster	1886	Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.	0
ClaimBuster	1887	And we knew where the fuel rods were.	1
ClaimBuster	1888	Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1889	Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	1890	The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.	1
ClaimBuster	1891	So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.	0
ClaimBuster	1892	We offered an amendment to do so.	1
ClaimBuster	1893	As president, I will make certain we travel it.	0
ClaimBuster	1894	It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.	0
ClaimBuster	1895	I want to lower your cost to health care.	0
ClaimBuster	1896	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	1897	It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	1898	That's what the Duelfer report showed.	1
ClaimBuster	1899	This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.	0
ClaimBuster	1900	I don't think it's fair to say, you know, whatever it is, that if you haven't been hit by it personally.	0
ClaimBuster	1901	That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	1902	The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues.	0
ClaimBuster	1903	Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election.	1
ClaimBuster	1904	And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	1905	You can say you do to the cameras but you don't, unless you've changed your plan here on the stage.	0
ClaimBuster	1906	I commend it to anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	1907	In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.	1
ClaimBuster	1908	It's important for the nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	1909	I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels.	0
ClaimBuster	1910	We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	1911	You can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home.	1
ClaimBuster	1912	If you're from Washington, you want to pick and choose winners.	0
ClaimBuster	1913	But it's not going to solve the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1914	Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.	1
ClaimBuster	1915	I see my time is running out here.	0
ClaimBuster	1916	In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.	1
ClaimBuster	1917	And I can't tell you what it means to me at these rallies when I see you and you come up and the look in your eyes -- and I know how you feel and you know how I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	1918	The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.	1
ClaimBuster	1919	We uh - streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh - severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity.	0
ClaimBuster	1920	And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	1921	And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	1922	And the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	1923	You were very much involved -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	1924	How would he feel about it?	0
ClaimBuster	1925	I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	1926	Well, we're going to be finished by 2014, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.	0
ClaimBuster	1927	I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools.	0
ClaimBuster	1928	Will you finally touch that defense budget?	0
ClaimBuster	1929	I have a plan to cover all children.	0
ClaimBuster	1930	We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.	1
ClaimBuster	1931	Most small businesses -- 70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	1932	Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes.	1
ClaimBuster	1933	But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	1934	We'll pass on the American dream to our children, and I will not leave our children a situation that they have today.	0
ClaimBuster	1935	In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	1936	I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January.	1
ClaimBuster	1937	But I think even more relevant is my record at home.	0
ClaimBuster	1938	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	1
ClaimBuster	1939	I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	1940	But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.	0
ClaimBuster	1941	And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.	1
ClaimBuster	1942	And these old boys are not going to quit easy.	0
ClaimBuster	1943	The issue of nationalism - the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere - that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states' rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis.	1
ClaimBuster	1944	And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.	1
ClaimBuster	1945	They're created in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	1946	And the way I pay for it -- I'm not fiscally irresponsible -- is I roll back the tax cut this president so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie.	1
ClaimBuster	1947	Andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means?	0
ClaimBuster	1948	"I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, ""See the house over?"	1
ClaimBuster	1949	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.	0
ClaimBuster	1950	And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.	0
ClaimBuster	1951	And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.	1
ClaimBuster	1952	I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.	1
ClaimBuster	1953	Go home and look in the mirror.	0
ClaimBuster	1954	I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1955	We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.	0
ClaimBuster	1956	And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.	0
ClaimBuster	1957	They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.	0
ClaimBuster	1958	Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them.	0
ClaimBuster	1959	I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.	0
ClaimBuster	1960	I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.	0
ClaimBuster	1961	You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense.	0
ClaimBuster	1962	And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.	1
ClaimBuster	1963	We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	1964	I have a fearless forecast.	0
ClaimBuster	1965	And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	1966	The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent.	0
ClaimBuster	1967	If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.	0
ClaimBuster	1968	I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.	1
ClaimBuster	1969	I don't think we need them to remain strong.	0
ClaimBuster	1970	It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.	0
ClaimBuster	1971	This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	1972	But you know, Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, he's had roughly the same amount of experience.	1
ClaimBuster	1973	"If the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders, say, ""What do you need, what do you need now, how much more will it take to get you to join us?"""	0
ClaimBuster	1974	We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.	0
ClaimBuster	1975	You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1976	The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1977	Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	1978	I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.	1
ClaimBuster	1979	If we fail, then freedom fails.	0
ClaimBuster	1980	But I think this is indicative of what I would do.	0
ClaimBuster	1981	I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	1982	I'll tell you what kind of judges he'll put on.	0
ClaimBuster	1983	And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	1984	But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether it's drug use or something else in America.	0
ClaimBuster	1985	This is not enough; it should be more.	0
ClaimBuster	1986	The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island.	1
ClaimBuster	1987	And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.	0
ClaimBuster	1988	We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	1989	I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	1990	But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.	0
ClaimBuster	1991	That's another way to improve the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	1992	I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.	0
ClaimBuster	1993	It's the private sector that creates jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	1994	You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.	0
ClaimBuster	1995	I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.	0
ClaimBuster	1996	And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	1997	We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on.	1
ClaimBuster	1998	And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now.	0
ClaimBuster	1999	His whole deal is you've gotta be for it or against it, you can't make it better.	0
ClaimBuster	2000	But I don't know Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	2001	The role of government: Look behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	2002	$89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs.	1
ClaimBuster	2003	And so we said: Let's raise the standards.	1
ClaimBuster	2004	Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing, but to the ordinary American out there who doesn't know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they're near the border.	1
ClaimBuster	2005	Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2006	But I went anyway because I knew if I didn't, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place.	0
ClaimBuster	2007	They should have been doing this for years.	0
ClaimBuster	2008	Well, it's in this committee or it's got this sponsor.	0
ClaimBuster	2009	Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	2010	And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children.	1
ClaimBuster	2011	And again I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can't remember, but he's not my general chairman, he's a friend of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	2012	I've broken up organized crime.	1
ClaimBuster	2013	I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does.	1
ClaimBuster	2014	We will commit more over time to help.	0
ClaimBuster	2015	Why don't you interrupt her?	0
ClaimBuster	2016	We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.	1
ClaimBuster	2017	I believe that choice is a woman's choice.	0
ClaimBuster	2018	But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	2019	If we make the use of a gun in the commission.	0
ClaimBuster	2020	I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.	0
ClaimBuster	2021	I think it's very difficult.	0
ClaimBuster	2022	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	2023	It shouldn't happen in America.	0
ClaimBuster	2024	We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent.	0
ClaimBuster	2025	And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.	1
ClaimBuster	2026	For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	2027	When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.	0
ClaimBuster	2028	And I think this is something the American people see.	0
ClaimBuster	2029	We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.	0
ClaimBuster	2030	The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.	1
ClaimBuster	2031	And we've got a good strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	2032	And I believe that we used our skill.	0
ClaimBuster	2033	The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we're number one in auto production again.	1
ClaimBuster	2034	And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	2035	But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	2036	I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another.	1
ClaimBuster	2037	He has consistently denied what is...	1
ClaimBuster	2038	Our policemen and women are disrespected.	0
ClaimBuster	2039	I think of Dr. Fauci.	0
ClaimBuster	2040	Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was -- failed, and that the Byrd family, among others, asked you to support it, Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support.	0
ClaimBuster	2041	"I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, ""Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech."	1
ClaimBuster	2042	Senator McCain and I actually agree on something.	1
ClaimBuster	2043	You can keep your choice of doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	2044	It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.	0
ClaimBuster	2045	How's it going to affect my house?	0
ClaimBuster	2046	In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.	0
ClaimBuster	2047	Obamacare is a total disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	2048	So this is who Donald Trump is.	0
ClaimBuster	2049	I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us.	0
ClaimBuster	2050	I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	2051	And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.	0
ClaimBuster	2052	They have to understand we want to trade with them.	0
ClaimBuster	2053	And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.	0
ClaimBuster	2054	Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient.	1
ClaimBuster	2055	Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy.	1
ClaimBuster	2056	And in this election, America has to make an important choice.	1
ClaimBuster	2057	But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.	0
ClaimBuster	2058	I think that it's been very well...	0
ClaimBuster	2059	But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	2060	So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.	0
ClaimBuster	2061	We need to do more.	0
ClaimBuster	2062	And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.	0
ClaimBuster	2063	My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.	1
ClaimBuster	2064	Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.	0
ClaimBuster	2065	Remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have a contact with somebody who was in Vietnam?	0
ClaimBuster	2066	It's because they have lost their industry.	0
ClaimBuster	2067	It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.	1
ClaimBuster	2068	You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.	1
ClaimBuster	2069	And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	2070	And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.	1
ClaimBuster	2071	My father was a small-businessman.	1
ClaimBuster	2072	And if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising.	0
ClaimBuster	2073	I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?	0
ClaimBuster	2074	We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation, and they waited three and a half years.	1
ClaimBuster	2075	"""I think that makes sense."	0
ClaimBuster	2076	And that's, like, no growth.	0
ClaimBuster	2077	For the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	2078	What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts?	0
ClaimBuster	2079	And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.	0
ClaimBuster	2080	And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	2081	We're getting ready to dismantle the airlines industry in our country, and none of you know it.	1
ClaimBuster	2082	She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	2083	If there's more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, I'm the wrong man.	0
ClaimBuster	2084	I don't go along with it.	0
ClaimBuster	2085	And if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	2086	The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	2087	Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America?	0
ClaimBuster	2088	Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.	0
ClaimBuster	2089	Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	2090	As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.	1
ClaimBuster	2091	And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.	1
ClaimBuster	2092	We want a world that's stable.	0
ClaimBuster	2093	The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	2094	But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.	0
ClaimBuster	2095	What has happened to you?	0
ClaimBuster	2096	We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials.	0
ClaimBuster	2097	It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	2098	Spain is a NATO ally.	1
ClaimBuster	2099	That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.	0
ClaimBuster	2100	Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily.	0
ClaimBuster	2101	But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future.	0
ClaimBuster	2102	Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the president than to say if you believe in the constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that's all we need to know.	0
ClaimBuster	2103	And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.	1
ClaimBuster	2104	They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months.	0
ClaimBuster	2105	So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	2106	He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A.	1
ClaimBuster	2107	I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there.	0
ClaimBuster	2108	But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	2109	We both believe that, as lawyers -- I'm a lawyer, too.	0
ClaimBuster	2110	And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.	1
ClaimBuster	2111	We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.	0
ClaimBuster	2112	And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight.	0
ClaimBuster	2113	One is to reduce spending -- controlling that mandatory spending.	0
ClaimBuster	2114	Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2115	Senator Obama's name was not on that letter.	1
ClaimBuster	2116	We do have a serious problem in our culture.	0
ClaimBuster	2117	I talk to small businesses across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	2118	So far, Mr. Ford has not responded.	1
ClaimBuster	2119	But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.	0
ClaimBuster	2120	I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.	0
ClaimBuster	2121	We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	2122	I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way.	0
ClaimBuster	2123	This is a formidable force.	0
ClaimBuster	2124	We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.	1
ClaimBuster	2125	"'', he said, ""Cut those things I asked for but didn't get.''"	1
ClaimBuster	2126	See, an educated child is one much more likely to be hopeful and optimistic.	0
ClaimBuster	2127	President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.	1
ClaimBuster	2128	I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say I'm happy to be here with Tipper and our family.	0
ClaimBuster	2129	I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.	0
ClaimBuster	2130	I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.	1
ClaimBuster	2131	Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.	0
ClaimBuster	2132	The plan says we'll train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are.	1
ClaimBuster	2133	And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how.	0
ClaimBuster	2134	Thank you for doing what you're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	2135	I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	2136	But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.	1
ClaimBuster	2137	This is another example of misplaced priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	2138	And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	2139	Number two, trade -- I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	2140	But you were in contact -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	2141	Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself.	0
ClaimBuster	2142	I'm optimistic we'll achieve -- I know we won't achieve if we send mixed signals.	0
ClaimBuster	2143	And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect.	0
ClaimBuster	2144	Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?	0
ClaimBuster	2145	That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.	0
ClaimBuster	2146	We have to be firm and strong.	0
ClaimBuster	2147	Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2148	No, it doesn't speak for itself, Mr. Vice President, it speaks for the fact that there are certain rules in this that we all agree to, but evidently rules don't mean anything.	0
ClaimBuster	2149	Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.	0
ClaimBuster	2150	Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they're severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	2151	I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.	0
ClaimBuster	2152	You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	2153	I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	2154	I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.	0
ClaimBuster	2155	Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent.	1
ClaimBuster	2156	We'll continue to build our alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	2157	So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.	1
ClaimBuster	2158	Well, you know, let me just...	0
ClaimBuster	2159	He's trying to attack me.	1
ClaimBuster	2160	That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs.	0
ClaimBuster	2161	We've got to invest in science and technology.	0
ClaimBuster	2162	The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.	1
ClaimBuster	2163	So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.	0
ClaimBuster	2164	It is the best anti-terrorist report written.	0
ClaimBuster	2165	We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	2166	And that's not how a commander in chief acts.	0
ClaimBuster	2167	And I supported this bill.	1
ClaimBuster	2168	Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand.	0
ClaimBuster	2169	They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.	1
ClaimBuster	2170	And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.	0
ClaimBuster	2171	He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	2172	Did you ask me a question?	0
ClaimBuster	2173	Can I respond to that?	0
ClaimBuster	2174	I will bring our energy companies back.	0
ClaimBuster	2175	But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	2176	The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.	1
ClaimBuster	2177	Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	2178	They investigated every single one of my children.	1
ClaimBuster	2179	Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	2180	But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.	1
ClaimBuster	2181	And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.	0
ClaimBuster	2182	If people don't have the stomach to fix these problems, I think it's a good time to face it, November.	0
ClaimBuster	2183	The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.	0
ClaimBuster	2184	I can't think of any.	0
ClaimBuster	2185	So how do we deal with it?	0
ClaimBuster	2186	I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college.	0
ClaimBuster	2187	The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred.	0
ClaimBuster	2188	One of the things that happens when you're a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	2189	And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.	1
ClaimBuster	2190	Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America.	0
ClaimBuster	2191	And it's referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted.	1
ClaimBuster	2192	We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America.	0
ClaimBuster	2193	We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	2194	I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	2195	Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.	1
ClaimBuster	2196	In other states, we've done it.	1
ClaimBuster	2197	We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	2198	The -- I haven't seen that, in my commercials?	0
ClaimBuster	2199	I don't think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights.	0
ClaimBuster	2200	That's why we doubled clean -- clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.	1
ClaimBuster	2201	How many of you like it?	0
ClaimBuster	2202	Some people say that's a hatchet.	0
ClaimBuster	2203	You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.	1
ClaimBuster	2204	You see, I don't think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say that's going to make the problem better.	0
ClaimBuster	2205	As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement.	1
ClaimBuster	2206	It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.	1
ClaimBuster	2207	"And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president."	1
ClaimBuster	2208	Here a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry.	1
ClaimBuster	2209	But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, I'll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures.	0
ClaimBuster	2210	And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	2211	But we know we've got lots of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2212	We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there.	1
ClaimBuster	2213	But let's not cut into the muscle, and let's not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made.	1
ClaimBuster	2214	So I would think we can expedite the problem there.	0
ClaimBuster	2215	It's now over $10 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	2216	And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.	0
ClaimBuster	2217	The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.	0
ClaimBuster	2218	And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.	0
ClaimBuster	2219	And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.	0
ClaimBuster	2220	Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.	0
ClaimBuster	2221	We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	2222	And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.	0
ClaimBuster	2223	The President didn't have much to do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2224	But here's what I do know.	0
ClaimBuster	2225	Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.	1
ClaimBuster	2226	The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.	1
ClaimBuster	2227	They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong?	0
ClaimBuster	2228	That's not the position he's taking.	1
ClaimBuster	2229	There's a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections.	1
ClaimBuster	2230	We've looked at your tax proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	2231	All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.	0
ClaimBuster	2232	You keep your own insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	2233	And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2234	They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	2235	I'm not going to ask them.	0
ClaimBuster	2236	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.	1
ClaimBuster	2237	You don't see Margaret Tutwiler sitting in there with me today.	1
ClaimBuster	2238	Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	2239	And women have respect for me.	0
ClaimBuster	2240	I have a great company.	0
ClaimBuster	2241	We - uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years.	1
ClaimBuster	2242	We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.	0
ClaimBuster	2243	I believe that public service is honorable.	0
ClaimBuster	2244	He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School.	1
ClaimBuster	2245	They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.	0
ClaimBuster	2246	And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	2247	It's about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	2248	"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."	0
ClaimBuster	2249	That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	2250	Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann.	0
ClaimBuster	2251	I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	2252	Well, I certainly hope not.	0
ClaimBuster	2253	And we're going to put our laboratories and our colleges and our universities to work.	0
ClaimBuster	2254	We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.	0
ClaimBuster	2255	And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.	1
ClaimBuster	2256	And I've done everything I could in my public life to overcome racial divisions.	0
ClaimBuster	2257	They've taken over the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	2258	"And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan's ""trust, but verify,"" and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, it's just dangerous."	1
ClaimBuster	2259	... withdrawal would be dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	2260	Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	2261	That's what I'm all about.	0
ClaimBuster	2262	Now here's what we need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2263	I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.	0
ClaimBuster	2264	And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	2265	Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?	0
ClaimBuster	2266	Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	2267	I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.	0
ClaimBuster	2268	This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.	1
ClaimBuster	2269	But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2270	I believe in free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	2271	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	2272	This is a difficult and sensitive matter.	0
ClaimBuster	2273	There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been wrong on a number of the major ones.	1
ClaimBuster	2274	It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	2275	And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.	0
ClaimBuster	2276	We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.	1
ClaimBuster	2277	And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.	1
ClaimBuster	2278	And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance.	0
ClaimBuster	2279	In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.	1
ClaimBuster	2280	Well, a lot of what this campaign is about, it seems to me Bernie, goes to the question of values.	0
ClaimBuster	2281	When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.	0
ClaimBuster	2282	Jim, thank you very much.	0
ClaimBuster	2283	Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.	0
ClaimBuster	2284	He has all the conspiracy theories...	0
ClaimBuster	2285	People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed.	0
ClaimBuster	2286	I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input.	1
ClaimBuster	2287	"But to somehow say that group of young women who said ""Military wives for McCain"" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens."	0
ClaimBuster	2288	Whether that helps or not, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	2289	Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	2290	But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.	0
ClaimBuster	2291	And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.	1
ClaimBuster	2292	You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.	1
ClaimBuster	2293	And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think?	0
ClaimBuster	2294	High tech executives in Northern California.	1
ClaimBuster	2295	See, there's a lot I don't understand.	0
ClaimBuster	2296	I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.	1
ClaimBuster	2297	But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.	0
ClaimBuster	2298	So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.	0
ClaimBuster	2299	And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.	0
ClaimBuster	2300	There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.	0
ClaimBuster	2301	I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.	0
ClaimBuster	2302	But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.	1
ClaimBuster	2303	"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''"	0
ClaimBuster	2304	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	1
ClaimBuster	2305	"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true."	1
ClaimBuster	2306	And if he should ever become uh - the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	2307	We have to double the size of the Afghan army.	0
ClaimBuster	2308	In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and we've set high standards in the executive branch of the government.	0
ClaimBuster	2309	A promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to become your president.	0
ClaimBuster	2310	And if you watch it Thursday, Friday, Saturday this week, you'll get more.	0
ClaimBuster	2311	"His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, ""We're going to encourage self-deportation."""	1
ClaimBuster	2312	You know, here's what I would say.	0
ClaimBuster	2313	All right, here we go again.	0
ClaimBuster	2314	Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.	0
ClaimBuster	2315	Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	2316	They don't reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	2317	This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.	1
ClaimBuster	2318	Mine are words, and his was action.	0
ClaimBuster	2319	In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength to preserve the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	2320	We were there for the better part of a year.	1
ClaimBuster	2321	OK. We need to create jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	2322	This president chose a tax cut over homeland security.	1
ClaimBuster	2323	We had a good neighbor policy, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	2324	But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.	1
ClaimBuster	2325	There are plenty of places to cut.	0
ClaimBuster	2326	The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	2327	Well, let me just say I would...	0
ClaimBuster	2328	And my plan say why don't we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills?	0
ClaimBuster	2329	They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	2330	But we can't just provide moral support.	0
ClaimBuster	2331	So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student.	0
ClaimBuster	2332	When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.	1
ClaimBuster	2333	But that's not what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	2334	But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.	0
ClaimBuster	2335	I believe we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2336	The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2337	I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.	0
ClaimBuster	2338	We've seen in the Nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our country in that region.	0
ClaimBuster	2339	Actually, Mr. President, in 1997 we fixed Medicare, and I was one of the people involved in it.	1
ClaimBuster	2340	But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	2341	I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.	1
ClaimBuster	2342	It's not driven by politics.	1
ClaimBuster	2343	We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	2344	The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2345	I believe in opening doors.	0
ClaimBuster	2346	There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.	1
ClaimBuster	2347	There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.	0
ClaimBuster	2348	In fact, I'm for shrinking the size of government.	1
ClaimBuster	2349	If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.	0
ClaimBuster	2350	We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	2351	The farm income in America is high.	1
ClaimBuster	2352	But we also have to take demand seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	2353	These appointments are for life.	1
ClaimBuster	2354	I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.	0
ClaimBuster	2355	I want to finally get something done on Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	2356	Let me get out of your way here.	0
ClaimBuster	2357	The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.	1
ClaimBuster	2358	Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking -- taking care of business here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	2359	I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2360	You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	2361	But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	2362	You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated.	1
ClaimBuster	2363	I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.	0
ClaimBuster	2364	I don't think he was misleading.	0
ClaimBuster	2365	Well, we have come to that position.	0
ClaimBuster	2366	But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them.	0
ClaimBuster	2367	But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	2368	So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	2369	I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.	1
ClaimBuster	2370	You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?	0
ClaimBuster	2371	I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	2372	And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	2373	Those are the people who ought to be in jail.	0
ClaimBuster	2374	It's a good package, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	2375	Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	2376	You'll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question.	0
ClaimBuster	2377	And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?	0
ClaimBuster	2378	I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	2379	I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	2380	I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another.	0
ClaimBuster	2381	more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.	1
ClaimBuster	2382	That's because it comes at you, not from you.	0
ClaimBuster	2383	And I wish we had time to let me explain.	0
ClaimBuster	2384	And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet.	0
ClaimBuster	2385	This is what this election is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	2386	Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission.	0
ClaimBuster	2387	It says, for example, that a woman doesn't have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist.	1
ClaimBuster	2388	Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	2389	We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.	0
ClaimBuster	2390	But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	2391	Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.	1
ClaimBuster	2392	And as a consequence, Al Qaeda's core leadership has been decimated.	1
ClaimBuster	2393	You know, we are at a defining moment in our history.	0
ClaimBuster	2394	But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success.	0
ClaimBuster	2395	We've got ten and a half million new jobs; we've got record numbers of those new small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	2396	I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families.	0
ClaimBuster	2397	So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief - would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?	0
ClaimBuster	2398	And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	2399	Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her.	1
ClaimBuster	2400	I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	2401	I've been able to set clear goals.	0
ClaimBuster	2402	We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	2403	You know what that is?	0
ClaimBuster	2404	Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	2405	But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.	0
ClaimBuster	2406	So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.	0
ClaimBuster	2407	Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me.	0
ClaimBuster	2408	The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.	0
ClaimBuster	2409	You're doing a great job, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	2410	We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	2411	I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.	0
ClaimBuster	2412	Governor Carter again contradicts himself.	0
ClaimBuster	2413	Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	2414	Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.	1
ClaimBuster	2415	And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.	0
ClaimBuster	2416	We need to go after the leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	2417	That is a rank mischaracterization.	0
ClaimBuster	2418	We had Saddam Hussein trapped.	1
ClaimBuster	2419	We've got to invest in college affordability.	0
ClaimBuster	2420	You judge on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	2421	It must -- as a last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	2422	I just want to get back to this home ownership.	0
ClaimBuster	2423	I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	2424	And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	2425	So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.	0
ClaimBuster	2426	I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.	0
ClaimBuster	2427	Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	2428	And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.	1
ClaimBuster	2429	But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	2430	My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.	1
ClaimBuster	2431	American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2432	I'll get our incomes up.	0
ClaimBuster	2433	The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot.	0
ClaimBuster	2434	In the rest of the world, the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way.	0
ClaimBuster	2435	And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	2436	People are stopped, and we have to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	2437	We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.	0
ClaimBuster	2438	We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	2439	There's no question about that.	0
ClaimBuster	2440	Hiring people temporarily who have lost their jobs and they get to work for 30 days or 60 days.	1
ClaimBuster	2441	Let's go back to the tax and budget summit briefly.	0
ClaimBuster	2442	That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?	0
ClaimBuster	2443	And we're asking to be able to allow you to get them.	0
ClaimBuster	2444	The world -- let me tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	2445	If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.	0
ClaimBuster	2446	It's obvious that there are certain things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	2447	And there are two very different paths the country can take.	0
ClaimBuster	2448	And sadly, she doesn't have that.	0
ClaimBuster	2449	"I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called ""The New War,"" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network."	1
ClaimBuster	2450	I hope they're not awful things.	0
ClaimBuster	2451	She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	2452	Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending.	0
ClaimBuster	2453	And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	2454	I was able to do that in my state and bring these two together.	0
ClaimBuster	2455	And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	2456	That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	2457	That's what President Clinton did.	1
ClaimBuster	2458	In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.	0
ClaimBuster	2459	It's now four years later.	1
ClaimBuster	2460	Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.	0
ClaimBuster	2461	In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.	1
ClaimBuster	2462	There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	2463	On Social Security he's not.	0
ClaimBuster	2464	That wasn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	2465	I said I'm opposed to discrimination.	1
ClaimBuster	2466	And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.	1
ClaimBuster	2467	And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.	0
ClaimBuster	2468	And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.	0
ClaimBuster	2469	I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2470	This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.	0
ClaimBuster	2471	That's why I think I'll win.	0
ClaimBuster	2472	And everything in there says what I am for.	0
ClaimBuster	2473	My opponent says he hadn't changed his position on it.	1
ClaimBuster	2474	That's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	2475	It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.	1
ClaimBuster	2476	But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2477	He had two terms in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	2478	And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.	0
ClaimBuster	2479	We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.	1
ClaimBuster	2480	President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.	1
ClaimBuster	2481	But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile.	1
ClaimBuster	2482	Why did our government do it?	0
ClaimBuster	2483	But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.	0
ClaimBuster	2484	If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.	1
ClaimBuster	2485	It's my - my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	2486	Now, that's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	2487	I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	2488	And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.	1
ClaimBuster	2489	I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today.	0
ClaimBuster	2490	I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	2491	Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder.	1
ClaimBuster	2492	He is the chairman of the health committee.	1
ClaimBuster	2493	And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.	1
ClaimBuster	2494	We can get this economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	2495	And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.	0
ClaimBuster	2496	If you're a Medicare person, on Medicare, you don't get the new procedures.	1
ClaimBuster	2497	Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either.	1
ClaimBuster	2498	Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2499	His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.	1
ClaimBuster	2500	First of all, most of good governance is at the state level.	0
ClaimBuster	2501	The Russians can't believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	2502	We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.	1
ClaimBuster	2503	And in some cases may be still at large.	0
ClaimBuster	2504	The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.	0
ClaimBuster	2505	Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	2506	Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	2507	We have cut inflation by better than half.	1
ClaimBuster	2508	I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	2509	That was in an ad, Jim, that was knocked down by the journalists who analyzed the ad and said it was misleading.	1
ClaimBuster	2510	I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on.	1
ClaimBuster	2511	If we got along well, that would be good.	0
ClaimBuster	2512	The president -- and this is one of the reasons why I am very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the president's father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovo, supporting me; because they all -- and General Baca, who was the head of the National Guard, supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	2513	I don't dislike trial lawyers.	0
ClaimBuster	2514	The president broke the pay-as-you-go rule.	1
ClaimBuster	2515	It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth.	1
ClaimBuster	2516	The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff.	1
ClaimBuster	2517	As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.	1
ClaimBuster	2518	Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	2519	Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.	0
ClaimBuster	2520	That happened long before I arrived in Washington, D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	2521	We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.	1
ClaimBuster	2522	Many of her friends took bigger deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	2523	We can have health care for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2524	Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	2525	So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.	0
ClaimBuster	2526	Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	2527	This is a great country.	0
ClaimBuster	2528	The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing.	1
ClaimBuster	2529	You can't be on one hand this way and one hand another.	0
ClaimBuster	2530	There's a -- no, look, there's a systemic problem.	0
ClaimBuster	2531	But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues -- trying to be one thing to one person here that's opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it -- what we call waffling.	1
ClaimBuster	2532	And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	2533	... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.	1
ClaimBuster	2534	He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing.	1
ClaimBuster	2535	In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it.	0
ClaimBuster	2536	And I will stand up for that right.	0
ClaimBuster	2537	Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.	0
ClaimBuster	2538	And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd.	1
ClaimBuster	2539	We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking.	1
ClaimBuster	2540	So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.	0
ClaimBuster	2541	And that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis.	1
ClaimBuster	2542	With the United States, as he said, not so much.	1
ClaimBuster	2543	Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.	0
ClaimBuster	2544	I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	2545	We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.	0
ClaimBuster	2546	Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat.	0
ClaimBuster	2547	Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.	1
ClaimBuster	2548	And I do think that you can't turn the White House into the Waffle House.	0
ClaimBuster	2549	I've voted eight, ten times since 1965.	1
ClaimBuster	2550	The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	2551	I didn't favor it when it was in, started.	0
ClaimBuster	2552	Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described.	1
ClaimBuster	2553	And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates?	0
ClaimBuster	2554	We live-we bring everybody along.	0
ClaimBuster	2555	I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	2556	Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	2557	But we have an opportunity -- we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal.	1
ClaimBuster	2558	As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him.	0
ClaimBuster	2559	Well, it is an open discussion.	0
ClaimBuster	2560	We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	2561	The governors -- and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this -- but maybe -- I don't want to invoke him here.	0
ClaimBuster	2562	But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	2563	Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.	0
ClaimBuster	2564	We have to help these nations create civil societies.	0
ClaimBuster	2565	You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.	0
ClaimBuster	2566	It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	2567	I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money.	0
ClaimBuster	2568	Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.	0
ClaimBuster	2569	... or at an airport near you.	0
ClaimBuster	2570	We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.	0
ClaimBuster	2571	That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	2572	Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	2573	It was killed in the Rules Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	2574	In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	2575	And the president should lead a national effort to change behavior, to keep our children alive in the schools, responsible behavior to keep people alive.	0
ClaimBuster	2576	In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.	0
ClaimBuster	2577	I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that.	1
ClaimBuster	2578	Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion.	0
ClaimBuster	2579	But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case.	0
ClaimBuster	2580	I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though.	0
ClaimBuster	2581	It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles.	0
ClaimBuster	2582	Thank you, and good night.	0
ClaimBuster	2583	As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.	1
ClaimBuster	2584	Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	2585	I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents.	0
ClaimBuster	2586	And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2587	I went to Washington to solve problems.	1
ClaimBuster	2588	And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --	0
ClaimBuster	2589	We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	2590	And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile.	1
ClaimBuster	2591	For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.	0
ClaimBuster	2592	And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	2593	I don√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers √É‚Äö $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	2594	And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.	0
ClaimBuster	2595	Spending was only up something like 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2596	And now we hear a lot of talk, oh, well, we all want enterprise zones, and yet the House and the Senate can't send it down without loading it up with a lot of, you know, these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	2597	I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford.	0
ClaimBuster	2598	"But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. """	0
ClaimBuster	2599	It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?	0
ClaimBuster	2600	They can't live in the community which they grew up in.	0
ClaimBuster	2601	So, I don't want to fool around with it.	0
ClaimBuster	2602	"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice."""	1
ClaimBuster	2603	Let me say at the outset, uh - I'm very proud of the record of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	2604	I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.	0
ClaimBuster	2605	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	2606	That's working with other nations.	0
ClaimBuster	2607	The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.	1
ClaimBuster	2608	There's just a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	2609	And we're more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	2610	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	2611	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	0
ClaimBuster	2612	If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages.	0
ClaimBuster	2613	I have a plan to cover those folks.	1
ClaimBuster	2614	A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.	0
ClaimBuster	2615	And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	2616	And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	2617	Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	2618	Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.	1
ClaimBuster	2619	Well, I would repeal and replace it.	0
ClaimBuster	2620	Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis.	1
ClaimBuster	2621	Those things will get us the energy we need.	0
ClaimBuster	2622	It was the largest expansion of private insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	2623	This is something I take seriously and that's my position.	0
ClaimBuster	2624	I've worked on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person up here who hasn't been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	2625	I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.	0
ClaimBuster	2626	I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.	1
ClaimBuster	2627	And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	2628	We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products.	1
ClaimBuster	2629	The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.	0
ClaimBuster	2630	Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	2631	We've been drifting too long.	0
ClaimBuster	2632	And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.	1
ClaimBuster	2633	I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help.	0
ClaimBuster	2634	And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort.	1
ClaimBuster	2635	If I make a mistake, I admit it.	0
ClaimBuster	2636	I'm against quotas, they're illegal.	0
ClaimBuster	2637	We're working hard to sign up children.	0
ClaimBuster	2638	And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...	1
ClaimBuster	2639	But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us.	1
ClaimBuster	2640	And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.	1
ClaimBuster	2641	Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan.	1
ClaimBuster	2642	Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	2643	But time is our friend there, because their leaders will change in not too many years, worst case, and their country is making great progress.	0
ClaimBuster	2644	We're down to 336 ships.	1
ClaimBuster	2645	People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice.	1
ClaimBuster	2646	Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	2647	We got to cut it out.	0
ClaimBuster	2648	We may differ about what the elements of that are.	0
ClaimBuster	2649	we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	2650	I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.	0
ClaimBuster	2651	And that's what the No Child Left Behind Act does.	0
ClaimBuster	2652	If we're going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and we've had more deployments under this administration than any time in history.	0
ClaimBuster	2653	It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.	0
ClaimBuster	2654	Well, let me just follow up, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	2655	He called them coerced and the bribed.	1
ClaimBuster	2656	We're a country of laws.	0
ClaimBuster	2657	I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards.	0
ClaimBuster	2658	So we got to be guarded in our generosity.	0
ClaimBuster	2659	They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	2660	But John is right we have to make cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	2661	That's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care.	0
ClaimBuster	2662	Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans.	0
ClaimBuster	2663	Let's be honest about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2664	In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.	0
ClaimBuster	2665	But there are limits to what we can spend.	0
ClaimBuster	2666	America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.	0
ClaimBuster	2667	Then I would really focus on let's get these things out.	0
ClaimBuster	2668	And that is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	2669	So I think our selection uh - of Bob Dole as vice president uh - is based on merit.	0
ClaimBuster	2670	That makes life a lot easier.	0
ClaimBuster	2671	We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	2672	But no, I'm for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.	0
ClaimBuster	2673	We've got to remain energy-independent.	0
ClaimBuster	2674	And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	2675	We hammerlock the American companies -- American Airlines, Delta -- the last few great we have, because we're trying to do this deal with these 2 European companies.	1
ClaimBuster	2676	There's no way for our people now to understand what their government is.	0
ClaimBuster	2677	Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	2678	I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.	0
ClaimBuster	2679	Is our relative strength growing?	0
ClaimBuster	2680	And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	2681	I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?	0
ClaimBuster	2682	If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2683	And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.	0
ClaimBuster	2684	The trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the president vetoes it for them.	1
ClaimBuster	2685	Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds.	0
ClaimBuster	2686	This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	2687	But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.	0
ClaimBuster	2688	"The ""we"" is you and me."	0
ClaimBuster	2689	I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	2690	I will not cut benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	2691	So, under the circumstances, what do we do?	0
ClaimBuster	2692	Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today.	1
ClaimBuster	2693	You do a lot of things nobody knows about.	0
ClaimBuster	2694	We don't want to get drawn into a military conflict.	0
ClaimBuster	2695	And one last thing -- just -- just to make this point.	0
ClaimBuster	2696	In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.	0
ClaimBuster	2697	I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.	0
ClaimBuster	2698	And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	2699	This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	2700	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.	1
ClaimBuster	2701	Can you say that a little louder, Candy?	0
ClaimBuster	2702	We have to work with Nigeria.	0
ClaimBuster	2703	"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""	1
ClaimBuster	2704	You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.	0
ClaimBuster	2705	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.	1
ClaimBuster	2706	Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day.	0
ClaimBuster	2707	We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	2708	I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years.	1
ClaimBuster	2709	All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.	1
ClaimBuster	2710	Now, we may not succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	2711	Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed.	0
ClaimBuster	2712	Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened.	0
ClaimBuster	2713	Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.	0
ClaimBuster	2714	But let's get at the bottom line.	0
ClaimBuster	2715	And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.	0
ClaimBuster	2716	--notwithstanding my opponent's ad, my plan triggers in at gross incomes, family incomes of $200,000 and above.	1
ClaimBuster	2717	We are not at war with Islam.	1
ClaimBuster	2718	I hope not in both cases.	0
ClaimBuster	2719	And -- and I -- I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and -- and he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources, and -- and those terrible things may well happen from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	2720	And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.	1
ClaimBuster	2721	I would like to know from the governor -- I know we're not supposed to ask each other questions -- but I'd be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?	0
ClaimBuster	2722	And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.	0
ClaimBuster	2723	And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.	1
ClaimBuster	2724	I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	2725	That will change when I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	2726	I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	2727	"With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say ""never.''"	0
ClaimBuster	2728	I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	2729	And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2730	So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	2731	We need to do better in job retraining.	0
ClaimBuster	2732	And the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith.	0
ClaimBuster	2733	I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.	1
ClaimBuster	2734	And my program is this.	0
ClaimBuster	2735	I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.	0
ClaimBuster	2736	Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	0
ClaimBuster	2737	The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security?	0
ClaimBuster	2738	Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	2739	That's not the right course for America.	0
ClaimBuster	2740	For instance, we're flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	2741	And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	2742	Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women.	1
ClaimBuster	2743	He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.	0
ClaimBuster	2744	And if you have some of each -- and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom.	0
ClaimBuster	2745	We're trying to solve it.	0
ClaimBuster	2746	You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	2747	Pardon means that what you did, whether it's right or wrong, you're forgiven for it.	1
ClaimBuster	2748	So that is not the way our democracy works.	0
ClaimBuster	2749	But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	2750	The American people don't know what those commitments are.	0
ClaimBuster	2751	These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan.	1
ClaimBuster	2752	That's why we say mutual and verifiable freezes.	0
ClaimBuster	2753	Was it the right thing to do?	0
ClaimBuster	2754	It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.	0
ClaimBuster	2755	Second, he's wrong in the analogies that he makes.	0
ClaimBuster	2756	I think that this farm policy has failed.	0
ClaimBuster	2757	I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.	1
ClaimBuster	2758	He was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasn't been sent to Congress in total; three years before an economic plan, and he still didn't say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break -- but he vetoed it anyway.	1
ClaimBuster	2759	And we work with those other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	2760	First thing I'm going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure we're not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2761	I think you put your finger on a major problem.	0
ClaimBuster	2762	But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	2763	Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2764	Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what's in the rescue package for you.	0
ClaimBuster	2765	They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.	0
ClaimBuster	2766	Now, results is what counts.	0
ClaimBuster	2767	Convention, the VFW National Convention - when I spoke to each of those bodies - I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses.	1
ClaimBuster	2768	We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.	0
ClaimBuster	2769	And that's exactly what I have proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	2770	And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.	0
ClaimBuster	2771	This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.	0
ClaimBuster	2772	But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.	1
ClaimBuster	2773	Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	2774	I don't favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	2775	And I am not apologetic at all about our record with women.	0
ClaimBuster	2776	But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?	0
ClaimBuster	2777	Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.	0
ClaimBuster	2778	Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work.	0
ClaimBuster	2779	OK, so it hasn't fallen.	0
ClaimBuster	2780	He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn't happen.	1
ClaimBuster	2781	And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	2782	As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	2783	Senator Kennedy is in the hospital.	1
ClaimBuster	2784	So let's not be throwing stones about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2785	We're making really good progress.	0
ClaimBuster	2786	It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	2787	But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.	1
ClaimBuster	2788	Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.	1
ClaimBuster	2789	The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.	1
ClaimBuster	2790	Energy independence for North America in five years.	0
ClaimBuster	2791	Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse.	1
ClaimBuster	2792	He founded authored, the job training partnership act.	1
ClaimBuster	2793	Now that sounds to me a little bit different.	0
ClaimBuster	2794	But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	2795	Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.	0
ClaimBuster	2796	And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.	0
ClaimBuster	2797	That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	2798	Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	2799	So I would be firm.	0
ClaimBuster	2800	And so please, go to...	0
ClaimBuster	2801	And then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?	0
ClaimBuster	2802	Is that a -- is that a separate topic?	0
ClaimBuster	2803	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.	0
ClaimBuster	2804	And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	2805	And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.	0
ClaimBuster	2806	I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.	1
ClaimBuster	2807	That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.	0
ClaimBuster	2808	And housing has begun to rise.	1
ClaimBuster	2809	They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.	0
ClaimBuster	2810	I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.	0
ClaimBuster	2811	That's the kind of approach that will work.	0
ClaimBuster	2812	At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.	1
ClaimBuster	2813	And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	2814	And there's nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace.	0
ClaimBuster	2815	I believe that discipline and respect for the law -- all of these things should be taught to children, not in our schools, but families have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	2816	It's not just more troops.	0
ClaimBuster	2817	I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	2818	Now, you cite a study.	1
ClaimBuster	2819	Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies.	0
ClaimBuster	2820	And then that number disappears for high-income people.	1
ClaimBuster	2821	[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	2822	Now, just remember when you think about me -- I didn't create this mess.	0
ClaimBuster	2823	We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history.	0
ClaimBuster	2824	When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam.	1
ClaimBuster	2825	When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.	1
ClaimBuster	2826	I don't think it's the issues that turn kids off.	0
ClaimBuster	2827	And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.	0
ClaimBuster	2828	My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	2829	We will do what we do best.	0
ClaimBuster	2830	He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.	1
ClaimBuster	2831	Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	2832	He said the standard bearer wasn't for it.	1
ClaimBuster	2833	Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.	0
ClaimBuster	2834	It's critical to our future.	0
ClaimBuster	2835	He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.	0
ClaimBuster	2836	We have to start to spend the money now.	0
ClaimBuster	2837	The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	2838	But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.	0
ClaimBuster	2839	How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?	0
ClaimBuster	2840	There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.	1
ClaimBuster	2841	I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	2842	I guess I rely more on the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	2843	And I would cite again Dan Quayle.	0
ClaimBuster	2844	I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.	1
ClaimBuster	2845	I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections.	1
ClaimBuster	2846	I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.	0
ClaimBuster	2847	And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.	0
ClaimBuster	2848	"""Those are the three words that she left me with."	1
ClaimBuster	2849	And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.	0
ClaimBuster	2850	We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.	0
ClaimBuster	2851	We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.	0
ClaimBuster	2852	In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.	0
ClaimBuster	2853	The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.	1
ClaimBuster	2854	He said, we will look at offshore drilling.	1
ClaimBuster	2855	I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.	0
ClaimBuster	2856	The opportunities that the child will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.	0
ClaimBuster	2857	Uh - the Department of uh - uh - HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh - outlaws, that takes care of redlining.	1
ClaimBuster	2858	So hold the line on Social Security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program.	0
ClaimBuster	2859	We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be.	1
ClaimBuster	2860	It's clear for everybody to see.	0
ClaimBuster	2861	I've visited so many communities.	1
ClaimBuster	2862	Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	2863	I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way.	1
ClaimBuster	2864	We couldn't get it done, because I wasn't enforceable.	0
ClaimBuster	2865	Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them.	1
ClaimBuster	2866	Do you want to give me some suggestions?	0
ClaimBuster	2867	I want to thank the League of Women Voters, the good citizens of Kansas City, and President Reagan for agreeing to debate this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	2868	High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	2869	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	1
ClaimBuster	2870	But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	2871	Going to be more deaths that they thought.	0
ClaimBuster	2872	I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.	0
ClaimBuster	2873	I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.	1
ClaimBuster	2874	Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	2875	Four of them here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	2876	One of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business.	1
ClaimBuster	2877	She's got experience, but it's bad experience.	0
ClaimBuster	2878	Secondly, allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2879	But history will look back, and I'm fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration, because the president makes the decisions, the president has to take the responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	2880	Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there.	1
ClaimBuster	2881	What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.	0
ClaimBuster	2882	The world is more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	2883	I believe that's the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	2884	Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	2885	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	0
ClaimBuster	2886	What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them.	1
ClaimBuster	2887	"He keeps talking about, ""Let the inspectors do their job."""	0
ClaimBuster	2888	I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people.	0
ClaimBuster	2889	Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	2890	Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon.	0
ClaimBuster	2891	And I want to talk about my plan some more -- I hope we can.	0
ClaimBuster	2892	Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.	0
ClaimBuster	2893	I agree that the surplus is the American people's money, it's your money.	0
ClaimBuster	2894	The president has a great responsibility.	1
ClaimBuster	2895	Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	2896	We'll be on again Saturday night, 8 to 9 o'clock on ABC.	1
ClaimBuster	2897	The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability.	0
ClaimBuster	2898	Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	2899	And so I just have a different approach.	0
ClaimBuster	2900	I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	2901	We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains.	1
ClaimBuster	2902	And we admire your pluck and perseverance.	0
ClaimBuster	2903	And we've focused on the tactical.	0
ClaimBuster	2904	That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.	0
ClaimBuster	2905	So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who's still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working.	0
ClaimBuster	2906	Mr. Corddry, it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present.	0
ClaimBuster	2907	I think that's about a realistic timeframe.	0
ClaimBuster	2908	My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?	0
ClaimBuster	2909	And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.	0
ClaimBuster	2910	All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it - just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country - urban .	0
ClaimBuster	2911	They put up the American flag.	0
ClaimBuster	2912	Now we have to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	2913	Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.	1
ClaimBuster	2914	Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	2915	We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.	0
ClaimBuster	2916	Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	2917	There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.	1
ClaimBuster	2918	Doing better in the neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	2919	We're headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration.	0
ClaimBuster	2920	I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator.	0
ClaimBuster	2921	So it's adding to cost.	1
ClaimBuster	2922	Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	2923	I've got a plan on Medicare, for example, that's a two-stage plan that says we'll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program.	1
ClaimBuster	2924	I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies.	0
ClaimBuster	2925	He got a notice or he didn't.	0
ClaimBuster	2926	I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and makes some discipline and protects the taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	2927	I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	2928	There's no -- and we have to do them all at once.	0
ClaimBuster	2929	We've got home ownership at a 15-year high.	1
ClaimBuster	2930	Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.	1
ClaimBuster	2931	You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.	1
ClaimBuster	2932	He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.	0
ClaimBuster	2933	We're going to block grant into the states.	0
ClaimBuster	2934	That's not a grand coalition.	0
ClaimBuster	2935	And yet Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	2936	We're still down 580,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	2937	Brady Bill, I agree that it's a timid step in the right direction but it won't fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	2938	There have been some tough cases come across my desk.	0
ClaimBuster	2939	Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	2940	I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think we've come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off.	0
ClaimBuster	2941	Now, for four years that's what I worked on.	1
ClaimBuster	2942	Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.	1
ClaimBuster	2943	One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.	0
ClaimBuster	2944	We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	2945	Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.	0
ClaimBuster	2946	This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2947	It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel.	0
ClaimBuster	2948	We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.	0
ClaimBuster	2949	And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	2950	If I'm president, I'll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska.	0
ClaimBuster	2951	But we are putting our energy companies out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	2952	And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2953	This is an issue they've brought up.	1
ClaimBuster	2954	Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer.	1
ClaimBuster	2955	They just write a note for the interest.	0
ClaimBuster	2956	We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.	1
ClaimBuster	2957	And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.	0
ClaimBuster	2958	And we ought to expand our markets abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	2959	Well, first, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut.	0
ClaimBuster	2960	We have a big program in my state that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school.	1
ClaimBuster	2961	We've got to treat it as international crime.	0
ClaimBuster	2962	And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.	1
ClaimBuster	2963	Nuclear is the single greatest threat.	0
ClaimBuster	2964	Well, that just isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	2965	But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.	0
ClaimBuster	2966	That's part of my health care plan.	1
ClaimBuster	2967	Let me just say, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	2968	We've opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I've been president.	1
ClaimBuster	2969	That doesn't restrict people's freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	2970	Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.	1
ClaimBuster	2971	I met a man who spent eight months in prison, wasn't even allowed to call his lawyer, wasn't allowed to get -- finally, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois intervened and was able to get him out.	1
ClaimBuster	2972	A lot remains to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	2973	I'm happy to do that, too.	0
ClaimBuster	2974	I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela.	0
ClaimBuster	2975	It's not good for the country and it's not right.	0
ClaimBuster	2976	Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president.	1
ClaimBuster	2977	But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.	0
ClaimBuster	2978	Pakistan is -- is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now.	0
ClaimBuster	2979	The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	2980	I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.	1
ClaimBuster	2981	How do you get anything done when you've got all of these political action committees, all of these thousands of registered lobbyists -- 40,000 registered lobbyists, 23,000 special interest groups -- and the list goes on and on and on.	1
ClaimBuster	2982	I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2983	And that's a whole lot different from these fellows running up and down the halls whispering in their ears now and promising campaign funds for the next election if they do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2984	And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	2985	I did support the '76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation.	1
ClaimBuster	2986	I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	2987	I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don't believe...	0
ClaimBuster	2988	I've recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn't do anything wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	2989	You were totally in favor of it.	1
ClaimBuster	2990	I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that.	0
ClaimBuster	2991	See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.	0
ClaimBuster	2992	The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	2993	Then you said we should.	1
ClaimBuster	2994	To me, that's the best way to secure America.	0
ClaimBuster	2995	We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.	0
ClaimBuster	2996	I came away convinced that, if we worked at it, if we were ready to work and letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, they'd be there with us.	0
ClaimBuster	2997	Maybe that was the purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	2998	The place where we've seen manufacturing go has been China.	1
ClaimBuster	2999	But have no doubt that Russia's behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become, because of their petro dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	3000	We just have a different philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	3001	But let's not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that'll simply price us out of the international market.	0
ClaimBuster	3002	We tried to overturn it in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	3003	But not due to his policies.	0
ClaimBuster	3004	And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power.	0
ClaimBuster	3005	And I think first you should -- I should understand that the question on your mind is do I understand your problem.	0
ClaimBuster	3006	There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.	0
ClaimBuster	3007	These terrorists are serious, they're deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill.	0
ClaimBuster	3008	And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.	1
ClaimBuster	3009	The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor.	1
ClaimBuster	3010	I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	1
ClaimBuster	3011	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	1
ClaimBuster	3012	We try to help people with disabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	3013	And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?	0
ClaimBuster	3014	Well, it's been a privilege to be able to talk to the American people tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	3015	I think it's accurate to say that in uh - two years ago when Mr. Nixon - Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh - excused as were - as were the uh - the ones who evaded the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	3016	I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	3017	I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.	0
ClaimBuster	3018	And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	3019	He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.	0
ClaimBuster	3020	The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing.	1
ClaimBuster	3021	No child should be left behind in America.	0
ClaimBuster	3022	I think it's the tone.	0
ClaimBuster	3023	I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.	0
ClaimBuster	3024	The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history.	0
ClaimBuster	3025	And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.	0
ClaimBuster	3026	And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	3027	But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.	0
ClaimBuster	3028	This is not a Wall Street tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	3029	And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it.	0
ClaimBuster	3030	And let me tell you...	0
ClaimBuster	3031	I think we're ready to move.	0
ClaimBuster	3032	You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.	1
ClaimBuster	3033	I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.	0
ClaimBuster	3034	But more than that, they are role models.	0
ClaimBuster	3035	To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	3036	I think it is good.	0
ClaimBuster	3037	I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	3038	And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.	0
ClaimBuster	3039	We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	3040	Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	3041	They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring.	0
ClaimBuster	3042	But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.	0
ClaimBuster	3043	And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.	0
ClaimBuster	3044	And Colin Powell helped set up that summit.	1
ClaimBuster	3045	I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century.	0
ClaimBuster	3046	You get to defer your taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	3047	So I know what it's like to have to look welfare head-on.	0
ClaimBuster	3048	The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.	1
ClaimBuster	3049	Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again.	0
ClaimBuster	3050	And I favor the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	3051	We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.	1
ClaimBuster	3052	I have fought against special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	3053	And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked.	0
ClaimBuster	3054	I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.	0
ClaimBuster	3055	One is the Middle East, and that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations, because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there.	0
ClaimBuster	3056	Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing.	0
ClaimBuster	3057	She understands that better than almost any American that I know.	0
ClaimBuster	3058	I want the future of this country to be as bright and brilliant as its past, and it can be if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	3059	They're going to have to make the decision themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	3060	Our schools are now better.	0
ClaimBuster	3061	When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.	0
ClaimBuster	3062	"And I believe the answer to that has to also be ""yes.''"	0
ClaimBuster	3063	I know many of her donors.	0
ClaimBuster	3064	That just happened, and many more are coming.	1
ClaimBuster	3065	George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill.	1
ClaimBuster	3066	We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.	1
ClaimBuster	3067	But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we've made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	3068	Now we've got three of them.	1
ClaimBuster	3069	We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.	1
ClaimBuster	3070	And I appreciate that question.	0
ClaimBuster	3071	That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.	0
ClaimBuster	3072	We are a goldfish bowl before the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3073	And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.	1
ClaimBuster	3074	Most people want to see their own doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	3075	And under the plan that I've proposed, 80% of all family farms will be completely exempt from the estate tax.	1
ClaimBuster	3076	About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.	1
ClaimBuster	3077	Well, that's what a President's supposed to know -- where those weapons are going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	3078	You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price.	1
ClaimBuster	3079	And this means more than what we've been doing.	0
ClaimBuster	3080	He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	3081	Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	3082	And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.	1
ClaimBuster	3083	I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.	1
ClaimBuster	3084	If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.	0
ClaimBuster	3085	But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.	1
ClaimBuster	3086	It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.	0
ClaimBuster	3087	They didn't go over to coddle.	0
ClaimBuster	3088	The question which we have to decide as Americans - are we doing enough today?	0
ClaimBuster	3089	And did the person have full access to the courts of law?	0
ClaimBuster	3090	Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	3091	Will women's rights be protected?	0
ClaimBuster	3092	Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children.	0
ClaimBuster	3093	We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3094	This nation is the hope of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	3095	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	3096	Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.	0
ClaimBuster	3097	If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	3098	That's the way we leave it.	0
ClaimBuster	3099	Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach.	1
ClaimBuster	3100	Again, this is just a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	3101	Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology.	1
ClaimBuster	3102	We've done a long way working together to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	3103	And there was no demonstration involved.	1
ClaimBuster	3104	You get a catastrophic plan to help you on it.	0
ClaimBuster	3105	I know others disagree with it.	0
ClaimBuster	3106	Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?	0
ClaimBuster	3107	Look, that's where World War I started in the Balkans.	1
ClaimBuster	3108	It's going to be tough fighting.	0
ClaimBuster	3109	And I think they deserve a family and medical leave act.	0
ClaimBuster	3110	And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.	1
ClaimBuster	3111	That's not what we are going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3112	But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.	1
ClaimBuster	3113	Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck.	0
ClaimBuster	3114	But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.	1
ClaimBuster	3115	But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.	0
ClaimBuster	3116	Thank you very much to the university, again.	0
ClaimBuster	3117	I represented upstate New York.	1
ClaimBuster	3118	I came from very modest means.	1
ClaimBuster	3119	The Vice President ignored them.	1
ClaimBuster	3120	I've got a strategy for the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	3121	I'm also going to talk -- respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	3122	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	3123	Fifty times we deployed troops around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	3124	But we will defend the citizens of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3125	You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all.	1
ClaimBuster	3126	There is a lot of blame to go around.	0
ClaimBuster	3127	That's one of the main reasons that we've had such an increase in the number of people employed.	1
ClaimBuster	3128	The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.	0
ClaimBuster	3129	We owe you a debt we can never repay you.	0
ClaimBuster	3130	And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.	0
ClaimBuster	3131	Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.	1
ClaimBuster	3132	You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.	1
ClaimBuster	3133	You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.	0
ClaimBuster	3134	And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.	1
ClaimBuster	3135	Off-road diesel engines -- we have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3136	So we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers.	0
ClaimBuster	3137	First of all, when we and our allies -- the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government.	1
ClaimBuster	3138	I don't think we're a declining nation.	0
ClaimBuster	3139	I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases.	0
ClaimBuster	3140	And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign.	1
ClaimBuster	3141	The difference is we've got a new policy.	1
ClaimBuster	3142	I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	3143	I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are.	0
ClaimBuster	3144	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	1
ClaimBuster	3145	The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	3146	It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	3147	So I salute these things.	0
ClaimBuster	3148	We have the right approach for the future and looks at the results.	0
ClaimBuster	3149	We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.	1
ClaimBuster	3150	But I don't think we need these other systems.	0
ClaimBuster	3151	The people in Washington are good people.	0
ClaimBuster	3152	By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	3153	We have to stop them from leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	3154	Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up.	1
ClaimBuster	3155	I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.	0
ClaimBuster	3156	My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.	0
ClaimBuster	3157	But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	3158	I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.	0
ClaimBuster	3159	I've seen the tough times, I know they can be better and I'll lead America to a brighter future.	0
ClaimBuster	3160	I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.	0
ClaimBuster	3161	We need to reform it.	0
ClaimBuster	3162	He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.	1
ClaimBuster	3163	First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	3164	They're going backwards on the water quality.	1
ClaimBuster	3165	That's why I'd have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	3166	For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.	1
ClaimBuster	3167	I think we can say, through the Packard Commission Report and I'm very proud that David Packard, the originator of that report, is strongly supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	3168	I'm opposed to the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	3169	And I intend to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	3170	Nothing could be further from the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	3171	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	0
ClaimBuster	3172	The challenges that we face are unprecedented.	0
ClaimBuster	3173	But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.	0
ClaimBuster	3174	I voted for the balanced budget in '93 and '97.	1
ClaimBuster	3175	But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.	1
ClaimBuster	3176	And I'd be happy to discuss these other issues, but I can't believe he is accusing me of getting on both sides.	1
ClaimBuster	3177	He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.	1
ClaimBuster	3178	Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn't pick.	0
ClaimBuster	3179	With regard to Medicare, no, but it's time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	3180	I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America.	0
ClaimBuster	3181	My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	3182	And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	3183	And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.	1
ClaimBuster	3184	So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.	0
ClaimBuster	3185	But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred.	0
ClaimBuster	3186	But it isn't going to get the job done if we don't change K through 12.	0
ClaimBuster	3187	We didn't ask for it.	0
ClaimBuster	3188	"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did."""	0
ClaimBuster	3189	Secondly, if you were so opposed to the grain embargo, why did you ask the godfather of the grain embargo to be one of your top foreign policy advisers?	0
ClaimBuster	3190	John Edwards is the author of the Patients' Bill of Rights.	1
ClaimBuster	3191	And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.	0
ClaimBuster	3192	What was his participation there?	0
ClaimBuster	3193	We invested in a solar company, our country.	1
ClaimBuster	3194	As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.	0
ClaimBuster	3195	No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system.	0
ClaimBuster	3196	We're beginning to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3197	I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true.	0
ClaimBuster	3198	And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	3199	I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.	0
ClaimBuster	3200	And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.	1
ClaimBuster	3201	And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	3202	But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	3203	I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims.	1
ClaimBuster	3204	It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	3205	There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	3206	This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.	1
ClaimBuster	3207	Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections.	0
ClaimBuster	3208	I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.	0
ClaimBuster	3209	(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point?	0
ClaimBuster	3210	And we're the most religious people on Earth.	1
ClaimBuster	3211	Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.	1
ClaimBuster	3212	For 200 years, we've lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday.	1
ClaimBuster	3213	We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.	0
ClaimBuster	3214	She shouldn't be allowed to run.	0
ClaimBuster	3215	It's one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	3216	uh - The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	3217	He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	3218	Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.	0
ClaimBuster	3219	We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	3220	Hillary, you have no idea.	0
ClaimBuster	3221	I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge.	0
ClaimBuster	3222	There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.	1
ClaimBuster	3223	So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.	0
ClaimBuster	3224	One last point I want to make on energy.	0
ClaimBuster	3225	We can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	3226	I think we need to fully enforce the law.	0
ClaimBuster	3227	Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.	0
ClaimBuster	3228	Their currency has dropped 80 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3229	But Obamacare has to go.	0
ClaimBuster	3230	We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.	1
ClaimBuster	3231	Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.	1
ClaimBuster	3232	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.	1
ClaimBuster	3233	If it hadn't been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he'd have nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	3234	It's between a woman, God and her doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	3235	At the American Conference - Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn't even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	3236	That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	3237	But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.	0
ClaimBuster	3238	It's pretty clear that was a quota case, and just because one teacher was white and one black and they had the same qualifications, you know they decided who would stay there.	0
ClaimBuster	3239	We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home's worth over 500,000 dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	3240	If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested.	0
ClaimBuster	3241	You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.	0
ClaimBuster	3242	But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things.	0
ClaimBuster	3243	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	3244	If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.	0
ClaimBuster	3245	And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.	0
ClaimBuster	3246	How could we have not known?	0
ClaimBuster	3247	I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	3248	Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it.	0
ClaimBuster	3249	If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.	0
ClaimBuster	3250	The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	3251	Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	3252	It seems to me that you have a selective memory.	0
ClaimBuster	3253	And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.	1
ClaimBuster	3254	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	0
ClaimBuster	3255	And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place.	0
ClaimBuster	3256	Mr. Bush talked about values.	0
ClaimBuster	3257	Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.	1
ClaimBuster	3258	We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	3259	I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	3260	It's now 121/4, and I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly.	1
ClaimBuster	3261	Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.	0
ClaimBuster	3262	President Clinton came to California in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	3263	It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	3264	The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan.	0
ClaimBuster	3265	I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	3266	You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.	1
ClaimBuster	3267	I sold them my remaining shares.	1
ClaimBuster	3268	It's a lot of money to protect other people.	0
ClaimBuster	3269	We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.	1
ClaimBuster	3270	-- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.	0
ClaimBuster	3271	And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	3272	And there are a number of things.	0
ClaimBuster	3273	It was laughed at all over the world what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	3274	Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	3275	And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls.	1
ClaimBuster	3276	We took our eye off the ball.	0
ClaimBuster	3277	Now, if that's true, just tell me now.	0
ClaimBuster	3278	If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	3279	"I didn't hear the word ""liberal"" or ""left"" one time."	0
ClaimBuster	3280	And they have not got it done.	1
ClaimBuster	3281	I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	3282	I'm ready to go at it right now.	1
ClaimBuster	3283	Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	3284	"And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, ""I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,"" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't."	1
ClaimBuster	3285	But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.	0
ClaimBuster	3286	And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn't a popular move.	0
ClaimBuster	3287	I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first.	0
ClaimBuster	3288	Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.	0
ClaimBuster	3289	But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them.	0
ClaimBuster	3290	The plane wasn't flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money.	1
ClaimBuster	3291	No, you are the one that's unfit.	0
ClaimBuster	3292	Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.	0
ClaimBuster	3293	A lot of people, including me, said, look, it's not doing what it should do.	1
ClaimBuster	3294	But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.	0
ClaimBuster	3295	Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	3296	But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.	1
ClaimBuster	3297	But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.	0
ClaimBuster	3298	This is what a president has to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3299	I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.	0
ClaimBuster	3300	We didn't guard the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	3301	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	3302	And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear.	0
ClaimBuster	3303	So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.	1
ClaimBuster	3304	I feel very strongly the same place.	0
ClaimBuster	3305	There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	3306	But my economic program is the kind of change we want.	0
ClaimBuster	3307	And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	3308	There isn't any such thing as something free out there.	0
ClaimBuster	3309	May I disagree with the premise of your question?	0
ClaimBuster	3310	And so they're looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	3311	That's what America's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	3312	"I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """	1
ClaimBuster	3313	I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.	1
ClaimBuster	3314	And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.	0
ClaimBuster	3315	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	1
ClaimBuster	3316	And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	3317	Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival.	0
ClaimBuster	3318	By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.	1
ClaimBuster	3319	So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.	0
ClaimBuster	3320	And we've got a lot of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3321	And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.	0
ClaimBuster	3322	I can see how tough that terrain is.	0
ClaimBuster	3323	By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved.	0
ClaimBuster	3324	In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.	0
ClaimBuster	3325	Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.	1
ClaimBuster	3326	"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, ""Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs."	1
ClaimBuster	3327	I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	3328	Well I'm glad you asked.	0
ClaimBuster	3329	We've got a pilot program.	1
ClaimBuster	3330	About a thousand raised their hands.	1
ClaimBuster	3331	We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.	0
ClaimBuster	3332	You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces.	0
ClaimBuster	3333	I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile.	0
ClaimBuster	3334	She finally gave it up.	1
ClaimBuster	3335	And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.	0
ClaimBuster	3336	They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.	0
ClaimBuster	3337	I mean, you may be sending a signal.	0
ClaimBuster	3338	That's what she told me her husband understood.	1
ClaimBuster	3339	Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?	0
ClaimBuster	3340	And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.	0
ClaimBuster	3341	Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.	0
ClaimBuster	3342	Unfortunately, we didn't have more questions on that.	1
ClaimBuster	3343	What message does that send our troops?	0
ClaimBuster	3344	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	0
ClaimBuster	3345	We need to keep that in line.	0
ClaimBuster	3346	And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.	1
ClaimBuster	3347	I mean, you say we've done all these bad things, which isn't the case.	0
ClaimBuster	3348	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.	0
ClaimBuster	3349	That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	3350	We have not been updating from the new standpoint.	1
ClaimBuster	3351	We've doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it.	1
ClaimBuster	3352	But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	3353	September the 11th changed how America must look at the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3354	He has a one-point plan.	1
ClaimBuster	3355	I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused.	1
ClaimBuster	3356	And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	3357	We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in.	1
ClaimBuster	3358	Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way -- all the way through.	0
ClaimBuster	3359	It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and √É‚Äö Democratic Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	3360	When I was running -- when we had the debate in 2000, never dreamt I'd be doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	3361	I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	3362	Come on, that's not leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	3363	I'm not going to increase taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	3364	She's the 36th student in that classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	3365	This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.	0
ClaimBuster	3366	Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.	0
ClaimBuster	3367	I sure stopped their budget.	1
ClaimBuster	3368	It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.	1
ClaimBuster	3369	You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	3370	They inform on the bad guys.	0
ClaimBuster	3371	And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	3372	But he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more.	0
ClaimBuster	3373	None of them ever get implemented because -- let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	3374	We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you don't know how to do: We balanced the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	3375	And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	3376	This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	3377	I want a smaller and smarter government.	0
ClaimBuster	3378	I say it all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	3379	I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.	0
ClaimBuster	3380	In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.	0
ClaimBuster	3381	See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.	0
ClaimBuster	3382	This is a responsibility of the president.	0
ClaimBuster	3383	I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	3384	And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	3385	So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.	0
ClaimBuster	3386	I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again.	0
ClaimBuster	3387	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	0
ClaimBuster	3388	The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.	0
ClaimBuster	3389	He says don't do it, but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N.	1
ClaimBuster	3390	I believe that we need to export more so I'll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family.	0
ClaimBuster	3391	And I suspect, given his record, he's going to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	3392	Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.	0
ClaimBuster	3393	Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.	0
ClaimBuster	3394	Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	3395	Thank you, Carole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	3396	I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.	1
ClaimBuster	3397	When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one.	1
ClaimBuster	3398	I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	3399	Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	3400	I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.	1
ClaimBuster	3401	I believe America's best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	3402	But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.	1
ClaimBuster	3403	My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting.	0
ClaimBuster	3404	I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.	0
ClaimBuster	3405	Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.	0
ClaimBuster	3406	If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	3407	Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	3408	I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing.	1
ClaimBuster	3409	Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power.	1
ClaimBuster	3410	Well, I'm not for registration.	0
ClaimBuster	3411	You've got to free up the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	3412	Is that a new question or a 30-second question?	0
ClaimBuster	3413	Here are the key ingredients.	0
ClaimBuster	3414	And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.	0
ClaimBuster	3415	If we don't get the economy to grow, if we don't cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we're going to limp into the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	3416	Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote?	1
ClaimBuster	3417	What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.	0
ClaimBuster	3418	Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.	0
ClaimBuster	3419	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	0
ClaimBuster	3420	Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.	1
ClaimBuster	3421	In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.	1
ClaimBuster	3422	You're right, what does matter is a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	3423	Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright.	0
ClaimBuster	3424	So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	3425	I think the Communists have been moving with vigor - Laos, Africa, Cuba - all around the world today they're on the move.	0
ClaimBuster	3426	I have a plan to cover all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	3427	I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.	0
ClaimBuster	3428	So that's on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	3429	And it was terminated by current mayor.	1
ClaimBuster	3430	Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there.	1
ClaimBuster	3431	And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.	0
ClaimBuster	3432	What should I have done?	0
ClaimBuster	3433	China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are.	1
ClaimBuster	3434	Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.	0
ClaimBuster	3435	You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.	0
ClaimBuster	3436	Our troops have performed brilliantly.	0
ClaimBuster	3437	Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army.	1
ClaimBuster	3438	Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.	1
ClaimBuster	3439	We've created, and I'm not aiming at any one person here, I'm aiming at our government -- nobody takes responsibility for anything.	0
ClaimBuster	3440	We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.	1
ClaimBuster	3441	I want you to be on my team.	1
ClaimBuster	3442	I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay.	0
ClaimBuster	3443	One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	3444	It's not a grand diversion.	0
ClaimBuster	3445	Yes, I mean, he's got a record.	0
ClaimBuster	3446	We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing.	0
ClaimBuster	3447	If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up.	0
ClaimBuster	3448	Now, we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created.	1
ClaimBuster	3449	It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.	1
ClaimBuster	3450	Our allies feel that we've neglected them.	0
ClaimBuster	3451	We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.	0
ClaimBuster	3452	The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened.	1
ClaimBuster	3453	Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	3454	I think everybody's paying too much taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	3455	Well, I'm glad you raised that question.	0
ClaimBuster	3456	Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	3457	They currently favor going forward with a runoff election.	1
ClaimBuster	3458	We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	3459	Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again.	1
ClaimBuster	3460	Because you have nothing to say.	0
ClaimBuster	3461	Whether we're going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns.	0
ClaimBuster	3462	My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American.	1
ClaimBuster	3463	And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	3464	The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.	1
ClaimBuster	3465	He was a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	3466	And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	3467	It's not just movies; television, video games, music, the Internet.	0
ClaimBuster	3468	And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.	0
ClaimBuster	3469	I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself.	0
ClaimBuster	3470	A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.	1
ClaimBuster	3471	And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.	0
ClaimBuster	3472	We welcome legal immigrants into this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3473	I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times.	0
ClaimBuster	3474	And while I was there I worked on a bipartisan basis, as I did in the House, I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry.	1
ClaimBuster	3475	The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.	1
ClaimBuster	3476	And plus, we cut taxes for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	3477	With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.	1
ClaimBuster	3478	He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.	1
ClaimBuster	3479	He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	3480	Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.	1
ClaimBuster	3481	No, I'm not proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	3482	We've had uh - Republican presidents before who've tried to run against a Democratic - uh Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	3483	I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	3484	I think you know because you've covered these issues, that there's no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	3485	"I, I still remember a woman that I met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell, give an answer when they say, ""What does your mother do for a job?"""	1
ClaimBuster	3486	Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	3487	Now let me just tell you a little story.	0
ClaimBuster	3488	We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	3489	And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.	1
ClaimBuster	3490	You also have investments outside the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	3491	Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights.	0
ClaimBuster	3492	What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.	0
ClaimBuster	3493	I completely respect their views.	0
ClaimBuster	3494	To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	3495	So some may be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	3496	They feel we have to have strong borders.	0
ClaimBuster	3497	Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	3498	You raise taxes and you kill jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	3499	I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular.	0
ClaimBuster	3500	That's one major war explosion in a warhead.	0
ClaimBuster	3501	I'd like to thank the hundreds of executives who came to Chicago, a third of them Republicans, who said they wanted to change.	1
ClaimBuster	3502	Well, where are the papers?	0
ClaimBuster	3503	The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	3504	We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together.	0
ClaimBuster	3505	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	0
ClaimBuster	3506	I love the people here.	0
ClaimBuster	3507	And I don't have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments.	0
ClaimBuster	3508	But it's the right move not to join a foreign court that could -- where our people could be prosecuted.	0
ClaimBuster	3509	Let me come back and -- and answer your question.	0
ClaimBuster	3510	And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.	1
ClaimBuster	3511	I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you.	0
ClaimBuster	3512	Government does not create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	3513	In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	3514	You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.	1
ClaimBuster	3515	But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	3516	Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations - regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land.	1
ClaimBuster	3517	We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	3518	I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	3519	Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	3520	One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker.	0
ClaimBuster	3521	We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	3522	Doing everything we can to control our own energy.	0
ClaimBuster	3523	Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace.	0
ClaimBuster	3524	An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3525	And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	3526	Because we've got a lot of people advocating we don't want to put our money into Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	3527	And we got some very good Republican women running.	1
ClaimBuster	3528	And that's why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration.	1
ClaimBuster	3529	And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.	0
ClaimBuster	3530	We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state.	1
ClaimBuster	3531	And in those two cases, I would favor them.	0
ClaimBuster	3532	I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.	0
ClaimBuster	3533	The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality.	0
ClaimBuster	3534	And that means keeping our military strong.	0
ClaimBuster	3535	Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	3536	We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	3537	First of all, I'm going through from the very beginning -- we're going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military.	0
ClaimBuster	3538	And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.	0
ClaimBuster	3539	And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.	1
ClaimBuster	3540	(LAUGHTER) I am a person who keeps promises.	0
ClaimBuster	3541	I don't think we need 150,000 troops.	0
ClaimBuster	3542	Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.	0
ClaimBuster	3543	I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.	0
ClaimBuster	3544	There's no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	3545	Now look, if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man.	1
ClaimBuster	3546	Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.	0
ClaimBuster	3547	But these are important questions.	0
ClaimBuster	3548	I said they need -- these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy.	0
ClaimBuster	3549	I want to tell her, I'll fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors and fight for the people of this country for a prosperity that benefits all.	0
ClaimBuster	3550	Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?	0
ClaimBuster	3551	I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase.	0
ClaimBuster	3552	I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill.	1
ClaimBuster	3553	We've got to pay our troops more.	0
ClaimBuster	3554	We're going to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	3555	The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.	1
ClaimBuster	3556	This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	3557	I support the death penalty.	1
ClaimBuster	3558	They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	3559	I did a study on it; they're cost- ineffective.	1
ClaimBuster	3560	If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law.	0
ClaimBuster	3561	Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do.	1
ClaimBuster	3562	Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.	0
ClaimBuster	3563	So let's just, let's give credit where credit is due.	0
ClaimBuster	3564	Will our children be better off?	0
ClaimBuster	3565	I'm talking about a national mood.	0
ClaimBuster	3566	Once again, the president is misleading America.	0
ClaimBuster	3567	And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.	0
ClaimBuster	3568	First of all, as I say, I don't think that -- we're not going to have another Cold War with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	3569	Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.	0
ClaimBuster	3570	And I know that everybody uh - makes mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	3571	Now he did use uh - ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh - does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that's we so badly need as we enter into uh - negotiations uh - under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh - we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh - apologized, uh - would not have justified my asking for his resignation.	1
ClaimBuster	3572	In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.	0
ClaimBuster	3573	Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator.	0
ClaimBuster	3574	I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	3575	That's one of the problems with this administration's so-called shuttle diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	3576	I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California - and we were the first to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3577	And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.	1
ClaimBuster	3578	I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.	1
ClaimBuster	3579	But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.	1
ClaimBuster	3580	So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.	0
ClaimBuster	3581	That's not how you bring people together.	0
ClaimBuster	3582	That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.	1
ClaimBuster	3583	But let me tell you where the president's policies have put us.	0
ClaimBuster	3584	To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.	0
ClaimBuster	3585	But it's an honor that we have it.	0
ClaimBuster	3586	But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him.	0
ClaimBuster	3587	First of all, I do have mandatory testing.	0
ClaimBuster	3588	Because the question you ask is important.	0
ClaimBuster	3589	How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?	0
ClaimBuster	3590	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	1
ClaimBuster	3591	There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.	0
ClaimBuster	3592	The people have to make up their minds.	0
ClaimBuster	3593	Let me restate uh - our policy.	0
ClaimBuster	3594	It just takes - from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	3595	But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.	1
ClaimBuster	3596	And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination.	0
ClaimBuster	3597	So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.	0
ClaimBuster	3598	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3599	And we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it, and you just saw it in response to previous questions.	0
ClaimBuster	3600	I have seen what's happened in this last 4 years when -- in my state, when people lose their jobs there's a good chance I'll know them by their names.	0
ClaimBuster	3601	How -- why would these people stay there?	0
ClaimBuster	3602	For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	3603	We don't want our kids coming back here.	0
ClaimBuster	3604	Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.	0
ClaimBuster	3605	I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.	0
ClaimBuster	3606	So at least we have time to work with it.	0
ClaimBuster	3607	Over the next four years, we'll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America.	0
ClaimBuster	3608	You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.	1
ClaimBuster	3609	Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible.	0
ClaimBuster	3610	They have not been forthcoming.	0
ClaimBuster	3611	Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	3612	Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	3613	That's why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing.	0
ClaimBuster	3614	"I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, ""No controlling legal authority."""	0
ClaimBuster	3615	I will not privatize it.	0
ClaimBuster	3616	I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line.	0
ClaimBuster	3617	I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3618	We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.	0
ClaimBuster	3619	The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.	1
ClaimBuster	3620	Our inner cities are a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	3621	That's what a governor gets to do.	1
ClaimBuster	3622	She had a small business with 63 employees.	1
ClaimBuster	3623	When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	3624	We can't have any test of race.	0
ClaimBuster	3625	And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	3626	They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology.	0
ClaimBuster	3627	The fact-finding committee's powers are limited.	0
ClaimBuster	3628	He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.	1
ClaimBuster	3629	Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	3630	In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	3631	We are going to cut taxes massively.	0
ClaimBuster	3632	Oh, you mean the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	3633	I want to bring that change to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	3634	We've got a plan to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	3635	Thank you very much, Ann.	0
ClaimBuster	3636	The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws.	1
ClaimBuster	3637	The -- the greatest failure we've had with regards to -- to gun violence in some respects is what -- what is known as Fast and Furious.	1
ClaimBuster	3638	Was √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì what was the question?	0
ClaimBuster	3639	This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill.	0
ClaimBuster	3640	And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns.	0
ClaimBuster	3641	I'm going to shut that loophole, and I'm going to give the tax benefit to the companies that stay here in America to help make them more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	3642	What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	3643	And everything that I've tried to do, and everything that I'm now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.	0
ClaimBuster	3644	In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy.	0
ClaimBuster	3645	I think we've given the American people back their spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	3646	When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	3647	That's going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	3648	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	3649	"Somebody here asked the question about, ""Why haven't you vetoed something?"""	1
ClaimBuster	3650	Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.	1
ClaimBuster	3651	The president did not do what was necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	3652	And I would say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement.	0
ClaimBuster	3653	And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.	1
ClaimBuster	3654	I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.	0
ClaimBuster	3655	I'm trying to decipher that.	0
ClaimBuster	3656	So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.	0
ClaimBuster	3657	I apologize to my family.	0
ClaimBuster	3658	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	1
ClaimBuster	3659	We're going to do that with regulatory reform.	0
ClaimBuster	3660	One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.	1
ClaimBuster	3661	Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.	1
ClaimBuster	3662	He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	3663	With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didn't use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world's number one criminal and terrorist.	1
ClaimBuster	3664	The president mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	3665	So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.	1
ClaimBuster	3666	This will give them availability.	0
ClaimBuster	3667	The governor, if it's a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school.	1
ClaimBuster	3668	I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.	0
ClaimBuster	3669	And he drew up this manual.	1
ClaimBuster	3670	He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	3671	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	3672	This is obviously a very tender topic.	0
ClaimBuster	3673	He's great as a -- as a -- as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.	0
ClaimBuster	3674	We do and I hope...	0
ClaimBuster	3675	I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	3676	That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	3677	And, by the way, I like coal.	0
ClaimBuster	3678	We're doing better than a lot of the countries in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	3679	The reason I bring that up is because he's proposed $2.2 trillion in new spending, and he says he going to tax the rich to close the tax gap.	1
ClaimBuster	3680	Our country's in deep trouble.	0
ClaimBuster	3681	And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.	0
ClaimBuster	3682	We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	3683	Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don't quite square with the record.	0
ClaimBuster	3684	I did support it at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	3685	That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.	0
ClaimBuster	3686	So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	3687	And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.	0
ClaimBuster	3688	But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.	0
ClaimBuster	3689	(Laughter) Now, that's your tax money being wasted.	0
ClaimBuster	3690	And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.	1
ClaimBuster	3691	It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color.	0
ClaimBuster	3692	So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	3693	But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.	0
ClaimBuster	3694	Another thing is to deal with our - uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don't speak English, or who're black, or young people, or - 40 percent of the employment.	1
ClaimBuster	3695	I'm sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected.	0
ClaimBuster	3696	I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.	0
ClaimBuster	3697	I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	3698	That's why Senator Lugar says: incompetent in the delivery of services.	1
ClaimBuster	3699	Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	3700	And don't take my word for it.	0
ClaimBuster	3701	Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3702	And it's one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	3703	America remains the one indispensable nation.	0
ClaimBuster	3704	Government does not create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	3705	You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.	1
ClaimBuster	3706	And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.	0
ClaimBuster	3707	I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren't here then either.	0
ClaimBuster	3708	I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.	0
ClaimBuster	3709	And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.	0
ClaimBuster	3710	But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.	0
ClaimBuster	3711	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	3712	We had 7 billion this year and 10 billion more than the president.	1
ClaimBuster	3713	We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.	0
ClaimBuster	3714	And give us a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	3715	We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.	0
ClaimBuster	3716	The harder you work, the more you can keep.	0
ClaimBuster	3717	And we've been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices.	0
ClaimBuster	3718	I think it's the hard-working people of America's money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families.	0
ClaimBuster	3719	We knew he tortured his own people.	1
ClaimBuster	3720	It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America.	1
ClaimBuster	3721	But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income.	0
ClaimBuster	3722	And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	3723	What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important.	0
ClaimBuster	3724	And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	3725	Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	3726	And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.	0
ClaimBuster	3727	But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.	1
ClaimBuster	3728	The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	3729	So health care needs to be affordable and available.	0
ClaimBuster	3730	Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.	0
ClaimBuster	3731	Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear.	0
ClaimBuster	3732	Then, if the plans are huge and complex like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs.	0
ClaimBuster	3733	It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.	0
ClaimBuster	3734	And I've said mistakes were made.	0
ClaimBuster	3735	"""Oops, we haven't done the job."	0
ClaimBuster	3736	And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.	1
ClaimBuster	3737	It wasn't failing to serve.	0
ClaimBuster	3738	It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	3739	I don't have an indoor gymnasium and an indoor tennis and an indoor every other thing they can think of; I don't have a place where I can go make free TV to send to my constituents to try to brainwash them to elect me the next time.	1
ClaimBuster	3740	I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.	0
ClaimBuster	3741	That, I think, is a good balance.	0
ClaimBuster	3742	You don't turn national security into a political issue.	0
ClaimBuster	3743	I think that it basically has fallen.	0
ClaimBuster	3744	It had everything to do with energy.	0
ClaimBuster	3745	The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason.	1
ClaimBuster	3746	We're not allowed to vote on it.	1
ClaimBuster	3747	The trillion comes from the surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	3748	I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	3749	Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too.	1
ClaimBuster	3750	There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.	1
ClaimBuster	3751	We've got a plan in place.	1
ClaimBuster	3752	That I can tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	3753	And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.	0
ClaimBuster	3754	But it's gonna require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	3755	How did we do that?	0
ClaimBuster	3756	I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	3757	We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.	0
ClaimBuster	3758	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.	1
ClaimBuster	3759	Here's some thing that'll help.	0
ClaimBuster	3760	In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.	1
ClaimBuster	3761	That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.	0
ClaimBuster	3762	"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan."	0
ClaimBuster	3763	And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs.	0
ClaimBuster	3764	And we've got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries.	0
ClaimBuster	3765	I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3766	I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.	0
ClaimBuster	3767	Her husband PJ got killed.	1
ClaimBuster	3768	And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.	0
ClaimBuster	3769	And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.	0
ClaimBuster	3770	Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something.	0
ClaimBuster	3771	I think it's very important that we reform our entitlement programs.	0
ClaimBuster	3772	But I do not want to go the tax-and-spend route.	0
ClaimBuster	3773	That will not help us compete with China.	0
ClaimBuster	3774	In 1977, we took that away from the military.	1
ClaimBuster	3775	I appreciate their idealism, their sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	3776	And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.	0
ClaimBuster	3777	Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	3778	Now, like uh - any hardworking uh - person seeking public office uh - in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh - rather graphic language and I'm guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.	0
ClaimBuster	3779	I think you'll find somebody who might interest you.	0
ClaimBuster	3780	And we need to reform.	0
ClaimBuster	3781	We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it.	1
ClaimBuster	3782	And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.	1
ClaimBuster	3783	I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.	0
ClaimBuster	3784	I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3785	Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states.	1
ClaimBuster	3786	Oscar, the question of what the federal government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me.	1
ClaimBuster	3787	And that's the budget that we've put forward.	0
ClaimBuster	3788	I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.	0
ClaimBuster	3789	And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.	0
ClaimBuster	3790	Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:.	1
ClaimBuster	3791	It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.	1
ClaimBuster	3792	And look at her website.	0
ClaimBuster	3793	All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government.	1
ClaimBuster	3794	But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.	0
ClaimBuster	3795	And finally, I do believe in tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	3796	He said if affirmative action means quotas, he's against it.	1
ClaimBuster	3797	When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.	0
ClaimBuster	3798	I believe that we should defend Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	3799	But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure.	0
ClaimBuster	3800	John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	3801	And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	3802	There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.	1
ClaimBuster	3803	The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy.	0
ClaimBuster	3804	And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.	0
ClaimBuster	3805	We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.	0
ClaimBuster	3806	You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.	0
ClaimBuster	3807	Of course, the U.N. was invited in.	1
ClaimBuster	3808	And we have a very good fight.	0
ClaimBuster	3809	Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	3810	I would have put them in place earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	3811	I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	3812	So we're making progress but until we get that one done, we're not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem.	0
ClaimBuster	3813	I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	3814	First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing.	0
ClaimBuster	3815	I'd just like to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	3816	We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.	1
ClaimBuster	3817	Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.	0
ClaimBuster	3818	And I just want to make one thing very clear.	0
ClaimBuster	3819	We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	3820	"When he said, ""We're going to repeal Obamacare."	0
ClaimBuster	3821	Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.	0
ClaimBuster	3822	I got lots of relatives and they're good, average, middle-class, hardworking Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	3823	Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.	0
ClaimBuster	3824	The question is, was this wise?	0
ClaimBuster	3825	He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	3826	We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.	1
ClaimBuster	3827	President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well.	1
ClaimBuster	3828	It means -- and I have to, again, repeat this.	0
ClaimBuster	3829	He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.	1
ClaimBuster	3830	He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	3831	Democrats or Republicans, it will be preserved.	0
ClaimBuster	3832	The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.	0
ClaimBuster	3833	Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	3834	It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America.	0
ClaimBuster	3835	Why did she delete 33,000...	0
ClaimBuster	3836	We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	3837	I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.	0
ClaimBuster	3838	If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	3839	I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	3840	And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.	1
ClaimBuster	3841	And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	3842	When you announce that you're going to launch an attack into another country, it's pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us.	0
ClaimBuster	3843	On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.	0
ClaimBuster	3844	And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	3845	I've got a plan to control health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	3846	First of all, we didn't find out he didn't have weapons until we got there, and my opponent thought he had weapons and told everybody he thought he had weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	3847	We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.	0
ClaimBuster	3848	I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	3849	What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.	1
ClaimBuster	3850	I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.	0
ClaimBuster	3851	By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.	0
NewsClaims	3852	Scientists have determined the virus came about naturally, but there is some uncertainty about how it first infected people.	1
NewsClaims	3853	While a plurality of Americans (43%) say the new coronavirus most likely came about naturally, nearly three-in-ten (29%) say it most likely was created in a lab, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted from March 10 to 16, 2020, as part of the Center‚Äôs nearly yearlong Election News Pathways project.	1
NewsClaims	3854	Around a quarter of adults (23%) say it is most likely that the current strain of coronavirus was developed intentionally in a lab; another 6% say it was most likely made accidentally in a lab.	1
NewsClaims	3855	No, the new coronavirus didn't come from outer space.	1
NewsClaims	3856	One wild theory that has made its way around the web is that the virus came from space.	1
NewsClaims	3857	Spoiler alert: The virus did not come from space.	1
NewsClaims	3858	Recently, Chandra Wickramasinghe, known for his work in astronomy and astrobiology, spread the idea that the virus was living on a comet and a piece of that space rock may have fallen to Earth during a brief fireball event over China in October 2019.	1
NewsClaims	3859	"However, scientists have rebuked Wickramasinghe's suggestions that any such illness might have extraterrestrial origins, and his ideas have largely been considered pseudoscience or ""bad science."""	1
NewsClaims	3860	However, despite these theoretical possibilities, there is no credible evidence to show that the new coronavirus came from outer space, he added.	1
NewsClaims	3861	Epstein says that even if COVID-19 becomes a mere seasonal disease, knowing pets‚Äô role in viral spread will be useful.	1
NewsClaims	3862	"""CDC does not have evidence that pets can spread COVID-19, and there‚Äôs no reason to think pets might be a source of infection based on the information we have at this time,"" Casey Barton Behravesh, director of the agency‚Äôs One Health Office in the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, tells Science."	1
NewsClaims	3863	"""When you walk your dog, stay 6 feet away from other animals."	1

NewsClaims	4064	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	4065	In March 2020, the French government issued a decree that allowed doctors to temporarily use anti-epileptic drug Rivotril to alleviate pain for end-of-life patients in severe respiratory distress.	0
NewsClaims	4066	However, the decree did not authorize euthanasia or physician-assisted death.	0
NewsClaims	4067	There is no evidence that any patient in France was euthanized under these circumstances, and euthanasia is illegal in the country.	0
NewsClaims	4068	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	4069	First circulated on social media, this false claim was shared on April 7 on NewsGuard Red-rated anti-Islam website RiposteLaique.com.	0
NewsClaims	4070	A day later, it was promoted by French far-right website NS2017.wordpress.com.	0
NewsClaims	4071	On April 16, Red-rated French website BVoltaire.fr published an interview with a French medical doctor named Jo√´lle de Monredon claiming that the government‚Äôs move was ‚Äúeuthanasia and eugenics.‚Äù This interview was republished on April 18 by Contre-Info.com, a NewsGuard Red-rated website owned by a nonprofit connected with the Catholic nationalist organization Renouveau Fran√ßais.	0
NewsClaims	4072	MYTH: In Europe, ‚ÄúContact tracing apps were automatically installed on people‚Äôs smartphones without their consent‚Äù	0
NewsClaims	4073	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	4074	As countries started lifting lockdowns, Google and Apple developed a tool for governments to build their own contact-tracing apps to curb the spread of the virus.	0
NewsClaims	4075	In their latest updates, smartphones from the two brands included this exposure notification system.	0
NewsClaims	4076	Some countries, like Italy, used this feature to build their national app, but others, like France, chose not to.	0
NewsClaims	4077	In countries where governments decided to use it, citizens still had to download the app first, and to activate the feature before it did anything.	0
NewsClaims	4078	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	4079	In Italy, NewsGuard Red-rated site ByoBlu.com claimed on May 26 that the Google feature had been automatically installed and activated on people‚Äôs phones.	0
NewsClaims	4080	In France, the Red-rated website LumiereSurGaia.com, a hub of coronavirus hoaxes and false information about topics such as UFOs and the environment, published on May 29 an article claiming that the French government had secretly installed its app on people‚Äôs phones, and encouraged users to uninstall it.	0
NewsClaims	4081	(At that time, the French government app had not even been released).	0
NewsClaims	4082	The false claim was then reposted on May 31 by Red-rated site ReseauInternational.net and, on June 1, by WikiStrike.com.	0
NewsClaims	4083	These three websites are among the most popular misinformation sites in France.	0
NewsClaims	4084	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	4085	This variation on the false claim that the COVID-19 virus is manmade relies on misrepresenting a study published in the journal Nature Medicine in 2015.	0
NewsClaims	4086	The research found that bat coronaviruses were capable of directly infecting humans, but it did not involve the same strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4087	The study authors included researchers from UNC as well as the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.	0
NewsClaims	4088	A March 2020 editor‚Äôs note on the original study addressed the conspiracy theory.	0
NewsClaims	4089	‚ÄúWe are aware that this article is being used as the basis for unverified theories that the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 was engineered,‚Äù the note said.	0
NewsClaims	4090	‚ÄúThere is no evidence that this is true; scientists believe that an animal is the most likely source of the coronavirus.‚Äù	0
NewsClaims	4091	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	4092	The earliest mention of this false claim found by NewsGuard was a story from ShadOlsonShow.com in late February.	0
NewsClaims	4093	Radio host Olson reported on his site that he was ‚ÄúFirst to reveal the links to the ‚Äògain of function‚Äô coronavirus study by Dr. Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina.‚Äù The claim received further attention when it was spread in a series of March 3, 2020 tweets from an account using the name Greg Rubini, which has 129,000 followers.	0
NewsClaims	4094	According to a June 2020 article from BuzzFeed News, the Twitter account is run by an Italian man named Gregorio Palusa, a sound engineer and marketer.	0
NewsClaims	4095	Palusa has no proven expertise in national security or intelligence, but conservative cable news network One America News brought this myth further into the mainstream by citing his tweets under the Greg Rubini pseudonym in a March 14 report, describing him as ‚Äúa citizen investigator and monitored source amongst a certain set in the D.C. intelligence community,‚Äù according to liberal nonprofit Media Matters.	0

NewsClaims	4098	THE TRUTH:	0
NewsClaims	4099	There is no evidence that Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has personal financial investments in vaccines being developed for COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4100	Fauci‚Äôs agency is working with pharmaceutical company Moderna on a potential vaccine ‚Äî one of 141 that are currently in development, according to the World Health Organization ‚Äî but PolitiFact found no record of a business relationship between Fauci and Moderna in an April 2020 search of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs database.	0
NewsClaims	4101	HOW THE HOAX EMERGED:	0
NewsClaims	4102	PolitiFact reported that the false accusation against Fauci was made in an April 12, 2020 post on an anti-vaccine Facebook page called I Am Awake, which has 13,000 likes on the platform.	0
NewsClaims	4103	A similar claim was made by anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., on an April 20 podcast hosted on TruePundit.com, a NewsGuard Red-rated website that ranks among the top 850 U.S. news sites as measured by engagement.	0
NewsClaims	4104	Correction: An earlier version of this page incorrectly credited a 2019 study to researchers at Rice University and MIT.	0
NewsClaims	4105	While the lead author of the study, Kevin McHugh, worked at Rice University when the study was published, he conducted the research during his time at MIT.	0

NewsClaims	4108	Self-medication is not recommended for any disease.	0
NewsClaims	4109	With the spread of Covid-19however, it has gained many followers and can cause quite dangerous side effects.	0
NewsClaims	4110	One of them is medicated hepatitis, which, in extreme cases, requires liver transplantation.	0
NewsClaims	4111	According to hepatologist Paulo Bittencourt, president of the Brazilian Liver Institute of the Brazilian Society of Hepatology, 27% of acute or fulminant acute hepatitis are medicated.	0
NewsClaims	4112	This harm may be being caused in Brazilians by the indiscriminate use of vermifuge ivermectin.	0
NewsClaims	4113	Pulmonologist Frederico Fernandes, president of the S√£o Paulo Society of Pulmonology and Tisiology (SPPT), said on Twitter that he evaluated a young patient who is about to need a transplant.	0
NewsClaims	4114	According to Fernandes, she had a mild picture of Covid-19 and self-medicated with 18mg of ivermectin daily for a week.	0
NewsClaims	4115	The result?	0
NewsClaims	4116	An overload on the liver.	0
NewsClaims	4117	"""It is very sad to see a young person to the point of needing a transplant for using a medication that does not work in a situation that does not need any medication,"" he said in the publication."	0

NewsClaims	4127	Ivermectin is safe to eliminate parasites from the body, provided it is taken under medical supervision.	0
NewsClaims	4128	Mauro Schechter, an infectious disease specialist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), points out that the consequences of long-term use of ivermectin are not known.	0
NewsClaims	4129	"""The drug is only safe for the indications that are labeled,"" he warns."	0
NewsClaims	4130	According to him, 3% of patients have side effects associated with the central nervous system.	0
NewsClaims	4131	In addition, ivermectin causes malformation of fetuses in different animals, cannot be used by pregnant women and, at higher doses, is lethal to mice and causes seizures in dogs.	0
NewsClaims	4132	Paulo Bittencourt warns that the three medications in the covid kit (ivermectin, chloroquine and azithromycin) can lead to acute hepatitis.	0
NewsClaims	4133	Although the occurrence is rare, what worries is the large-scale, over-the-counter use to treat a disease that already affects millions of people.	0
NewsClaims	4134	"""The complication can be more frequent with exacerbated use"", he evaluates."	0
NewsClaims	4135	Bittencourt himself had a patient who used ivermectin every 15 days, at his own discretion, to avoid Covid-19.	0
NewsClaims	4136	He developed nausea after adopting the drug.	0
NewsClaims	4137	"""People say, 'If you don't do it well, you won't do it badly', but that's not at all real."""	0
NewsClaims	4138	The situation was so out of control that MSD, the pharmacist responsible for making ivermectin, issued a statement about the drug.	0

NewsClaims	4154	As I read, it works by putting your body on high alert, so you have a head start on any infection.	0
NewsClaims	4155	This is stated again here:https://www.hindawi.com/journals/iji/2013/151028/#conclusions-and-therapeutic-perspective	0
NewsClaims	4156	Given the results of 6 clinical trials in flu and the common cold, seen in the context of the serious criticism on the efficacy and safety of oseltamivir and zanamivir, PEA should be reconsidered by clinicians as a new treatment modality for the flu and respiratory infections due to its documented efficacy and more importantly its very benign side effect profile.	0
NewsClaims	4157	Furthermore, oseltamivir and zanamivir are known to induce resistance; PEA has a very low likelihood of inducing resistance due to its mechanism of action.	0
NewsClaims	4158	Finally, the ease of application of PEA offers the possibility to have a quick therapeutic answer ready in case of a flu epidemic, especially in cases of a mismatch between circulating strains and the recommendations from WHO.	0
NewsClaims	4159	So first off, PEA is not colloidal silver.	0
NewsClaims	4160	Two different things, two different chemicals and two different effects.	0
NewsClaims	4161	Specifically regarding colloidal silver, it does have antiviral properties.	0
NewsClaims	4162	That doesn‚Äôt meant it works well in humans.	0
NewsClaims	4163	All the studies you linked were in vitro, or in a Petri dish.	0
NewsClaims	4164	None in actual humans.	0
NewsClaims	4165	As is it irresponsible to warn people away from it on the premise that in vitro results cannot be expected for in vivo use.	0
NewsClaims	4166	It is common for in vitro and in vivo effects to be similar and there has been no established proof of damage from orally dosed silver nanoparticles in humans (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3877176/ ).	0
NewsClaims	4167	You are proposing threats without any evidence, against actual evidence to the contrary supporting it‚Äôs effectiveness combined with a long history of use.	0
NewsClaims	4168	To quote the NIH:	0
NewsClaims	4169	Colloidal silver can cause serious side effects.	0
NewsClaims	4170	The most common is argyria, a bluish-gray discoloration of the skin, which is usually permanent.	0
NewsClaims	4171	Do you have any evidence of it‚Äôs effectiveness in vivo?	0
NewsClaims	4172	While some studies may find that in vivo and in vitro effects are similiar, that can‚Äôt be a one-size-fits all, especially with Medical advice.	0
NewsClaims	4173	Colloidal silver is not FDA approved and unless there are in depth clinical trials studying it‚Äôs effectiveness and safety, it shouldn‚Äôt be taken either.	0
NewsClaims	4174	But don‚Äôt be fooled.	0
NewsClaims	4175	The bat connection	0
NewsClaims	4176	It appears that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is currently under suspicion because its scientists were studying bat coronaviruses in order to evaluate the possibility of the emergence of just such a pandemic as is currently underway.	0
NewsClaims	4177	'‚Äù	0
NewsClaims	4178	That the virus has natural origins is also apparent from its molecular structure.	0
NewsClaims	4179	As Josie Golding, epidemics lead at the UK-based Wellcome Trust, pointed out: The findings ‚Äúare crucially important to bring an evidence-based view to the rumors that have been circulating about the origins of the virus.‚Äù	0
NewsClaims	4180	Letting Trump off the hook?	0
NewsClaims	4181	Would that it were so simple.	0
NewsClaims	4182	All the news reports thus far rely on anonymous sources within the Trump Administration and the intelligence community ‚Äî and the former have a strong interest in hyping Chinese responsibility in order to divert the spotlight from Trump‚Äôs own chaotic, slow and ill-informed response to the pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	4183	A New York Times investigation published on April 11 looked in particular at the role of Matthew Pottinger, a former Wall Street Journal correspondent who is a noted China hawk and now deputy national security adviser in the Trump Administration.	0
NewsClaims	4184	The Times report also reveals that ‚ÄúMr.	0
NewsClaims	4185	Pottinger and others ‚Äî including aides to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ‚Äî pressed for government statements to use the term ‚ÄòWuhan Virus‚Äô‚Äù in order to help seal the impression of direct Chinese responsibility.	0
NewsClaims	4186	The spat has continued with Trump‚Äôs latest move to defund the World Health Organization, ostensibly because it has been too sympathetic to the Chinese leadership, but again, more likely in reality aimed to deflect attention from his own missteps.	0
NewsClaims	4187	The Wuhan ‚Äòwet market‚Äô	0
NewsClaims	4188	Indeed the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market had reportedly sold chickens, pheasants, bats, hedgehogs, marmots, tiger frogs and snakes, as well as organs from rabbits and other animals, at some point over the previous months.	0
NewsClaims	4189	Wildlife markets in China, as elsewhere in Asia, are notorious for keeping endangered and wild animals in close-confined unsanitary conditions that provide an ideal breeding grounds for germs and an easy route for viruses circulating in wild animals to infect humans via urine, feces or blood as they are butchered.	0
NewsClaims	4190	This was also the case for previous coronavirus epidemics: the earlier SARS and MERS epidemics, respectively, had civet cats and camels as intermediate hosts.	0
NewsClaims	4191	This has led to calls from over a hundred conservation charities to close wildlife markets and stop bushmeat consumption throughout the world, and to do so permanently ‚Äî both to protect animals from hunting, poaching and other exploitation and to reduce the potential for the next pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	4192	After all, it is not only coronaviruses that have zoonotic origins.	0
NewsClaims	4193	Ebola is likely to have infected humans from gorillas butchered in the forests of central Africa, while HIV is thought to have crossed into humans from chimpanzees, again probably when they were slaughtered for meat.	0
NewsClaims	4194	Protecting endangered wildlife could therefore not only support biodiversity goals, but help humanity avoid the next global pandemic.	0
NewsClaims	4195	With tens of thousands already dead and trillions of dollars wiped off the global economy thanks to COVID-19, the impacts of pandemics are surely too disastrous to allow conspiracy theories to derail a proper evidence-based global response.	0

NewsClaims	4243	As noted above, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an efficient solution different from those previously predicted7,11.	0
NewsClaims	4244	Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used19.	0
NewsClaims	4245	However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone20.	0
NewsClaims	4246	Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer; and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.	0
NewsClaims	4247	We also discuss whether selection during passage could have given rise to SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	4248	1.	0
NewsClaims	4249	Natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer	0
NewsClaims	4250	As many early cases of COVID-19 were linked to the Huanan market in Wuhan1,2, it is possible that an animal source was present at this location.	0
NewsClaims	4251	Although RaTG13, sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis bat1, is ~96% identical overall to SARS-CoV-2, its spike diverges in the RBD, which suggests that it may not bind efficiently to human ACE27 (Fig.	0
NewsClaims	4252	1a).	0
NewsClaims	4253	Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-221.	0
NewsClaims	4254	Although the RaTG13 bat virus remains the closest to SARS-CoV-2 across the genome1, some pangolin coronaviruses exhibit strong similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, including all six key RBD residues21 (Fig.	0
NewsClaims	4255	1).	0
NewsClaims	4256	This clearly shows that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein optimized for binding to human-like ACE2 is the result of natural selection.	0
NewsClaims	4257	Neither the bat betacoronaviruses nor the pangolin betacoronaviruses sampled thus far have polybasic cleavage sites.	0
NewsClaims	4258	Although no animal coronavirus has been identified that is sufficiently similar to have served as the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV-2, the diversity of coronaviruses in bats and other species is massively undersampled.	0
NewsClaims	4259	Mutations, insertions and deletions can occur near the S1‚ÄìS2 junction of coronaviruses22, which shows that the polybasic cleavage site can arise by a natural evolutionary process.	0
NewsClaims	4260	For a precursor virus to acquire both the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for binding to human ACE2, an animal host would probably have to have a high population density (to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently) and an ACE2-encoding gene that is similar to the human ortholog.	0
NewsClaims	4261	2.	0
NewsClaims	4262	Natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer	0
NewsClaims	4263	It is possible that a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 jumped into humans, acquiring the genomic features described above through adaptation during undetected human-to-human transmission.	0
NewsClaims	4264	Once acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it1,2.	0
NewsClaims	4265	All SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced so far have the genomic features described above and are thus derived from a common ancestor that had them too.	0
NewsClaims	4266	The presence in pangolins of an RBD very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 means that we can infer this was also probably in the virus that jumped to humans.	0
NewsClaims	4267	This leaves the insertion of polybasic cleavage site to occur during human-to-human transmission.	0
NewsClaims	4268	Estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 made with current sequence data point to emergence of the virus in late November 2019 to early December 201923, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases24.	0
NewsClaims	4269	Hence, this scenario presumes a period of unrecognized transmission in humans between the initial zoonotic event and the acquisition of the polybasic cleavage site.	0
NewsClaims	4270	Sufficient opportunity could have arisen if there had been many prior zoonotic events that produced short chains of human-to-human transmission over an extended period.	0
NewsClaims	4271	This is essentially the situation for MERS-CoV, for which all human cases are the result of repeated jumps of the virus from dromedary camels, producing single infections or short transmission chains that eventually resolve, with no adaptation to sustained transmission25.	0
NewsClaims	4272	Studies of banked human samples could provide information on whether such cryptic spread has occurred.	0
NewsClaims	4273	Retrospective serological studies could also be informative, and a few such studies have been conducted showing low-level exposures to SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses in certain areas of China26.	0
NewsClaims	4274	Critically, however, these studies could not have distinguished whether exposures were due to prior infections with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or other SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses.	0

NewsClaims	4278	Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models has been ongoing for many years in biosafety level 2 laboratories across the world27, and there are documented instances of laboratory escapes of SARS-CoV28.	0
NewsClaims	4279	We must therefore examine the possibility of an inadvertent laboratory release of SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	4280	In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired RBD mutations (Fig.	0
NewsClaims	4281	1a) during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been observed in studies of SARS-CoV11.	0
NewsClaims	4282	The finding of SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses from pangolins with nearly identical RBDs, however, provides a much stronger and more parsimonious explanation of how SARS-CoV-2 acquired these via recombination or mutation19.	0
NewsClaims	4283	The acquisition of both the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans also argues against culture-based scenarios.	0
NewsClaims	4284	New polybasic cleavage sites have been observed only after prolonged passage of low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus in vitro or in vivo17.	0
NewsClaims	4285	Furthermore, a hypothetical generation of SARS-CoV-2 by cell culture or animal passage would have required prior isolation of a progenitor virus with very high genetic similarity, which has not been described.	0
NewsClaims	4286	Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site would have then required repeated passage in cell culture or animals with ACE2 receptors similar to those of humans, but such work has also not previously been described.	0
NewsClaims	4287	Finally, the generation of the predicted O-linked glycans is also unlikely to have occurred due to cell-culture passage, as such features suggest the involvement of an immune system18.	0
NewsClaims	4288	A rapid review of evidence for claims that the so-called sunshine vitamin could reduce the risk of coronavirus was launched amid concerns about the disproportionate number of black, Asian and minority ethnic people contracting and dying from the disease.	0
NewsClaims	4289	Higher levels of melanin in the skin lead to less absorption of vitamin D from sunlight.	0
NewsClaims	4290	"""While there are health benefits associated with vitamin D, our rapid evidence summary did not identify sufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin D supplements for the treatment or prevention of Covid-19,"" said Paul Chrisp, the director of the centre for guidelines at Nice."	0
NewsClaims	4291	"""We know that the research on this subject is ongoing, and Nice is continuing to monitor new published evidence."""	0
NewsClaims	4292	At the same time, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) reached similar conclusions, stating that the evidence did not support recommending vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections.	0
NewsClaims	4293	However, both Nice and the SACN advised that people should continue to follow official guidance, which was updated in April, advising people to consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day to maintain bone and muscle health, amid concerns people were not getting enough sunlight during lockdown.	0
NewsClaims	4294	Prior to April, the advice was for people with little exposure to sunlight and/or with dark skin to take 10 micrograms all year round and for others to consider doing so in autumn and winter.	0
NewsClaims	4295	Nice said the five studies it had examined all had very low quality of evidence, noting that none had adjusted for confounding factors, such as body mass index, higher socioeconomic deprivation and poorer self-reported health.	0
NewsClaims	4296	The SACN said that one of the most widely supported studies to support the hypothesis that vitamin D reduces the risk of acute respiratory tract infections was one led by Prof Adrian Martineau in 2017.	0
NewsClaims	4297	"But Martineau, a professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, has himself described the evidence on vitamin D as ""mixed"" and the SACN said randomised controlled trials published since 2017 had not supported its conclusions."	0
NewsClaims	4298	"The committee said it would keep the topic ""under urgent review"" and consider updating its assessment if new evidence emerged from randomised controlled trials."	0

NewsClaims	4326	Growing concerns about the potential for cytokine storm syndrome in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients has raised questions about the safety of elderberry.	0
NewsClaims	4327	Cytokine storm syndrome ‚Äì a severe overproduction of immune cells that can lead to life-threatening lung inflammation ‚Äì may be a complication of COVID-19 in some patients.	0
NewsClaims	4328	This has raised questions about the safety of elderberry, since elderberry may have a pro-cytokine effect.	0
NewsClaims	4329	A very small study that used blood from healthy donors shows that elderberry extract increases the production of inflammatory cytokines in vitro.	0
NewsClaims	4330	But not all research agrees.	0
NewsClaims	4331	Other research suggests that elderberry might actually have an anti-cytokine effect.	0
NewsClaims	4332	Furthermore, there is NO evidence that elderberry induces cytokine storm syndrome in humans.	0

NewsClaims	4409	On Thursday, a WHO panel released new guidelines in the medical journal, The BMJ on treatments that have been used on COVID-19 patients.	0
NewsClaims	4410	"The organization cautioned against using remdesivir ""in hospitalized patients, regardless of disease severity, as there is currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients."""	0
NewsClaims	4411	The new guideline came from analyzing data from four randomized international trials with 7,000 patients hospitalized for COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4412	"The trials showed the drug had ""no meaningful effect on mortality or on other important outcomes for patients, such as the need for mechanical ventilation or time to clinical improvement,"" according to the WHO."	0
NewsClaims	4413	The panel also said the high-cost and difficulty of administering the drug (intravenously) were also factors in its recommendation.	0

NewsClaims	4452	The reasons have to do with how fragile the virus is.	0
NewsClaims	4453	But, to be extra careful, there are measures you can take that can reduce the risk even further.	0
NewsClaims	4454	Chinese officials have been screening some frozen food packaging for signs of the virus following their scare with the since-exonerated frozen Norwegian salmon in June.	0
NewsClaims	4455	Recently, they found some of the virus‚Äôs genetic material on a package of chicken wings from Brazil and frozen seafood from Ecuador and elsewhere.	0
NewsClaims	4456	Follow-up tests on people who may have been exposed to the chicken wings came back negative, according to officials.	0
NewsClaims	4457	"Viruses are ""obligate intracellular parasites,"" said Rodney Rohde, PhD, an associate dean for research at Texas State University‚Äôs College of Health Professions who focuses on public health microbiology."	0
NewsClaims	4458	That means they can‚Äôt reproduce outside the cells of a host, such as a human.	0
NewsClaims	4459	On packaging, they‚Äôre just sitting around waiting to die.	0
NewsClaims	4460	"""Unlike bacteria, viruses may remain viable on a surface for hours or days, but they can‚Äôt reproduce and thus will eventually die or become nonviable to transmit any infection."	0

NewsClaims	4462	He explained that outside, they‚Äôre vulnerable to drying out due to UV light from sunshine as well as temperature shifts, such as repeated thawing and refreezing.	0

NewsClaims	4472	There are many myths about COVID-19 that have been circulating through social media ‚Äî here are some of the most common ones, from the World Health Organization.	0
NewsClaims	4473	Truth: Protective measures, like proper handwashing and social distancing, need to be taken no matter where you live.	0
NewsClaims	4474	COVID-19 can be transmitted anywhere, regardless of how hot or humid the air is.	0
NewsClaims	4475	Just like the cold weather and hot and humid climate myths, this is not true.	0
NewsClaims	4476	Your body temperature stays relatively stable even when you take an extremely hot bath.	0
NewsClaims	4477	This just leaves you with a risk of a burn.	0
NewsClaims	4478	Still, the best way to prevent getting COVID-19 is to wash your hands often.	0
NewsClaims	4479	This prevents viruses on your hands from infecting you when you touch your face.	0
NewsClaims	4480	Truth: As temperatures continue to warm as we dive into spring, mosquitoes will become more common again in Western Massachusetts.	0
NewsClaims	4481	That typically brings a risk of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile Virus, but the increasing population of mosquitoes does not create another channel in which you can get COVID-19.	0
NewsClaims	4482	This is why social distancing and frequent hand washing is so important.	0
NewsClaims	4483	However, in combination with washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, this method is very effective.	0
NewsClaims	4484	You can also dry your hands after using paper towels, or instead use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.	0

NewsClaims	4504	Mink on the lam and corona‚Äôs reverse spillover	0
NewsClaims	4505	The first sign of trouble was that the mink stopped eating, said Hugh Hildebrandt, one of two main mink vets in Wisconsin.	0
NewsClaims	4506	Next came coughing and sneezing, lethargy and labored breathing.	0
NewsClaims	4507	Hildebrandt had worked with mink for 30 years.	0
NewsClaims	4508	He wrote the Merck Veterinary Manual section on mink.	0
NewsClaims	4509	But he had never seen anything like this.	0
NewsClaims	4510	Captive mink have a flu season in the fall, just like people‚Äîthey get it from us, in fact.	0
NewsClaims	4511	But what appeared in the two mink farms in Taylor, Wisconsin, that saw outbreaks in October was not flu, which tends to sicken the weakest animals.	0
NewsClaims	4512	This took out the strongest mink, the mature adult females.	0
NewsClaims	4513	Over a few days, it killed hundreds per day and about 5,500 total on the two ranches.	0
NewsClaims	4514	It whipped through by coat color, light to dark: The lighter-coat mink, ranch-bred to bring out recessive genes, have long been more delicate.	0
NewsClaims	4515	Five to seven days into the outbreak, the ranchers thought that most of the mink were going to die, said Hildebrandt.	0
NewsClaims	4516	"""And they wake up the next morning, and it's just stopped."	0
NewsClaims	4517	They all start eating.	0
NewsClaims	4518	"They eat more than they ever did before."""	0
NewsClaims	4519	The mink detectives	0
NewsClaims	4520	It wasn‚Äôt hard to guess the cause.	0
NewsClaims	4521	Wisconsin was a hotspot of the pandemic from late summer on, and workers at mink ranches had already tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	4522	But the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Madison confirmed the suspicion within days.	0
NewsClaims	4523	The first infections of US farmed mink, in Utah in August, had triggered a national investigation involving wildlife and human health experts across local, state, and federal agencies.	0
NewsClaims	4524	Their questions: How did the virus get there, where would it go next, and what could it do?	0
NewsClaims	4525	Soon after that, a second mink‚Äîan Oregon farm escapee‚Äîtested positive too.	0
NewsClaims	4526	Global industry meets global pandemic	0
NewsClaims	4527	Of all the animals that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (mostly dogs and cats, plus a few other mammals), the only species to have suffered large-scale casualties so far is the American mink,	0
NewsClaims	4528	Neovison vison,	0
NewsClaims	4529	living on mink ranches around the world.	0
NewsClaims	4530	Since the first mink got sick on a Dutch mink ranch in April, millions of the animals have died or been preemptively culled on nearly 400 ranches across Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Lithuania, Greece, Italy, France, Spain, and Canada.	0
NewsClaims	4531	The US has seen 16 ranch outbreaks since August: 12 in Utah, two in Wisconsin, one each in Oregon and Michigan.	0
NewsClaims	4532	"""It‚Äôs a top priority in human and veterinary diagnostic labs,"" Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin veterinary lab, said."	0
NewsClaims	4533	One of about a dozen such labs nationwide, the WVDL has been running COVID tests on farmed mink and people, in addition to its usual tests on cows, chickens, and other animals, and is now operating from 5 A.M. to 2 A.M.	0
NewsClaims	4534	Outbreaks on European mink ranches demonstrated the risks.	0
NewsClaims	4535	If the virus managed to establish a reservoir of disease in farmed mink or their wild cousins, it could hamper our fight against the pandemic, harm wildlife, or even threaten ecosystems.	0
NewsClaims	4536	Particularly if it mutated along the way into something deadlier, more transmissible, or harder for modern medicine to attack.	0
NewsClaims	4537	No man is an island, and neither are diseases	0
NewsClaims	4538	Zoonotic outbreaks happen constantly, and disease reservoirs are everywhere.	0
NewsClaims	4539	In one recent week,	0
NewsClaims	4540	ProMed,	0
NewsClaims	4541	the bulletin of the Massachusetts-based International Society for Infectious Diseases, emailed reports of avian influenza in Chinese people and Polish poultry, influenza in an Oregon horse, anthrax in Croatian cattle, and Australian bat lyssavirus in Queensland.	0
NewsClaims	4542	Raccoons harbor rabies; rodents across the American West harbor the bacterium that causes plague.	0
NewsClaims	4543	Diseases can jump the other way too.	0
NewsClaims	4544	People are a reservoir of tuberculosis for cattle.	0
NewsClaims	4545	Whenever a virus jumps to a new host species, it adapts by mutating.	0
NewsClaims	4546	That has come to pass recently: a new, apparently super-contagious variant first discovered in Britain has since been found in dozens of countries.	0
NewsClaims	4547	No evidence has emerged yet that farmed mink have infected people in the US, though that investigation is still ongoing.	0
NewsClaims	4548	But Denmark‚Äôs outbreaks showed the potential.	0
NewsClaims	4549	Hundreds of farms were affected‚ÄîDenmark, the world‚Äôs biggest mink producer, had 17 million animals.	0
NewsClaims	4550	A genetic variant dubbed Cluster-5 looked extra nasty, because the virus‚Äôs spike proteins had changed in a way that made it more difficult for the monoclonal antibodies used to treat some COVID patients (President Donald Trump was given monoclonal antibodies when he got sick) to recognize the virus, at least in the lab.	0
NewsClaims	4551	But it wasn‚Äôt those few human cases that prompted the Danish and Dutch governments to order culls of their mink.	0
NewsClaims	4552	Instead, as Danish virologist Marion Koopmans wrote in a November letter to	0
NewsClaims	4553	The Lancet	0
NewsClaims	4554	,	0
NewsClaims	4555	it was the risk of establishing a new reservoir for the disease, she wrote, and the unknown consequences.	0
NewsClaims	4556	By mid-November, a lucky break emerged from the Danes‚Äô surveillance: Cluster-5 sequences had stopped turning up in human cases and had, they guessed, dead-ended.	0
NewsClaims	4557	It was noteworthy enough that Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), weighed in.	0
NewsClaims	4558	It didn‚Äôt look like Cluster-5 had spread far enough to reduce vaccine efficacy, he said, though it was important to keep an eye on it.	0
NewsClaims	4559	Cluster-5 turned out not as bad a variant as feared, but the next one could be worse.	0
NewsClaims	4560	The mysteries of mutation	0
NewsClaims	4561	When it comes to deciding how much to freak out about a zoonotic virus, the details‚Äîlike what hosts they prefer, how long they stick around, or how fast they can mutate‚Äîmake all the difference.	0
NewsClaims	4562	"""Some viruses hardly ever change, but a host can remain infected for decades."	0
NewsClaims	4563	"Others mutate at a furious rate and change to outpace our immune response,"" wrote Hon Ip, a virologist at the National Wildlife Health Center, a lab that has been testing wild animals trapped near mink farms."	0
NewsClaims	4564	In the spring of 2020, scientists at both the National Wildlife Health Center and the veterinary lab hurried to create validated genetic tests for SARS-CoV-2.	0
NewsClaims	4565	Ferrets, which are closely related to mink, are used as animal models in human respiratory health studies.	0
NewsClaims	4566	"""We have a pretty extensive infrastructure to be able to do this very, very quickly,"" said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin veterinary lab."	0
NewsClaims	4567	"""We‚Äôd been at this super-high alert level."	0
NewsClaims	4568	"And they (mink farmers) were seeing thousands die per day."""	0
NewsClaims	4569	They knew, too, that Wisconsin had a heck of a lot of mink.	0
NewsClaims	4570	Last year its farmers produced a million pelts, one-third of the US total and the most of any state.	0
NewsClaims	4571	In the past few years, Taylor County, Wisconsin, produced the most mink pelts in North America, according to Hildebrandt.	0
NewsClaims	4572	CDC teams began collecting samples from the people and the mink on affected farms, while US Wildlife Services live-trapped wild animals nearby.	0
NewsClaims	4573	"Farms that went under quarantine would not be released until all their tests were negative, ""and we‚Äôre sure we‚Äôre not making a wildlife reservoir,"" Poulsen said."	0
NewsClaims	4574	Tracking who gave what to whom will take some time.	0
NewsClaims	4575	(That effort is being led by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.)	0
NewsClaims	4576	Comparing genomic sequences is a tricky chicken-and-egg problem, but some initial results have emerged.	0
NewsClaims	4577	"""Some of them are very, very clear,"" Poulsen said."	0
NewsClaims	4578	"""People became sick from community-acquired infection, and they gave it to the mink."	0
NewsClaims	4579	"But that‚Äôs not all the cases."""	0
NewsClaims	4580	The Mink Princesses are no more, but the farms remain	0
NewsClaims	4581	A billboard once stood in the middle of town that proclaimed Medford, Wisconsin, as the Mink Capital of the World.	0
NewsClaims	4582	That crossroads is now the home of the Taylor County Museum, where by coincidence, Mary Schultz of the Taylor County Historical Society, a longtime area resident, just finished curating an exhibit about the annual Medford Mink Festival once held there.	0
NewsClaims	4583	Schultz described the exhibit: a small space, full of mink-covered things.	0
NewsClaims	4584	"""It was a big thing back in the day,"" she said."	0
NewsClaims	4585	The weeklong festival, first held in 1964, included a pageant to choose a Miss Medford Mink Princess from among the local high-schoolers.	0
NewsClaims	4586	(The exhibit includes scrapbooks of all the princesses.)	0
NewsClaims	4587	The pageant included a swimsuit competition, though, thankfully, no mink bikinis.	0
NewsClaims	4588	Many items that would not spring to mind as wanting a bit of fur were made of or topped with a bit of fur, including toothpicks, a toothbrush, a men‚Äôs tie and a bowtie, cufflink mice, and a wallet.	0
NewsClaims	4589	"""I don‚Äôt know who in the world would wear that tie,"" Schultz said, amused."	0
NewsClaims	4590	The mink billboard came down, Schultz said, around when the mink festivals stopped‚Äîthe last Mink Princess picture is from 1979.	0
NewsClaims	4591	Today, even in Medford, mink ranches operate discreetly, as they have done ever since the anti-fur campaigns of the 1980s.	0
NewsClaims	4592	"""There‚Äôs a great big mink ranch up on a highway northeast of us,"" Schultz said."	0
NewsClaims	4593	"""There‚Äôs no sign out there that says what this is, and I don‚Äôt even know who owns it."""	0
NewsClaims	4594	An invisible industry	0
NewsClaims	4595	In her	0
NewsClaims	4596	Lancet	0
NewsClaims	4597	letter, Danish virologist Koopmans wrote that the outbreaks in her country should be a lesson for the fur sector worldwide.	0
NewsClaims	4598	"""(T)here is currently no global overview of the location of such farms, and no mandatory surveillance programme."	0
NewsClaims	4599	"In view of our observations, that is urgently needed."""	0
NewsClaims	4600	That will be no easy task.	0
NewsClaims	4601	In Wisconsin, the mink industry was so under the radar that the Wisconsin state veterinarian, Darlene Konkle, had to ask the Fur Commission USA how to reach the farmers and how many there were.	0
NewsClaims	4602	"""Ordinarily, with mink farms, we don‚Äôt have a lot of contact with them,"" said Konkle, who works at the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection."	0
NewsClaims	4603	Just 19 of the state‚Äôs nearly 65,000 farms are mink farms.	0
NewsClaims	4604	Mink farmers today typically have thousands of animals‚Äîhundreds of thousands, even.	0
NewsClaims	4605	But mink are not considered livestock by Wisconsin law.	0
NewsClaims	4606	Mink farms do not need a license to operate.	0
NewsClaims	4607	DATCP does not inspect mink farms, register them, or survey them.	0
NewsClaims	4608	A similar situation pertains in Utah, where Utah state veterinarian David Taylor said in a December One Health conference call that investigators weren‚Äôt welcome at the start.	0
NewsClaims	4609	"""This industry is one that has innately a little bit of mistrust, because of the fact that they have been targets, oftentimes,"" Taylor said."	0
NewsClaims	4610	"""So they are very, very closed to having any outside people come onto their farms and see their operations."""	0
NewsClaims	4611	Nor were they keen on sacrificing more animals to assist the scientists with their mortality studies of the virus, just after they had lost so much, said Taylor.	0
NewsClaims	4612	"""So we had to find some compensation for mortality studies before we could even begin."	0
NewsClaims	4613	"And then they were also holding out for compensation for their losses."""	0
NewsClaims	4614	"With some ""creative financing"" by the Utah state legislature of CARES Act money, and diplomacy on the part of the government officials, Taylor said, the ranch gates began to open."	0
NewsClaims	4615	"""When they‚Äôre losing that volume of their business in just literally one week‚Äôs time, and they‚Äôve lost 50 percent of their breeders and several thousand mink, having someone come in and just understand that that‚Äôs life-shattering for them‚Äîthat was what opened up the door for communication."""	0
NewsClaims	4616	The culling controversy	0
NewsClaims	4617	Animal health authorities in the US could order mink culls, like those in Europe.	0
NewsClaims	4618	Wisconsin authorities have ordered culls in the past for other outbreaks, like on individual deer farms stricken with chronic wasting disease, but never for a whole industry.	0
NewsClaims	4619	But ordering a cull would require a complex legal process, and a mass quarantine of all farms.	0
NewsClaims	4620	"Suzanne Gibbons-Burgener, a public health veterinarian and infectious diseases epidemiologist at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, wrote, ""The decision to depopulate a group of animals is rarely the first response in a disease event and would typically only be necessary if the risk to human or animal health is significant, and other mitigation steps are insufficient to substantially reduce the risk."""	0
NewsClaims	4621	Animal rights groups see the mink outbreaks as another reason to ban the industry.	0
NewsClaims	4622	"The Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association, in a statement, called farmed mink a ""significant public health threat."""	0
NewsClaims	4623	Those in the mink industry called the European cull and calls for bans an overreaction.	0
NewsClaims	4624	But they also said the European situation differed in important ways.	0
NewsClaims	4625	"Denmark had way more mink, more farms‚Äînorth of a thousand‚Äîin an area ""a third the size of Wisconsin,"" Hildebrandt said, with a lot more people around."	0
NewsClaims	4626	Wisconsin‚Äôs few farms are mostly in sparsely populated rural areas.	0
NewsClaims	4627	Such spread has not been documented in America.	0
NewsClaims	4628	The Danish cull faced immediate backlash, prompted the resignation of the minister who ordered it, and was halted partway through.	0
NewsClaims	4629	But on December 21, Denmark‚Äôs parliament banned mink farming until 2022 and retroactively provided a legal basis for the cull, underscoring the seriousness of the risks.	0
NewsClaims	4630	Across Europe, millions of mink have died or been killed, the Dutch hastened a previously planned ban on fur farming, and France announced it would close its last four farms.	0
NewsClaims	4631	In contrast, China, also the biggest market for mink fur, has seen the European culls as a market opportunity and stepped up breeding.	0
NewsClaims	4632	The ballad of the wandering mink	0
NewsClaims	4633	How fluid are the boundaries between mink farms and the wild?	0
NewsClaims	4634	Pre-pandemic, American mink that escaped or were intentionally released from European farms were considered some of the worst invaders on the continent.	0
NewsClaims	4635	They established themselves quite handily, out-competed the native European mink, and caused all sorts of ecological damage.	0
NewsClaims	4636	But in North America, there‚Äôs not much accounting of how often farmed mink escape or what they have done with themselves.	0
NewsClaims	4637	This is partly because American mink already live in the wild, partly because mink farms are very discreet and not closely regulated, and most of all because very few people have looked.	0
NewsClaims	4638	The few include wildlife disease biologist Jeff Bowman and his colleagues at the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, who have long been researching the spread and impact of ranch escapees in their province.	0
NewsClaims	4639	It is usually obvious, Bowman said, which mink are wild and which are ranch-born, even in the trap.	0
NewsClaims	4640	Your wild mink is small, chocolate-brown, and bitey.	0
NewsClaims	4641	It does not come in sapphire, blue iris, white, palomino, or any other color that brings to mind a celebrity baby name, as your farmed mink does (these colors, incidentally, span white, gray, brown, and black).	0
NewsClaims	4642	A farmed mink has been raised on a twice-daily splat of high-quality agricultural leftovers, such as cheese, eggs, and sausage trimmings, is at least twice the size of a wild mink, and is more docile.	0
NewsClaims	4643	(In one YouTube video at a minkery, a white mink the size of a large housecat, in the arms of its handler, gently waves its paws and squints at the light.)	0

NewsClaims	4648	Near Ontario mink ranches, 64 percent of the mink trapped were either escapees or captive-wild hybrids.	0
NewsClaims	4649	When it comes to the coronavirus, Bowman said, these studies may be instructive.	0
NewsClaims	4650	"""Our studies showed that there are potential pathways for spread from farms to other wildlife,"" he said."	0
NewsClaims	4651	Some of the wild mink that Bowman tested were positive for Aleutian mink disease, which is a known problem on local mink farms, where it can cause reproductive failures and death.	0
NewsClaims	4652	The wild mink had their own strains of the Aleutian virus too‚Äîit could potentially go back and forth, Bowman said.	0
NewsClaims	4653	Bowman found that mink clearly escaped from certain problem farms much more than others.	0
NewsClaims	4654	When the researchers trapped farther afield, they found far fewer ranch-bred and hybrid mink, just 18 percent of the total.	0
NewsClaims	4655	It seemed the Ontario mink farm escapees hadn‚Äôt managed the sort of widespread invasion that was most worrisome.	0
NewsClaims	4656	Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources officials haven‚Äôt studied the issue of mink farm escapees like Canadian researchers have (though they are now considering more surveillance as part of the One Health investigation).	0
NewsClaims	4657	But Arnold Groehler, president of the Wisconsin Trappers Association, said he has been catching the odd mink-ranch escapee for many years.	0
NewsClaims	4658	"In the 1970s, he said, ""it was not uncommon to catch mink that had every phase of color there was."	0
NewsClaims	4659	"Jet black, pure white, some that looked like dairy cows."""	0
NewsClaims	4660	Hugh Hildebrandt, the Wisconsin mink vet, said the harsh economics of fur farming mostly solved the escape issues of yore.	0
NewsClaims	4661	The price of a pelt, which always fluctuated with high fashion‚Äôs whims, has for the past few years not even covered the roughly $35 cost of raising the animal.	0
NewsClaims	4662	The industry in Wisconsin began with small family farms over a century ago, and those remaining are still all family farms, even if some are now owned by large foreign companies.	0
NewsClaims	4663	But they are mostly large, with very secure fences.	0
NewsClaims	4664	The fences exist to keep wildlife like raccoons, skunks, and wild mink from helping themselves to the food supply or passing diseases to the captive mink.	0
NewsClaims	4665	Whenever Hildebrandt makes his rounds to a ranch, he checks the guard fence.	0
NewsClaims	4666	Because mink live in such tight quarters and are so vulnerable to disease, ranchers were careful about germs long before COVID struck, Hildebrandt said.	0
NewsClaims	4667	Some already required workers to shower before and after shifts.	0
NewsClaims	4668	It is also common to leave ranch clothes on the ranch, because mink are smelly.	0
NewsClaims	4669	Hildebrandt said mink operations are now limiting, as much as possible, how much they move or handle the animals.	0
NewsClaims	4670	Pelting, or mink harvesting, could not be put off, because it must be done as soon as the mink fur out each fall.	0
NewsClaims	4671	But most of that is done now.	0
NewsClaims	4672	At some ranches everyone arriving is photographed, to assist with contact tracing.	0
NewsClaims	4673	Workers and visitors are distanced and masked up, if not wearing the paper suits that health care workers don.	0
NewsClaims	4674	"""They wouldn‚Äôt last long with mink,"" Hildebrandt said."	0
NewsClaims	4675	The CDC sent a field team to Wisconsin that ran through safety procedures for workers and ran a national webinar for mink ranchers.	0
NewsClaims	4676	Government guidelines are all voluntary, except at the affected farms, which were quarantined.	0
NewsClaims	4677	At quarantined farms, anything coming in or out is controlled, including dead mink.	0
NewsClaims	4678	Scientists are still assessing how much risk the bodies pose, said Utah state veterinarian David Taylor, at the CDC‚Äôs December webinar on zoonotic disease updates.	0
NewsClaims	4679	Hot composting can kill pathogens, but it has to be done right.	0
NewsClaims	4680	"""After we went onto these farms and saw what they considered to be composting, which really were just piled-up mink, we made the decision here in Utah to just have these buried at landfills,"" he said."	0
NewsClaims	4681	"""We just felt like right now that was the quickest, easiest way to dispose of these animals and the most safe."""	0
NewsClaims	4682	(Pelts currently on the market are all pre-pandemic, from last year‚Äôs mink.)	0
NewsClaims	4683	So far the swabs haven‚Äôt turned up any virus, said Caitlin Cossaboom, a CDC veterinarian, in a December web presentation.	0
NewsClaims	4684	The question remains of how many farmed mink are out there, on the lam.	0
NewsClaims	4685	"Even in recent years, trapper Groehler has found a few mink with obvious ""heavy ranch genetics,"" which he suspects came from a few old-school ranches left in the area‚Äîthe sort that might be hand-feeding mink in small sheds."	0
NewsClaims	4686	Some escapees, he said, had become the bane of a trout hatchery near a small-scale mink ranch.	0
NewsClaims	4687	"""A lot of people have a mindset that if the ranch mink would escape, it wouldn‚Äôt survive in the wild‚Äîthey‚Äôre used to getting their food twice a day; they wouldn‚Äôt know how to hunt,"" he said."	0
NewsClaims	4688	"""But it‚Äôs interesting how things survive."	0
NewsClaims	4689	They adapt.	0
NewsClaims	4690	If you are hungry, you eat anything smaller than you.	0
NewsClaims	4691	"And when they find a wonderful food source like a fish hatchery, that‚Äôs like heaven on earth for them, and they‚Äôre staying put."""	0
NewsClaims	4692	Maybe mink are better at pandemics than we are?	0
NewsClaims	4693	Groehler worries about what SARS-CoV-2 might do among thousands of captive mink.	0
NewsClaims	4694	"""It can mutate from the mink, and what will it turn into next?"	0
NewsClaims	4695	What other animal species will it affect next?	0
NewsClaims	4696	"I don‚Äôt think anybody knows yet."""	0
NewsClaims	4697	The animals most at risk right now are the mink on farms‚Äîand perhaps their fellow captive mustelids, the endangered black-footed ferret.	0
NewsClaims	4698	These ferrets, once spread across much of the American West, have been reintroduced from near-extinction over the past 40 years through a painstaking captive breeding program, which includes artificial insemination and even training the kits how to hunt.	0
NewsClaims	4699	In northern Colorado, the National Black-Footed Ferret Conservation Center, which houses about 170 adult ferrets, or two-thirds of the captive breeding population, has locked down like a mink farm‚Äîno nonessential visitors allowed; handwashing, PPE, temperature checks, disinfection of cages.	0
NewsClaims	4700	The population of ferrets has been split into pods, much like American schoolchildren.	0
NewsClaims	4701	Before SARS-CoV-2, the ferrets‚Äô biggest threat was another zoonotic disease: sylvatic plague, from the same bacterium that causes bubonic plague.	0
NewsClaims	4702	It was also introduced by people, via ships.	0
NewsClaims	4703	For mink or ferrets, people are the disease reservoir.	0
NewsClaims	4704	Though perhaps there is relief in sight.	0
NewsClaims	4705	Some mink will be vaccinated before many of us are.	0
NewsClaims	4706	About 120 black-footed ferrets at the Colorado captive center have already been inoculated with an experimental vaccine created at the National Wildlife Health Center.	0
NewsClaims	4707	There are also some reasons for hope in the nature of the virus and the mink.	0
NewsClaims	4708	As infectious as it is, SARS-CoV-2 doesn‚Äôt seem to stick around long outside its hosts‚Äîunlike Aleutian mink disease virus, which lasts for months, or the chronic wasting disease-causing prions that can persist in soil for years.	0
NewsClaims	4709	The wild American mink, too, naturally follows CDC guidelines better than many of us have, preferring solitude to the company of its conspecifics.	0

VG	4914	It is crucial that this specialized form of bankruptcy relief for family farmers not be allowed to sunset for two fundamental reasons . 	1
VG	4915	First , family farmers , absent chapter 12 , would be forced to file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code ' s other al-ternatives , none of which work as well for them as does chapter 12 . 	0
VG	4916	Chapter VII of the Bankruptcy Code , for instance , would require a farmer to liquidate ; that is , sell the family farm to pay the claims of the farmer ' s credi-tors . 	0

VG	4918	Furthermore , Chapter XI , the Bankruptcy Code ' s business reorga-nization alternative , is not farmer-friendly in various respects , as it often entails an expensive and time-con-suming process that does not readily accommodate the special needs of farmers . 	0

VG	4958	I would reject the first hypothesis for two reasons . 	0
VG	4959	First , it is the practice of parliamentary draftsmen to show an abundance of caution and to favour the avoidance of doubt . 	0
VG	4960	In considering the intention of Parliament when passing the 1985 Act , or perhaps more properly the intention of the draftsman in settling its terms , there are three ( but only three ) hypotheses to be considered : ( 1 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was regarded as clear that the 1938 Act would continue to operate , in cases to which it applied , irrespective of the terms of Part V ; ( 2 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was not in the mind of the draftsman of Part V ; ( 3 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because Part V was not seen to encroach upon or conflict with the operation of section 5 . 	1

VG	4962	The Prime Minister has described global warming as the most serious environmental threat to the planet , and we know that a major accelerator is the emission of carbon dioxide and other carbon gases . 	0
VG	4963	British Energy has pointed out that the generation of about 64 TWh or 64 , 000 GWh by its nuclear power stations avoids the production and generation of about 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide . 	0
VG	4964	Secondly , had the draftsman conceived that a secure tenant ' s right to buy could be subject to a condition of ministerial consent under section 5 that right would not have been defined in section 118 in the terms quoted in paragraph 7 above , and provision would have been made for asserting and admitting or denying , and handling , claims to exercise the right to buy where ministerial consent was required . 	0
VG	4965	If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V . Had it been so intended , the draftsman would have imposed a duty on a local authority to refer to the Secretary of State a claim to exercise the right to buy made by a tenant whose case fell within section 5 . 	0

VG	4986	"According to Zheng , a good reason for Russia to help China is that "" Russia has considerable influence in the continents of Europe and Asia and will undoubtedly promote the setting up of China ' s position of a political great power in the world http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/china/doctrine/pills2/part07.htm "	0
VG	4987	Study Reports on the International Situation-1997-1998 , a yearly compilation of the views of authors from a variety of institutes published by the Chinese Society for Strategy and Management , contained an article that argues why Russia and China are very natural strategic partners . 	1
VG	4988	"The author , Zheng Yu , writes , "" Even if the next Russian President takes office with pro-Western influence in the year 2000 , Russia ' s unique diplomatic and cultural tradition , its consciousness as a great power , and the natural characteristics formed by the Orthodox Eastern Church will make it difficult "" for Russia to be part of the West .

VG	5016	But are the premises , in fact , true ? 	0
