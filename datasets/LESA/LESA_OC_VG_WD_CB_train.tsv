ClaimBuster	2179	It's no difference than this.	0
ClaimBuster	2180	We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.	1
ClaimBuster	2181	Well, we've seen what has happened.	0
ClaimBuster	2182	And if you open the airways to more things like this, you see it's not just you that are participating here.	0
ClaimBuster	2183	If I could say one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	2184	And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.	1
ClaimBuster	2185	And they look and they see.	0
ClaimBuster	2186	I can't tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters.	0
ClaimBuster	2187	It's not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted.	0
ClaimBuster	2188	I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable.	0
ClaimBuster	2189	We'll find out on November 8th.	0
ClaimBuster	2190	That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations.	0
ClaimBuster	2191	I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.	0
ClaimBuster	2192	Not with quotas, but help meet a goal of ownership of small businesses, for example.	0
ClaimBuster	2193	Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country.	0
ClaimBuster	2194	But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.	0
ClaimBuster	2195	As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that - to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	2196	The killer -- the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is in prison.	1
ClaimBuster	2197	Right now we heard it.	0
ClaimBuster	2198	Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	2199	Now, you're paying for that.	0
ClaimBuster	2200	And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.	1
ClaimBuster	2201	I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.	1
ClaimBuster	2202	What you have to decide is who's got the best economic plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2203	Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.	0
ClaimBuster	2204	You know, regulations cost the average family right here, Democrat or Republican, about $7,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	2205	And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command.	1
ClaimBuster	2206	But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and that's what I'm talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	2207	I believe it would return the government closer to the people, the way that Ross Perot is talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	2208	They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.	0
ClaimBuster	2209	I don't like to see the people in a deteriorating economy in a deteriorating country because our government has lost touch with the people.	0
ClaimBuster	2210	And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry.	0
ClaimBuster	2211	"Which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, ""It's my way or the highway,"" I don't get a lot done."	0
ClaimBuster	2212	You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	2213	And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2214	I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day.	0
ClaimBuster	2215	I would have hoped that the president of the United States would have been possible for him to indicate it clearly that uh - the Supreme Court decision was going to be carried out.	0
ClaimBuster	2216	We have no country if we have no border.	0
ClaimBuster	2217	I think you have to look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	2218	On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.	1
ClaimBuster	2219	The President in the election year decided I ought to do something, I haven't done anything on drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	2220	None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles.	0
ClaimBuster	2221	And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	2222	Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now -- over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children?	1
ClaimBuster	2223	But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2224	Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd be burdened.	1
ClaimBuster	2225	The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.	1
ClaimBuster	2226	They know what it's like not to have flexible working hours.	0
ClaimBuster	2227	When I was a boy it took 2 generations to double the standard of living.	1
ClaimBuster	2228	We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.	1
ClaimBuster	2229	I think that's the very best way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	2230	But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.	0
ClaimBuster	2231	That's one way one could do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2232	We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools.	0
ClaimBuster	2233	Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	2234	In addition to that, we ought to have a - a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located.	1
ClaimBuster	2235	And recently the Chinese have announced they are going to lower some barriers to our products, which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under Mr. Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	2236	Americans' workers are the best in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2237	Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?	0
ClaimBuster	2238	I thought the administration was opposed to the Midgetman.	0
ClaimBuster	2239	I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested - to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance - is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war.	0
ClaimBuster	2240	There's no question about that.	0
ClaimBuster	2241	He needed to be disarmed.	0
ClaimBuster	2242	But they certainly are a little nervous when Senator Obama says, if you don't get the health care policy that I think you should have, then you're going to get fined.	0
ClaimBuster	2243	It's going to go in the other direction, as they've estimated.	0
ClaimBuster	2244	I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade.	0
ClaimBuster	2245	Candy, it's not going to --	0
ClaimBuster	2246	But we've got to keep fighting on this war against drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	2247	I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances, and let's not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there.	1
ClaimBuster	2248	A President is called the Commander in Chief.	1
ClaimBuster	2249	I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.	0
ClaimBuster	2250	It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face.	1
ClaimBuster	2251	Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	2252	In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2253	As I told you, we've just got a report that said over the past 13 months, we've created 1.9 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	2254	We've got to go back and look.	0
ClaimBuster	2255	If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.	0
ClaimBuster	2256	I believe that we have uh - negotiated with the Soviet Union since I've been president from a position of strength.	1
ClaimBuster	2257	I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity.	0
ClaimBuster	2258	And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove -- to remove Assad.	0
ClaimBuster	2259	Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and we've been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now.	1
ClaimBuster	2260	They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school.	0
ClaimBuster	2261	It's probably going to take a much, much higher figure.	0
ClaimBuster	2262	And I said I make a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	2263	And I think I'm on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	2264	And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.	1
ClaimBuster	2265	We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	2266	And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America.	1
ClaimBuster	2267	The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.	0
ClaimBuster	2268	She came all the way from Iowa in a Winnebago with her poodle in order attend here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	2269	I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	2270	There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking.	0
ClaimBuster	2271	I think that should be a goal.	0
ClaimBuster	2272	And it's going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power.	0
ClaimBuster	2273	We tried six or eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	2274	I think they looked at that and saw weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	2275	I've also done everything I could at every moment of division in this country, after Oklahoma City, when these churches were burned, to bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity.	0
ClaimBuster	2276	We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together.	0
ClaimBuster	2277	And that's my view now.	0
ClaimBuster	2278	And it's -- our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and that's why we have to be humble.	0
ClaimBuster	2279	No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out.	1
ClaimBuster	2280	We learned from their mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	2281	We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...	1
ClaimBuster	2282	How many of you are under managed care plans?	0
ClaimBuster	2283	I think the American people are sick and tired of either/or solutions, people being pushed in the corner, polarized to extremes.	0
ClaimBuster	2284	Well -- well, I need to speak a moment...	0
ClaimBuster	2285	You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	2286	I think that's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	2287	We cannot be satisfied with what we've been doing for the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	2288	We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132,000-page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision.	0
ClaimBuster	2289	I think the president owes it to family values to show that he values America's families, whether they're people on welfare you're trying to move from welfare to work, the working poor whom I think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they've got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week, working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining; they deserve a strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	2290	I think it's important, since he talked about the Medicare plan, has he been in the United States Senate for 20 years?	1
ClaimBuster	2291	I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly.	1
ClaimBuster	2292	If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year today and you're trying to raise two children, for every additional dollar you earn you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making $200,000, and that's not right.	1
ClaimBuster	2293	They were just waiting to seize the opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	2294	And he just lifted martial law.	1
ClaimBuster	2295	And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.	0
ClaimBuster	2296	A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	2297	We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound.	0
ClaimBuster	2298	They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again.	0
ClaimBuster	2299	So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	2300	The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.	1
ClaimBuster	2301	No, I am not wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	2302	And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	2303	I -- I served as a missionary for my church.	1
ClaimBuster	2304	I mean, we've had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what's good for Wall Street, but not what's good for Main Street.	0
ClaimBuster	2305	In addition, we've brought down inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	2306	It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	2307	But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	2308	That's not what you did in that generation.	0
ClaimBuster	2309	I think we ought to have character education in our schools.	0
ClaimBuster	2310	I think that all new teachers ought to be tested in the subjects that they teach.	0
ClaimBuster	2311	But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the president made it illegal -- illegal -- for Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices.	1
ClaimBuster	2312	Republicans talk about it, but we're the first the first administration in anybody's lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row.	1
ClaimBuster	2313	We felt strongly about them, and they did so well by us.	0
ClaimBuster	2314	Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers.	0
ClaimBuster	2315	And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	2316	I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.	0
ClaimBuster	2317	The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.	1
ClaimBuster	2318	The Nicaraguans must know that it is the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundaries of their nation, not interfere in other nations.	0
ClaimBuster	2319	But it√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	2320	And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	2321	We didn't have the cuts the president promised he'd make and then he doubled.	1
ClaimBuster	2322	We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	2323	And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.	0
ClaimBuster	2324	George Bush believes in them.	0
ClaimBuster	2325	I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject.	0
ClaimBuster	2326	And I'm saying, where is this?	0
ClaimBuster	2327	"I believe that -- I believe they've moved that sign, ""The buck stops here"" from the Oval Office desk to ""The buck stops here"" on the Lincoln bedroom."	0
ClaimBuster	2328	And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.	0
ClaimBuster	2329	Every President until this one has been able to do it, and this nation -- or the world is more dangerous as a result.	0
ClaimBuster	2330	Americans are angry, they're upset, and they're a little fearful.	0
ClaimBuster	2331	Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.	1
ClaimBuster	2332	You don't muddle through the central front on terror and you don't muddle through going after bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	2333	But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.	0
ClaimBuster	2334	I see a young man who is a knowledgeable-in defense and there are three people on our ticket that are knowledgeable-in the whole-in the race-knowledgeable in defense and Dan Quayle is one of them and I am one of them.	0
ClaimBuster	2335	And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2336	Our health-care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the nation's capital.	0
ClaimBuster	2337	That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	2338	Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem.	0
ClaimBuster	2339	I mean that's what, I want to stop it from coming across the border.	0
ClaimBuster	2340	I'll never give a veto over American security to any other entity -- not a nation, not a country, not an institution.	0
ClaimBuster	2341	And I have made some good sound proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	2342	What I think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika and glasnost, welcome them, but keep our eyes open.	0
ClaimBuster	2343	But I think it's about his priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	2344	Now we have to create those jobs, now that we're requiring people to go do work.	0
ClaimBuster	2345	Well, Jim, I want to thank you and thank the folks here at Washington University and the vice president.	0
ClaimBuster	2346	I went to a boys' club.	1
ClaimBuster	2347	But at some point, we want to do that as well.	0
ClaimBuster	2348	I don't want to go back to malaise and misery index.	0
ClaimBuster	2349	I think you have to knock out ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	2350	I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.	1
ClaimBuster	2351	And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.	1
ClaimBuster	2352	Yes, let me respond to this.	0
ClaimBuster	2353	Do you know today that the Com- the Russians broadcast ten times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do?	1
ClaimBuster	2354	me that the Federal grants that come with.	0
ClaimBuster	2355	We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	2356	He's added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together.	1
ClaimBuster	2357	It's inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is I've reduced the size of government more than my Republican predecessors.	1
ClaimBuster	2358	We've put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and that's good and that's helped.	1
ClaimBuster	2359	Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	2360	We need to invest and save.	0
ClaimBuster	2361	The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 - measured in real dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	2362	But just one point I want to make, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	2363	I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.	0
ClaimBuster	2364	We've got to attack at all points, we've go to use undercover operations.	0
ClaimBuster	2365	But let me also point out that to several parliaments around the world, in Europe and in Asia, I have made a statement to each one of them, and I'll repeat it here: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.	1
ClaimBuster	2366	We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	2367	I'd like to respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	2368	He offers retreads of programs that failed.	1
ClaimBuster	2369	I'd say around 30 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	2370	I think this is a great country, because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better.	0
ClaimBuster	2371	Do you believe in MAD, mutual assured destruction, mutual deterrence as it has been practiced for the last generation?	0
ClaimBuster	2372	That's the way you help people.	0
ClaimBuster	2373	A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor, telling the patient, you need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure, your health requires it.	0
ClaimBuster	2374	I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night.	0
ClaimBuster	2375	And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.	1
ClaimBuster	2376	... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	2377	Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.	0
ClaimBuster	2378	And that's why I'm trying to do something about it by stimulating the export, vesting more, better education systems.	0
ClaimBuster	2379	Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up.	0
ClaimBuster	2380	Not working with government alone, but all of us working together.	0
ClaimBuster	2381	Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.	1
ClaimBuster	2382	So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that's already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.	1
ClaimBuster	2383	That was my posture as well.	0
ClaimBuster	2384	Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now.	1
ClaimBuster	2385	It's time for the man to leave.	0
ClaimBuster	2386	Cutting our investments in research and technology, that's not a smart choice.	0
ClaimBuster	2387	And it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control.	0
ClaimBuster	2388	We've read their accounts now about what happened.	1
ClaimBuster	2389	People can look it up, you're right.	0
ClaimBuster	2390	If you've got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it.	0
ClaimBuster	2391	Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.	1
ClaimBuster	2392	He actually got the first question.	1
ClaimBuster	2393	If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we've b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree.	0
ClaimBuster	2394	Now that's not reform, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	2395	In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2396	And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.	0
ClaimBuster	2397	And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	2398	No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.	0
ClaimBuster	2399	My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine.	1
ClaimBuster	2400	He is right that I'm not in favor of energy taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	2401	You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and I'd say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it.	0
ClaimBuster	2402	Uh - we've always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed, but the passage of them has been uh - fairly slow, and uh - few and far between.	0
ClaimBuster	2403	It ought to be tried.	0
ClaimBuster	2404	We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	2405	They have to pay up.	0
ClaimBuster	2406	I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.	0
ClaimBuster	2407	The issue is what you do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2408	We ought to keep making those extra effort Affirmative Action programs, the law and the policy of the land.	0
ClaimBuster	2409	If that were true, why didn't we identify ourselves with the people of Africa?	0
ClaimBuster	2410	The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	2411	And we knew the limits on their nuclear power.	0
ClaimBuster	2412	I've lived the American dream; I'd like for your children to be able to live it, too.	0
ClaimBuster	2413	That's exactly what we're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	2414	And that's why I have made it a number one priority in my budget, not a tax cut for the wealthy.	1
ClaimBuster	2415	I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and that's been my career in the United States Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	2416	As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil.	1
ClaimBuster	2417	Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	2418	I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending.	0
ClaimBuster	2419	And I've covered it again and again in print and on television.	1
ClaimBuster	2420	One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with.	1
ClaimBuster	2421	It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats, let's come together to do what is right for America.	0
ClaimBuster	2422	Tell you what I hear.	0
ClaimBuster	2423	Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here.	0
ClaimBuster	2424	On the tax cut, it's a big decision.	0
ClaimBuster	2425	I remember the floods that swept our state.	0
ClaimBuster	2426	But I'll tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, I'd be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda.	0
ClaimBuster	2427	I think we ought to focus on the problems and not attack each other.	0
ClaimBuster	2428	George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal.	1
ClaimBuster	2429	The American people should make up their own mind.	0
ClaimBuster	2430	I did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	2431	And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.	1
ClaimBuster	2432	There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	2433	Well, we may not be there yet but we're not going to get there by giving preferences and quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	2434	Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬§ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support.	0
ClaimBuster	2435	It will remain strong, so long as I'm the president.	0
ClaimBuster	2436	A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	2437	And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the prime minister of Canada, I might add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	2438	We've upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terrorist.	1
ClaimBuster	2439	Well, we're $4 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	2440	And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.	1
ClaimBuster	2441	We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn't pass the House.	1
ClaimBuster	2442	I will work with Republicans and Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	2443	Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products.	1
ClaimBuster	2444	Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don't pay for money, you realize there's quite a spread, right, and you realize this is a temporary thing and there's going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof.	0
ClaimBuster	2445	I have never said I would liquidate...	1
ClaimBuster	2446	"The real mistake was the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place."	0
ClaimBuster	2447	I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will.	0
ClaimBuster	2448	The real problem in this country is that most people are working hard and falling farther behind.	0
ClaimBuster	2449	And I'm going to put in place a better homeland security effort.	0
ClaimBuster	2450	You know, the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra.	1
ClaimBuster	2451	And it wasn't me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws.	1
ClaimBuster	2452	But I'll never fail to protect the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	2453	There's now a general strike going on.	1
ClaimBuster	2454	In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	2455	Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.	1
ClaimBuster	2456	And I'm very, very proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	2457	The same is true of highways.	1
ClaimBuster	2458	I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	2459	Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question.	0
ClaimBuster	2460	Secondly, if it is correct, have you informed yourself in the meantime?	0
ClaimBuster	2461	We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.	0
ClaimBuster	2462	But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2463	I happen to like President Clinton personally.	0
ClaimBuster	2464	We had some fun Crystal Gayle and Loretta Lynn with us, and they got up and sang, went to little towns and I talked agriculture.	1
ClaimBuster	2465	I don't blame them entirely for it.	0
ClaimBuster	2466	And we have a winning fight.	0
ClaimBuster	2467	And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?	0
ClaimBuster	2468	Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.	1
ClaimBuster	2469	First we have to understand that SALT I expires October third 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	2470	They're reliable friends in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	2471	And it's time we take a look at the pay scales.	0
ClaimBuster	2472	First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.	0
ClaimBuster	2473	I had the chance to be governor of a state.	1
ClaimBuster	2474	I've got a policy for the future and agenda for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	2475	I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.	1
ClaimBuster	2476	When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.	1
ClaimBuster	2477	Tell him you can have everything you got.	0
ClaimBuster	2478	My opponent, the senator, talks about foreign policy.	1
ClaimBuster	2479	What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate reforms.	1
ClaimBuster	2480	I will try to do the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	2481	The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.	0
ClaimBuster	2482	And that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.	0
ClaimBuster	2483	Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what you're saying.	1
ClaimBuster	2484	Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America.	1
ClaimBuster	2485	That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	2486	But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.	1
ClaimBuster	2487	But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, I'm not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that.	1
ClaimBuster	2488	That starts putting the squeeze on them.	0
ClaimBuster	2489	And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	2490	And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?	1
ClaimBuster	2491	And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	2492	I mean, he can throw out all kinds -- I don't know the particulars of this law.	0
ClaimBuster	2493	... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...	0
ClaimBuster	2494	Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.	1
ClaimBuster	2495	And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.	0
ClaimBuster	2496	"I was a little disappointed in Magic because he came to me and I said, ""Now if you see something we're not doing, get ahold of me."	0
ClaimBuster	2497	We uh - have got to do that at the federal government level.	0
ClaimBuster	2498	I have so many things there to respond to, I'm going to pick out something you said earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	2499	We're going to have a hard time rebuilding it.	0
ClaimBuster	2500	It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't.	0
ClaimBuster	2501	You're seeing it right now in the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	2502	Our people are out of work, and there's a sense of withdrawal.	0
ClaimBuster	2503	And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.	0
ClaimBuster	2504	Number two, we're going to have to stop illegal immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	2505	They're not as stupid as Washington thinks they are.	0
ClaimBuster	2506	And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.	0
ClaimBuster	2507	I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.	0
ClaimBuster	2508	And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.	0
ClaimBuster	2509	I've got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem.	0
ClaimBuster	2510	He didn't do all these things.	1
ClaimBuster	2511	"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it."""	0
ClaimBuster	2512	I believe that our future as a nation depends upon whether or not we can break down these barriers that have been used to pit group against group, and bring our people together.	0
ClaimBuster	2513	I know what strong political leadership is.	0
ClaimBuster	2514	And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.	1
ClaimBuster	2515	They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.	1
ClaimBuster	2516	Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?	0
ClaimBuster	2517	But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	2518	I'm going to be running an ad pretty soon that shows they promised us they were going to hold the line on spending at the tax and budget summit, and I'm going to show how much they've increased this little stuff they do for themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	2519	He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	2520	Come on, give me five.	0
ClaimBuster	2521	and that's simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did.	1
ClaimBuster	2522	So I'm not going to begin, and I'm not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when we're spending billions on something like Star Wars, when we're spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place, but which, if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means.	0
ClaimBuster	2523	In Puerto Rico this year, I met with six of the leading industrial nations' heads of state to meet the problem of inflation so we would be able to solve it before it got out of hand.	1
ClaimBuster	2524	and must do what he's talking about now.	0
ClaimBuster	2525	Five hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget.	1
ClaimBuster	2526	And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	2527	I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away.	0
ClaimBuster	2528	That's the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	2529	"And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice."""	1
ClaimBuster	2530	It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on.	1
ClaimBuster	2531	There's a difference in my opinion - uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary.	0
ClaimBuster	2532	It's a different world now.	0
ClaimBuster	2533	We didn't guard 850,000 tons of ammo.	1
ClaimBuster	2534	That's what I hope to get to talk about tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	2535	The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.	0
ClaimBuster	2536	We're the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2537	Is it President Obama's fault?	0
ClaimBuster	2538	And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch.	1
ClaimBuster	2539	We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th.	1
ClaimBuster	2540	Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.	0
ClaimBuster	2541	I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year.	1
ClaimBuster	2542	We're going to go through a period of shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	2543	But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.	1
ClaimBuster	2544	But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own.	1
ClaimBuster	2545	In addition to that, I believe we have a crisis here at home, a crisis of the middle class that is increasingly squeezed, health-care costs going up.	1
ClaimBuster	2546	What I've had as a basic commitment since I've been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.	1
ClaimBuster	2547	And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line.	0
ClaimBuster	2548	And we'll continue to spread freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	2549	So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent.	0
ClaimBuster	2550	Employers of under 50 are exempted.	1
ClaimBuster	2551	The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.	1
ClaimBuster	2552	What I'd also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	2553	That's why the Patriot Act was important.	0
ClaimBuster	2554	Sometimes my advice has been taken.	0
ClaimBuster	2555	The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn't sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.	1
ClaimBuster	2556	The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2557	I think a lot of it uh - depends on current events - uh - sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs.	0
ClaimBuster	2558	Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	2559	By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000.	1
ClaimBuster	2560	I just want to make -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing.	0
ClaimBuster	2561	I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.	0
ClaimBuster	2562	I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	2563	In the cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the secretary of transportation, Bill Coleman.	0
ClaimBuster	2564	I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.	0
ClaimBuster	2565	You know, the American people are fair.	0
ClaimBuster	2566	Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilization's history.	0
ClaimBuster	2567	You've got to read what he said.	0
ClaimBuster	2568	perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government.	0
ClaimBuster	2569	I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about two months ago that the exits are clearly marked.	1
ClaimBuster	2570	You see, there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	2571	And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything.	1
ClaimBuster	2572	The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.	0
ClaimBuster	2573	Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.	1
ClaimBuster	2574	I have never promised more than I could produce and I have produced everything that I promised.	0
ClaimBuster	2575	That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.	0
ClaimBuster	2576	He also said in December of 2003 that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be president.	1
ClaimBuster	2577	This has been their primary focus.	1
ClaimBuster	2578	Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat .	0
ClaimBuster	2579	I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time.	0
ClaimBuster	2580	The treaty does not include these two islands.	1
ClaimBuster	2581	This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	2582	That uh - situation called for me to first put the United States on a steady course and to keep our keel well balanced, because we had to face the difficult problems that had all of a sudden hit America.	0
ClaimBuster	2583	And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.	1
ClaimBuster	2584	For those of you for my opponent, please only vote once.	0
ClaimBuster	2585	I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on 1 thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	2586	I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can't have any tax cut that's not paid for.	0
ClaimBuster	2587	The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in.	0
ClaimBuster	2588	And if we can't love one another, we ought to get along with one another.	0
ClaimBuster	2589	Values begin at the top, in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	2590	Let's look at the other side of the coin.	0
ClaimBuster	2591	I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall.	0
ClaimBuster	2592	Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission.	1
ClaimBuster	2593	We need to deny them the recruits.	0
ClaimBuster	2594	I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	2595	If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.	0
ClaimBuster	2596	This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	2597	One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits.	0
ClaimBuster	2598	All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.	0
ClaimBuster	2599	When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.	1
ClaimBuster	2600	You want to have a new program in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2601	People who pay taxes will get tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	2602	We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.	0
ClaimBuster	2603	So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.	0
ClaimBuster	2604	Every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan.	1
ClaimBuster	2605	This issue has been too long on the table because it's been a political issue.	1
ClaimBuster	2606	So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	2607	Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	2608	I just believe it's time to change.	0
ClaimBuster	2609	Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people.	1
ClaimBuster	2610	I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.	0
ClaimBuster	2611	It should have never happened.	0
ClaimBuster	2612	In terms of vetoing tax bills, you're darn right.	0
ClaimBuster	2613	Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.	0
ClaimBuster	2614	But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid.	0
ClaimBuster	2615	I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.	0
ClaimBuster	2616	And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments.	0
ClaimBuster	2617	We're going to see that it doesn't.	0
ClaimBuster	2618	And so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.	0
ClaimBuster	2619	I believe that this party - Republican party - has stood still really for twenty-five years - its leadership has.	0
ClaimBuster	2620	Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia.	0
ClaimBuster	2621	We did not go as a last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	2622	Nobody knows who hired this man.	1
ClaimBuster	2623	Well, I don't have any idea but I hope it will happen some time in my lifetime.	0
ClaimBuster	2624	I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war.	0
ClaimBuster	2625	I'm Chairman of the President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help.	1
ClaimBuster	2626	I want to say something, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	2627	Show me one accomplishment toward Medicare that he accomplished.	0
ClaimBuster	2628	He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	2629	Medical liability issues are a problem, a significant problem.	1
ClaimBuster	2630	Doctors are giving prescriptions, they're recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies.	1
ClaimBuster	2631	Secondly, of course we've been involved with Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	2632	We cannot, of course, control the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	2633	But there's no doubt there's a lot of opposition to it in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	2634	And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.	0
ClaimBuster	2635	I don't like that idea.	0
ClaimBuster	2636	In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.	1
ClaimBuster	2637	Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.	0
ClaimBuster	2638	But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	2639	And she can say all she wants about college tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	2640	On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	2641	We added 1.9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.	1
ClaimBuster	2642	Do you realize, 900,000 small businesses will be taxed under his plan because most small businesses are Subchapter S corps or limited partnerships, and they pay tax at the individual income tax level.	1
ClaimBuster	2643	Now I believe there's a better way to do this.	0
ClaimBuster	2644	Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	2645	And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.	1
ClaimBuster	2646	Now, the problem is that they didn't think these things through properly.	1
ClaimBuster	2647	And - and that's a reversal of position uh by the Burger Court with which I do agree.	1
ClaimBuster	2648	I think you ought to have at least one answer to it.	0
ClaimBuster	2649	Number 2, if you don't rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we won't be a superpower.	0
ClaimBuster	2650	What message does that send the Iraqis?	0
ClaimBuster	2651	This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it.	1
ClaimBuster	2652	You have to work on this day in and day out, every month ,every year, every issue, to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade.	0
ClaimBuster	2653	He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.	1
ClaimBuster	2654	You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.	0
ClaimBuster	2655	You know, the President reminds me sometimes of my brother Kenny, who is no longer alive.	1
ClaimBuster	2656	These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment.	0
ClaimBuster	2657	Because of the president's decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	2658	And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering.	1
ClaimBuster	2659	How much did you cut them by, then?	0
ClaimBuster	2660	In fact, it doesn't ask you to do anything -- if you don't want to take it, you don't have to.	0
ClaimBuster	2661	And we've got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don't ever torture a prisoner ever again.	0
ClaimBuster	2662	China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2663	So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	2664	They don't want this arms race.	0
ClaimBuster	2665	The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it.	1
ClaimBuster	2666	We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.	0
ClaimBuster	2667	There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here.	1
ClaimBuster	2668	We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and we're asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	2669	Well, people got their checks, and they'll continue to get their checks.	1
ClaimBuster	2670	They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through.	0
ClaimBuster	2671	That's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.	0
ClaimBuster	2672	The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.	0
ClaimBuster	2673	And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.	0
ClaimBuster	2674	More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and we'll have more manufacturing and sales around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2675	Builders and community leaders are ready.	0
ClaimBuster	2676	I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you don't want in your house.	0
ClaimBuster	2677	And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2678	Uh - I obviously don't think it's valid.	0
ClaimBuster	2679	His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing.	1
ClaimBuster	2680	So, why should we believe that they had placed that much more reliance on land-based?	0
ClaimBuster	2681	The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight.	0
ClaimBuster	2682	If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?	0
ClaimBuster	2683	Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.	0
ClaimBuster	2684	And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.	0
ClaimBuster	2685	Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	2686	In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed.	1
ClaimBuster	2687	This is what Ross Perot complains about.	0
ClaimBuster	2688	But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.	0
ClaimBuster	2689	And, again, I know those situations.	0
ClaimBuster	2690	The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.	1
ClaimBuster	2691	I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	2692	And I hope we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	2693	I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food.	1
ClaimBuster	2694	It's supposed to come from the people, it comes at the people.	0
ClaimBuster	2695	If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	2696	We are the greatest country on the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	2697	We know how to set agendas.	0
ClaimBuster	2698	I hope you will look at the ideas in it.	0
ClaimBuster	2699	Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this -- this event.	0
ClaimBuster	2700	It's a question of who they are.	0
ClaimBuster	2701	Let's look at the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	2702	See, for 45 years we were preoccupied with the Red Army.	1
ClaimBuster	2703	And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	2704	Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.	1
ClaimBuster	2705	We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.	0
ClaimBuster	2706	Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva.	1
ClaimBuster	2707	And that's why we're doing what we're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	2708	If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American.	0
ClaimBuster	2709	Can I make another point?	0
ClaimBuster	2710	You're putting a lot of business people out of business.	0
ClaimBuster	2711	It's illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	2712	So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that's the right way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	2713	Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	2714	We've got to change the system.	0
ClaimBuster	2715	Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	2716	We have concluded with Japan 21 -- about to be 22 -- trade agreements now.	1
ClaimBuster	2717	Now right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the state of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	2718	If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.	0
ClaimBuster	2719	He chose a tax cut for wealthy Americans over the things that I listed to you.	0
ClaimBuster	2720	Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened.	0
ClaimBuster	2721	We've got 1,000 extra border patrol on the southern border; want 1,000 on the northern border.	1
ClaimBuster	2722	If we're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level.	0
ClaimBuster	2723	I want to take very dollar by which we reduce defense and reinvest it in technologies for the 21st century--in new transportation, in communication, in environmental clean-up technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	2724	When you don't have any ideas, you don't have any agenda, and all you have is fear, that's all you can use.	0
ClaimBuster	2725	You can look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	2726	And for me, this is about jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2727	And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families.	0
ClaimBuster	2728	We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we're seeing them.	0
ClaimBuster	2729	But I think it's time to talk about the future.	0
ClaimBuster	2730	... $4 billion tax benefit for your family.	1
ClaimBuster	2731	I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	2732	We have restored much of our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	2733	He's already got $3 trillion, according to The Washington Post, of expenses that he's put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for.	1
ClaimBuster	2734	We had a recession in fifty-four.	1
ClaimBuster	2735	We can't stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	2736	The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive and, at the same time, spread liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	2737	I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	2738	Now, I voted for the Patriot Act.	1
ClaimBuster	2739	Why aren't you putting some money in?	0
ClaimBuster	2740	"And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, ""Well Obama didn't try."""	0
ClaimBuster	2741	But under our constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard and you do what you're supposed to do, you are entitled to equal treatment.	0
ClaimBuster	2742	And, look, this hasn't been an easy decision for me to meet.	0
ClaimBuster	2743	It's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.	0
ClaimBuster	2744	But I must tell you, I think legalization of narcotics, or something of that nature, in the face of the medical evidence, would be totally counterproductive.	0
ClaimBuster	2745	Ten million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming presidential election.	1
ClaimBuster	2746	And I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.	1
ClaimBuster	2747	And Republicans and Democrats both love America.	0
ClaimBuster	2748	But if those Mom and Pop stores all get together and pool, they too can bring the cost of insurance down.	1
ClaimBuster	2749	And those grants which make it possible for states and local communities to clean up rivers and harbors and streams.	0
ClaimBuster	2750	And as governor of my state, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults.	1
ClaimBuster	2751	Also I got a philosophical difference.	0
ClaimBuster	2752	I proposed a plan, detailed budget, that shows us cutting the deficit in half by five years.	1
ClaimBuster	2753	So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it.	0
ClaimBuster	2754	It's hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free.	0
ClaimBuster	2755	They've held a torch for the world to see -- the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	2756	This is the major recommendation that he's made.	1
ClaimBuster	2757	It's to make sure our troops are well-housed and well-equipped.	0
ClaimBuster	2758	That's why I'm for Stealth technology, to build a Stealth bomber -- which I've supported for years -- that can penetrate the Soviet air defense system without any hope that they can perceive where it is because their radar system is frustrated.	0
ClaimBuster	2759	Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights.	0
ClaimBuster	2760	One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul.	0
ClaimBuster	2761	You pay $500 for a $5 hammer, you're not buying strength.	0
ClaimBuster	2762	To go back to the very, very first question.	0
ClaimBuster	2763	Bill of Rights - the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education.	1
ClaimBuster	2764	Modernize our schools, reduce class size, recruit new teachers, give every child a chance to learn with one-on-one time in a quality -- high-quality, safe school.	0
ClaimBuster	2765	And I do favor the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	2766	They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments.	0
ClaimBuster	2767	I picked Lloyd Bentsen, because I thought he was the best qualified person for the job.	0
ClaimBuster	2768	And you have 30-some in your administration, either left or being investigated or in jail or whatever, then you've got an ethical problem.	1
ClaimBuster	2769	We're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	2770	Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.	1
ClaimBuster	2771	So we can do a better job of homeland security.	0
ClaimBuster	2772	I was the first United States president to visit Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	2773	We have to tell the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	2774	We had a war when we came into power in 1953.	1
ClaimBuster	2775	By Russia or anybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	2776	More in September than in August.	1
ClaimBuster	2777	I didn't do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army.	1
ClaimBuster	2778	Dick Cheney's counted as a small business.	1
ClaimBuster	2779	If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.	0
ClaimBuster	2780	And they're going now because of the policies of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	2781	But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2782	You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.	1
ClaimBuster	2783	But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap.	0
ClaimBuster	2784	Believed it in 1998 when Clinton was president.	0
ClaimBuster	2785	And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.	0
ClaimBuster	2786	I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this.	0
ClaimBuster	2787	And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	2788	This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.	1
ClaimBuster	2789	And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs.	1
ClaimBuster	2790	And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.	1
ClaimBuster	2791	And they are being slaughtered...	1
ClaimBuster	2792	But it's also put an enormous strain on our budget.	1
ClaimBuster	2793	You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.	1
ClaimBuster	2794	I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.	0
ClaimBuster	2795	We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	2796	Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	2797	I've negotiated at Vladivostok with uh - Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs.	1
ClaimBuster	2798	And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending.	0
ClaimBuster	2799	We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.	1
ClaimBuster	2800	That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money.	0
ClaimBuster	2801	That's going to be critical.	0
ClaimBuster	2802	We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it.	0
ClaimBuster	2803	In the meantime, there has developed the problem of the Soviet Backfire - their high-performance aircraft which they say is not a long-range aircraft and which some of our people say is a intercontinental aircraft.	1
ClaimBuster	2804	Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention.	0
ClaimBuster	2805	The first time -- and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen -- once, and sometimes twice -- the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember.	1
ClaimBuster	2806	That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government.	1
ClaimBuster	2807	And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now.	0
ClaimBuster	2808	Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us.	0
ClaimBuster	2809	I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2810	Perhaps we might find that out tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	2811	I'm asking the people's support as president.	0
ClaimBuster	2812	I think I remember the question.	0
ClaimBuster	2813	I don't want the law to supersede good law like we've got in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	2814	We are a big industrial state.	1
ClaimBuster	2815	Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere.	1
ClaimBuster	2816	And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs.	0
ClaimBuster	2817	Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.	1
ClaimBuster	2818	We increased them to China 50 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2819	One final point if I might.	0
ClaimBuster	2820	In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change.	0
ClaimBuster	2821	It's a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other.	1
ClaimBuster	2822	They develop a positive or negative self- image.	0
ClaimBuster	2823	There's no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2824	And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy.	0
ClaimBuster	2825	And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly.	0
ClaimBuster	2826	Now, again, to get to whether I am depending on magic, I think I have talked in straight economic terms about a program of recovery that I was told wouldn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	2827	Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in 1947.	1
ClaimBuster	2828	You remember the last debate?	0
ClaimBuster	2829	Now, the math doesn't work, but he continues to claim that he's going to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	2830	Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget.	0
ClaimBuster	2831	And I believe that he will be outstanding.	0
ClaimBuster	2832	Who's he gonna listen to -- us or the folks running up and down the aisles with money, the lobbyists, the PAC money?	0
ClaimBuster	2833	Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.	0
ClaimBuster	2834	And you know, I don't think age is the only criterion.	0
ClaimBuster	2835	And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	2836	And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	2837	She's not doing any me favors.	0
ClaimBuster	2838	The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	2839	It's time to end it.	0
ClaimBuster	2840	You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost.	1
ClaimBuster	2841	I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.	1
ClaimBuster	2842	Now, here's what I want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2843	Folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	2844	He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2845	How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been.	0
ClaimBuster	2846	That's what governors end up doing.	0
ClaimBuster	2847	And it's going to be tough.	0
ClaimBuster	2848	Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	2849	Now, as for the proposals that I've worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	2850	And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.	1
ClaimBuster	2851	I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.	0
ClaimBuster	2852	It did not do what it needed to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2853	In fact, I think just the opposite.	0
ClaimBuster	2854	It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.	0
ClaimBuster	2855	It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.	0
ClaimBuster	2856	And if we're going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	2857	What we do is we have choice.	0
ClaimBuster	2858	There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.	1
ClaimBuster	2859	We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	2860	Well, Fiora (ph), I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate.	0
ClaimBuster	2861	I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	2862	And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.	0
ClaimBuster	2863	Well, the Administration was the first major country to stand up to the abuse in Tiananmen Square.	1
ClaimBuster	2864	In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...	1
ClaimBuster	2865	Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.	1
ClaimBuster	2866	I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it.	0
ClaimBuster	2867	Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?	0
ClaimBuster	2868	Panama is a friendly country.	0
ClaimBuster	2869	In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.	0
ClaimBuster	2870	And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	2871	I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us.	0
ClaimBuster	2872	So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.	0
ClaimBuster	2873	I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil.	1
ClaimBuster	2874	I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around.	1
ClaimBuster	2875	The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.	0
ClaimBuster	2876	They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.	1
ClaimBuster	2877	I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.	1
ClaimBuster	2878	I would like to tell you something about me.	0
ClaimBuster	2879	That's what he stated, again, a matter of record.	1
ClaimBuster	2880	I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.	0
ClaimBuster	2881	The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and that's the way it's been done.	1
ClaimBuster	2882	And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China.	0
ClaimBuster	2883	He said trickle-down economics was voodoo economics; now he's it's biggest practitioner.	1
ClaimBuster	2884	When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff.	1
ClaimBuster	2885	On foreign affairs, some think it's irrelevant.	0
ClaimBuster	2886	He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	2887	It's the wrong thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2888	He says we ought to have gun-free schools.	1
ClaimBuster	2889	This is my point tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	2890	But, look, the nature of the challenges that we're going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that it's never the challenges that you expect.	0
ClaimBuster	2891	In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	2892	You don't buy any gun.	0
ClaimBuster	2893	We have committed $200 million worth of aid.	1
ClaimBuster	2894	In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.	0
ClaimBuster	2895	This is how I'm going to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	2896	I told her after we prayed and teared up and laughed some that I thought her husband's sacrifice was noble and worthy.	1
ClaimBuster	2897	And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2898	And therefore, if I only had another second left, I'd say that that high school class in a military training - 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country.	1
ClaimBuster	2899	The Patriot Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldn't talk to each other.	1
ClaimBuster	2900	I believe that the cruise missiles which we are now developing in research and development across the spectrum from air, from the sea, or from the land, uh - can be uh - included within a SALT II agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	2901	I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.	0
ClaimBuster	2902	His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	2903	He just declared it dead, ladies and gentlemen, and we walked away from the work of 160 nations over 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	2904	I've sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times.	1
ClaimBuster	2905	I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected.	0
ClaimBuster	2906	I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.	0
ClaimBuster	2907	George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was basically a welfare system.	1
ClaimBuster	2908	We're providing that young woman with help.	0
ClaimBuster	2909	It well describes the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	2910	I believe in local control of schools.	0
ClaimBuster	2911	We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over.	0
ClaimBuster	2912	I know because we did it there.	0
ClaimBuster	2913	There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	2914	Supposing we had - had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we'd had uh - Governor Carter as President.	0
ClaimBuster	2915	I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned.	1
ClaimBuster	2916	The fact is that my health-care plan, America, is very simple.	0
ClaimBuster	2917	I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	2918	But she wanted to look good for the election.	0
ClaimBuster	2919	I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker.	0
ClaimBuster	2920	First time one state had been number one in all four measures.	1
ClaimBuster	2921	What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.	0
ClaimBuster	2922	I'll give you everything I have, if you want me to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2923	If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, let's start with education.	0
ClaimBuster	2924	But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that we're not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.	0
ClaimBuster	2925	And I'm very proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	2926	The Dorgan Task Force, which included two internal revenue commissioners, one a Republican, one a Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	2927	We have to bring back law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	2928	Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick.	1
ClaimBuster	2929	And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.	0
ClaimBuster	2930	I want a check-off, so if the Congress can't do it, let people check off their income tax, 10% of it, to compel the government to cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	2931	He's going to probably go to jail.	0
ClaimBuster	2932	We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.	0
ClaimBuster	2933	Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time.	0
ClaimBuster	2934	So what we said was you can't just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it's most profitable for you.	0
ClaimBuster	2935	Yes, that's true, I didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	2936	During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action.	1
ClaimBuster	2937	I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.	0
ClaimBuster	2938	It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.	0
ClaimBuster	2939	You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	2940	But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.	0
ClaimBuster	2941	And I'm sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here.	1
ClaimBuster	2942	And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.	0
ClaimBuster	2943	There were a whole bunch of oil companies.	0
ClaimBuster	2944	And I do, both for corporations and for individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	2945	The American people now are facing, next Tuesday, a lonely decision.	0
ClaimBuster	2946	I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.	1
ClaimBuster	2947	I want my fellow Americans to hear one more time.	0
ClaimBuster	2948	If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.	0
ClaimBuster	2949	We are once again reliable suppliers and I would never use food as a political tool like our predecessors did.	1
ClaimBuster	2950	Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	2951	And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step.	0
ClaimBuster	2952	"He went to Cincinnati and he gave a speech in which he said, ""We will plan carefully."	1
ClaimBuster	2953	If the American people send me up to do this job, I intend to be there one term.	0
ClaimBuster	2954	So there was a lot at stake there.	0
ClaimBuster	2955	I have made a lot of decisions, and some of them little, like appointments to boards you never heard of, and some of them big.	1
ClaimBuster	2956	While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that's not how a commander in chief operates.	1
ClaimBuster	2957	No, because they've always wanted this to be an American effort.	1
ClaimBuster	2958	It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that they're not kept in the shadows of our society, that they're able to go back and forth to see their families.	1
ClaimBuster	2959	See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	2960	And the biggest threat facing America is terrorists with weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	2961	I apologize for it but that one got right to the national honor and I'm sorry.	0
ClaimBuster	2962	You know, my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt.	0
ClaimBuster	2963	Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America.	1
ClaimBuster	2964	She just went about 25 seconds over her time.	1
ClaimBuster	2965	And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.	0
ClaimBuster	2966	I want to move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	2967	This president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	2968	I have been for border security for years.	1
ClaimBuster	2969	If the president has any interest tonight, I'll detail it to you; I won't take 10 minutes tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	2970	Saddam Hussein was a threat because he could have given weapons of mass destruction to terrorist enemies.	0
ClaimBuster	2971	I just described what my plan is.	1
ClaimBuster	2972	Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	2973	Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition.	1
ClaimBuster	2974	But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.	0
ClaimBuster	2975	It's just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.	1
ClaimBuster	2976	And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.	1
ClaimBuster	2977	What I'm not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation.	0
ClaimBuster	2978	After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded.	1
ClaimBuster	2979	Now, Senator McCain talks a lot about earmarks.	1
ClaimBuster	2980	I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one.	1
ClaimBuster	2981	What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways.	0
ClaimBuster	2982	We do that all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	2983	I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.	1
ClaimBuster	2984	Either he's for the President and he's against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine - and the Senator's position itself, stated the other day in our debate - either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated.	0
ClaimBuster	2985	I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history.	0
ClaimBuster	2986	And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.	0
ClaimBuster	2987	I believe in protecting America first.	0
ClaimBuster	2988	And I think that we're better off, for example with the Philippines, of trying to retain our friendship and help them right the wrongs we see, rather than throwing them to the wolves and then facing a Communist power in the Pacific.	0
ClaimBuster	2989	And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because that's how the free enterprise system works.	1
ClaimBuster	2990	I think if we learned anything in Vietnam is you first commit this nation before you commit the troops to the battlefield.	0
ClaimBuster	2991	I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.	0
ClaimBuster	2992	I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.	1
ClaimBuster	2993	Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments as to how we ought to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	2994	...and -- and that's why I have the kind of commitment to ensure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful.	0
ClaimBuster	2995	The whole world is having economic difficulties.	1
ClaimBuster	2996	If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it.	0
ClaimBuster	2997	With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949.	1
ClaimBuster	2998	... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	2999	You will have the finest health care plan there is.	0
ClaimBuster	3000	We've had 4 years where we've produced no private sector jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	3001	Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax.	0
ClaimBuster	3002	Well, I just want to say...	0
ClaimBuster	3003	These kinds of things have hurt us very much.	0
ClaimBuster	3004	I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it.	1
ClaimBuster	3005	I must remind him the Democrats have controlled the Congress for the last twenty-two years and they wrote all the tax bills.	1
ClaimBuster	3006	Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.	0
ClaimBuster	3007	There've been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans.	1
ClaimBuster	3008	And by the way, I've done these things.	1
ClaimBuster	3009	Is anybody being discriminated against?	0
ClaimBuster	3010	We got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats.	1
ClaimBuster	3011	We need to be talking about space.	0
ClaimBuster	3012	But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.	1
ClaimBuster	3013	But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.	0
ClaimBuster	3014	We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.	0
ClaimBuster	3015	Will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards?	0
ClaimBuster	3016	It's all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals.	1
ClaimBuster	3017	What means something is: Do you have a plan?	0
ClaimBuster	3018	I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	3019	But let's at least focus...	0
ClaimBuster	3020	Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	3021	But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.	0
ClaimBuster	3022	India started from about the same place that China did.	0
ClaimBuster	3023	And I want to honor that among his other achievements here.	0
ClaimBuster	3024	Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.	0
ClaimBuster	3025	One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	3026	That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.	0
ClaimBuster	3027	I did the right decision.	0
ClaimBuster	3028	And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.	1
ClaimBuster	3029	What do you think they're going to do when the campaign's over?	0
ClaimBuster	3030	And with the plan that -- that I have, that will do that.	0
ClaimBuster	3031	This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	3032	Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	3033	The American people are up to here with debates.	0
ClaimBuster	3034	Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.	0
ClaimBuster	3035	For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core - below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh - power tightly sealed and a heavy - heavy vacuum maintained.	0
ClaimBuster	3036	Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.	0
ClaimBuster	3037	If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.	0
ClaimBuster	3038	Senator Obama talks about voting for budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	3039	He can't come here and tell you that he's left no child behind because he didn't fund no child left behind.	1
ClaimBuster	3040	The reason Magic Johnson resigned from the AIDS Commission is because the statement you heard tonight from Mr. Bush is the longest and best statement he's made about it in public.	1
ClaimBuster	3041	You can't stop all outsourcing, Charlie.	0
ClaimBuster	3042	But we have to use our military wisely.	0
ClaimBuster	3043	If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important.	0
ClaimBuster	3044	As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans.	0
ClaimBuster	3045	I met a young woman in -- in Philadelphia who's coming out of -- out of college, can't find work.	1
ClaimBuster	3046	All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	3047	And it's a long list of specific items.	0
ClaimBuster	3048	For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.	1
ClaimBuster	3049	And believe me, everybody on the factory floor all over this country knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	3050	This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America -- the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse.	0
ClaimBuster	3051	Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	3052	And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda.	0
ClaimBuster	3053	And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.	0
ClaimBuster	3054	You're going to have 120 to 150 new members of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	3055	That means those cars can be exported, 'cause that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it'll save money in your pocketbook.	1
ClaimBuster	3056	I will bring back jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	3057	That's going to help to create jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	3058	When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me.	1
ClaimBuster	3059	Otherwise, the world won't be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	3060	Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future?	0
ClaimBuster	3061	We're not going to go unilaterally.	0
ClaimBuster	3062	I think most people know that I did not seek the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	3063	We have it on tape.	1
ClaimBuster	3064	The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	3065	We also are pursuing housing programs.	1
ClaimBuster	3066	I -- I just have to correct the record here.	0
ClaimBuster	3067	How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	3068	"It's called ""Make America Great Again."""	1
ClaimBuster	3069	And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	3070	And this is known oil reserves, known supplies.	0
ClaimBuster	3071	And it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3072	Meanwhile, we started the -- also in '93 to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market and distribute their products to our kids.	1
ClaimBuster	3073	I served it uh - in the war.	1
ClaimBuster	3074	I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.	1
ClaimBuster	3075	I'm going to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	3076	You know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.	0
ClaimBuster	3077	I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.	0
ClaimBuster	3078	The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.	0
ClaimBuster	3079	And as a matter of principle -- and my situation is unique, and I understand it -- I would take absolutely no compensation; I go as their servant.	0
ClaimBuster	3080	We had a guarantee -- and what happened?	0
ClaimBuster	3081	Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.	0
ClaimBuster	3082	One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don't feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament.	1
ClaimBuster	3083	So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.	0
ClaimBuster	3084	I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.	1
ClaimBuster	3085	Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	3086	If people would say, well, he got elected to do this and then the Congress says, okay, I'm going to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3087	But this is an exciting time.	0
ClaimBuster	3088	We're working through the international organizations.	0
ClaimBuster	3089	We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments.	0
ClaimBuster	3090	... no troops through whatsoever.	1
ClaimBuster	3091	One, of course, is to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	3092	And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.	0
ClaimBuster	3093	Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	3094	When I got involved, I didn't fail.	1
ClaimBuster	3095	That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.	1
ClaimBuster	3096	And the president is moving to the creation of our own bunker- busting nuclear weapon.	1
ClaimBuster	3097	We lost three thousand American lives.	1
ClaimBuster	3098	The question, I think, should be enlarged.	0
ClaimBuster	3099	I say that to both political parties.	0
ClaimBuster	3100	We saw that message in the late 70s when heard a lot about change, and what happened, that misery index went right through the roof.	1
ClaimBuster	3101	He's 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	3102	He's also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	3103	Well, it was not one of my ads, either, Governor.	1
ClaimBuster	3104	So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away.	0
ClaimBuster	3105	The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	3106	Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	3107	Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	3108	And I will cut taxes for middle-class families.	0
ClaimBuster	3109	It is not a good deal for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	3110	And yet they were polled by the U.S.I.A.	1
ClaimBuster	3111	But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.	0
ClaimBuster	3112	So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.	0
ClaimBuster	3113	I will say this -	0
ClaimBuster	3114	So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.	0
ClaimBuster	3115	Now we tried to do this under President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	3116	I would not favor the uh - payment of uh - of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work.	0
ClaimBuster	3117	My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights.	1
ClaimBuster	3118	And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.	0
ClaimBuster	3119	And when we haven't done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks.	1
ClaimBuster	3120	But to add one other feature, I don't control any of the tapes.	1
ClaimBuster	3121	Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.	0
ClaimBuster	3122	Those are very clear differences.	0
ClaimBuster	3123	Now, he says he's only going to tax the rich.	1
ClaimBuster	3124	And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.	0
ClaimBuster	3125	... a very clear fact that...	0
ClaimBuster	3126	There are things we can do like the Kassebaum bill.	0
ClaimBuster	3127	In San Diego where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project for the University of California San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges, a little project in a program that Senator Dole opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	3128	We cannot let it happen.	0
ClaimBuster	3129	We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	3130	This is a very important issue we're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	3131	Im- most importantly, consumer confidence as surveyed by the reputable organization at the University of Michigan is at the highest since 1972.	1
ClaimBuster	3132	We've been remarkably successful, with the help of a Democratic Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	3133	India under a free society has been making some progress.	1
ClaimBuster	3134	And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	3135	Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort.	0
ClaimBuster	3136	When you're the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did.	0
ClaimBuster	3137	For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together.	1
ClaimBuster	3138	More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make.	1
ClaimBuster	3139	And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way that's good for them.	0
ClaimBuster	3140	I believe in freedom of choice.	0
ClaimBuster	3141	And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.	1
ClaimBuster	3142	You've got one more energy -- you've got one more question.	0
ClaimBuster	3143	There ought to be a standardized design.	0
ClaimBuster	3144	But -- and I say that about a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	3145	And so I say in conclusion, keep America's faith strong.	0
ClaimBuster	3146	Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.	0
ClaimBuster	3147	Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu.	0
ClaimBuster	3148	We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida.	1
ClaimBuster	3149	There are some changes that I would like to make.	0
ClaimBuster	3150	It's not Social Security plus, it's Social Security plus huge debt.	0
ClaimBuster	3151	Not only that, you named the day.	1
ClaimBuster	3152	But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU.	0
ClaimBuster	3153	Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?	0
ClaimBuster	3154	They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power.	0
ClaimBuster	3155	In fact, it was a Republican idea.	1
ClaimBuster	3156	If you create Saddam Hussein, over a 10-year period, using billions of dollars of US taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	3157	But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	3158	The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense.	0
ClaimBuster	3159	I would reach out to our allies in a way that this president hasn't.	0
ClaimBuster	3160	I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	3161	...and $500 billion over the next five.	1
ClaimBuster	3162	There are guys that couldn't get a job third shift in a Dairy Queen driving BMWs and Mercedes selling drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	3163	I will not let that happen.	0
ClaimBuster	3164	Well, we have a comparison that we can make.	0
ClaimBuster	3165	I've been trying so hard not to.	0
ClaimBuster	3166	Those are the people who in the 1980s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down.	1
ClaimBuster	3167	But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.	0
ClaimBuster	3168	And it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	3169	He and his running-mate didn't show up to vote when they could have got it going in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	3170	We're going to have regulatory -- we're gonna have litigation reform.	0
ClaimBuster	3171	The offshore drilling rights is a question that Governor Reagan raises often.	1
ClaimBuster	3172	Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	1
ClaimBuster	3173	It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.	0
ClaimBuster	3174	Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	3175	Fox the other day in New Hampshire, who's suffering from Parkinson's, and he wants us to do stem cell, embryonic stem cell.	1
ClaimBuster	3176	And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.	1
ClaimBuster	3177	Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.	0
ClaimBuster	3178	I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.	1
ClaimBuster	3179	I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	3180	Oh, I'm a pretty calm guy.	0
ClaimBuster	3181	It's sort of ad hoc, just whatever comes up, we'll deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	3182	And that is, I wouldn't join the International Criminal Court.	0
ClaimBuster	3183	And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	3184	In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	3185	We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.	1
ClaimBuster	3186	Now, when JFK said we're going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done.	1
ClaimBuster	3187	When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.	1
ClaimBuster	3188	I believe in its greatness.	0
ClaimBuster	3189	It was a bipartisan approach, but it's been rejected.	1
ClaimBuster	3190	Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	3191	It's good for small businesses, good for owners.	0
ClaimBuster	3192	And it isn't really higher prices, it's just, you are reducing the value of the money.	0
ClaimBuster	3193	The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.	1
ClaimBuster	3194	She said a lot of things that were false.	1
ClaimBuster	3195	We can get into a war by letting events get out of hand, as they have in the last three and a half years under the foreign policies of this Administration of Mr. Carter's, until we're faced each time with a crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	3196	That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls.	0
ClaimBuster	3197	Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends.	0
ClaimBuster	3198	They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	3199	These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	3200	I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.	1
ClaimBuster	3201	And I believe that we can together do things that are within the grasp of Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	3202	Uh I call that the people amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	3203	He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.	1
ClaimBuster	3204	Again I say, think of the Americans with Disabilities Act.	0
ClaimBuster	3205	Well let me make one thing clear.	0
ClaimBuster	3206	I think we still need affirmative action.	0
ClaimBuster	3207	Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	3208	That wasn't proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense.	1
ClaimBuster	3209	Strong families need a strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	3210	We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.	0
ClaimBuster	3211	Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	3212	In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops.	0
ClaimBuster	3213	We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.	1
ClaimBuster	3214	It's a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.	0
ClaimBuster	3215	We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline just as we did back in 1983 and we did it on a bipartisan basis.	0
ClaimBuster	3216	No, I'm saying our principal need now is to stabilize the tax base, which is the job base, and create a growing, dynamic base.	0
ClaimBuster	3217	And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet.	0
ClaimBuster	3218	I'm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here -- here with me.	0
ClaimBuster	3219	I know what it's like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times.	0
ClaimBuster	3220	I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.	0
ClaimBuster	3221	Why don't we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heavens free from war?	0
ClaimBuster	3222	The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy.	1
ClaimBuster	3223	I do not intend to spend one minute of one day thinking about re-election.	0
ClaimBuster	3224	And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999.	1
ClaimBuster	3225	And I believe we're all children of the same God.	0
ClaimBuster	3226	And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	3227	And I think that's a private matter.	0
ClaimBuster	3228	As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.	1
ClaimBuster	3229	And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	3230	But that in and of itself was a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	3231	And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.	0
ClaimBuster	3232	I was opposed to the war.	1
ClaimBuster	3233	I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.	0
ClaimBuster	3234	... have a good time, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	3235	And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think I'd be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood.	0
ClaimBuster	3236	On the third time we sent welfare reform to the president he signed it but announced he would change it next year, and the vice president said they were going to do something else through the line item veto which I've never understood, but that's sort of inside baseball.	1
ClaimBuster	3237	That's having a government from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	3238	In athletics, we know it.	0
ClaimBuster	3239	And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to the school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world they're going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you: I defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	3240	If you stop the drugs, nobody is going to use the drugs; so don't smoke, don't drink, don't use drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	3241	The education is a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	3242	Tax reform is relevant for old and young alike.	0
ClaimBuster	3243	With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.	0
ClaimBuster	3244	But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.	1
ClaimBuster	3245	That's not appropriate to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3246	But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.	0
ClaimBuster	3247	The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 211/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.	1
ClaimBuster	3248	I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	3249	But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was.	0
ClaimBuster	3250	One-third of the president's budget is at the president's discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime.	1
ClaimBuster	3251	So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.	1
ClaimBuster	3252	The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them.	0
ClaimBuster	3253	I'd also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if you've got a family problem.	0
ClaimBuster	3254	I would wind up -- I mean, it's the last question and I would mischaracterize it to try to make you happy.	0
ClaimBuster	3255	And she speaks English a lot better than I do.	0
ClaimBuster	3256	And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	3257	When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses.	1
ClaimBuster	3258	So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.	0
ClaimBuster	3259	But I want to go back to 1965.	0
ClaimBuster	3260	That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	3261	... we can't -- we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all.	0
ClaimBuster	3262	I'm not going to appoint a judge to the Court who's going to undo a constitutional right, whether it's the First Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment, or some other right that's given under our courts today -- under the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	3263	I wasn't the one that said 5.4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3264	Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	3265	This is a decision that the president of the United States must make.	0
ClaimBuster	3266	Question really is who do you want in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	3267	And it's a big fight.	0
ClaimBuster	3268	That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	3269	I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	3270	This is the private market.	1
ClaimBuster	3271	What we need to do is go after...	0
ClaimBuster	3272	I think it's a triumph.	0
ClaimBuster	3273	So here's what we do.	0
ClaimBuster	3274	You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there.	1
ClaimBuster	3275	You'll get your chance in a moment.	0
ClaimBuster	3276	And so, we made a proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	3277	For what purpose it was put in place, I can't imagine.	0
ClaimBuster	3278	There are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the inner city.	0
ClaimBuster	3279	Well I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba, a while ago.	1
ClaimBuster	3280	But when -- when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.	1
ClaimBuster	3281	Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less.	0
ClaimBuster	3282	Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it.	1
ClaimBuster	3283	Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	3284	When you√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢re a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars in taxpayer√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s money and you√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢re a mature individual and you make a mistake, then that was on our ticket.	0
ClaimBuster	3285	I would not work hard to support any of those.	0
ClaimBuster	3286	But there are many people who I admire in this country today.	0
ClaimBuster	3287	Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life.	0
ClaimBuster	3288	Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U.N. Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U.N.	1
ClaimBuster	3289	We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.	0
ClaimBuster	3290	So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and that's why we had to take action.	0
ClaimBuster	3291	That was the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3292	Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support.	0
ClaimBuster	3293	I don't want to have our military involved in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	3294	And so, we've got to introduce high technology into health care.	0
ClaimBuster	3295	And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce.	0
ClaimBuster	3296	And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.	0
ClaimBuster	3297	This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.	0
ClaimBuster	3298	I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	3299	That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.	0
ClaimBuster	3300	We're talking about drugs made right here in the United States of America that have American brand names on them and American bottles.	0
ClaimBuster	3301	Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?	0
ClaimBuster	3302	Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.	0
ClaimBuster	3303	I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years.	0
ClaimBuster	3304	With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families.	0
ClaimBuster	3305	But here's what I said.	0
ClaimBuster	3306	But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	3307	When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work.	1
ClaimBuster	3308	When I'm President of the United States, we're going to use the National Guard and whatever sources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America.	0
ClaimBuster	3309	And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	3310	We have in -- in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood president.	1
ClaimBuster	3311	I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955.	1
ClaimBuster	3312	And sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	3313	I hope we can succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	3314	And he's got a lot of experience, but so do I.	1
ClaimBuster	3315	Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do.	1
ClaimBuster	3316	I agree with her on one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	3317	I am answering your questions.	0
ClaimBuster	3318	In the case of the Helsinki agreement - it may have been a good agreement at the beginning, but we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out.	1
ClaimBuster	3319	And when it comes to South Korea, we've got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	3320	The basic problem with it, it doesn't balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	3321	It's what leadership is based on.	0
ClaimBuster	3322	So I think what was wrong -- I give credit where credit is due -- but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous.	1
ClaimBuster	3323	Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.	0
ClaimBuster	3324	I think they'll choose it, because it's a net plus of $5 billion to them.	1
ClaimBuster	3325	The right to vote is basic.	0
ClaimBuster	3326	Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	3327	But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.	0
ClaimBuster	3328	How do we prevent attacks?	0
ClaimBuster	3329	So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.	0
ClaimBuster	3330	Number two, seeing a -- a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us.	0
ClaimBuster	3331	He did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	3332	Social Security is in surplus $70 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	3333	My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	3334	A growing, expanding job base to generate the funds and the tax revenues to pay off the mess and rebuild America.	0
ClaimBuster	3335	We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	3336	No longer do we give an image of vitality.	0
ClaimBuster	3337	We had the slowest growth, about 2.5 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3338	Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	3339	We've lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	3340	In fact, he's done the opposite.	1
ClaimBuster	3341	Now, let me just go back with you very briefly.	0
ClaimBuster	3342	Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden.	1
ClaimBuster	3343	And -- and so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.	1
ClaimBuster	3344	He'd just said Jim Baker was going to be secretary of state and in the first debate he said no, now he's gonna be responsible for domestic economic policy.	1
ClaimBuster	3345	Senator Obama, I am not President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	3346	When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future.	0
ClaimBuster	3347	You take a look at all the programs you've advocated, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	3348	You can take a look at the op-ed...	0
ClaimBuster	3349	95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponent's plan for the first four or five years.	1
ClaimBuster	3350	And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	3351	And our state cares a lot about our children.	0
ClaimBuster	3352	It had to do with the discussion we had had the previous day on the overall question of reducing the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	3353	But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.	0
ClaimBuster	3354	Every 18-year-old can go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	3355	Last point I want to make, though.	0
ClaimBuster	3356	And she was in the hospital, and I went in to talk to her and tell her what I was thinking of doing.	1
ClaimBuster	3357	Our jobs are fleeing the country.	1
ClaimBuster	3358	We're not making those choices.	0
ClaimBuster	3359	Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different.	0
ClaimBuster	3360	So we can't ignore those lessons of history.	0
ClaimBuster	3361	I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.	1
ClaimBuster	3362	I've chuckled a few times at some of their comments.	1
ClaimBuster	3363	We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	3364	It'd be fine with me.	0
ClaimBuster	3365	First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated.	1
ClaimBuster	3366	And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	3367	They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.	0
ClaimBuster	3368	And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn't be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.	0
ClaimBuster	3369	And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.	0
ClaimBuster	3370	I thought it would be better for the country than it was.	0
ClaimBuster	3371	I'm talking about the one that was proposed to deal --	0
ClaimBuster	3372	There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age.	1
ClaimBuster	3373	But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns.	0
ClaimBuster	3374	I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	3375	And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat.	1
ClaimBuster	3376	Thirdly, spread what's called health savings accounts.	0
ClaimBuster	3377	But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right.	0
ClaimBuster	3378	So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	3379	We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	3380	Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery.	1
ClaimBuster	3381	How does he avoid conflict?	0
ClaimBuster	3382	And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade.	1
ClaimBuster	3383	After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us.	0
ClaimBuster	3384	Inflation is robbing us, as we've already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh - just a horrible mess.	0
ClaimBuster	3385	You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.	0
ClaimBuster	3386	And, as I say, we've had tough economic times, and it's exports that have saved us, exports that have built.	1
ClaimBuster	3387	Now with respect to a couple of things Senator McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Senator McCain keeps on making.	1
ClaimBuster	3388	That's one that I understand and certainly will carry out.	0
ClaimBuster	3389	The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed.	0
ClaimBuster	3390	A president sets the strategy and relies upon good military people to execute that strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	3391	I have indicated to General Brown that uh - the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised.	1
ClaimBuster	3392	I want to make more people like that woman, Lily Harden, so I've got a plan to do it, and it's just beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	3393	He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn't work at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	3394	But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	3395	He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin.	1
ClaimBuster	3396	But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.	0
ClaimBuster	3397	We have a budget deficit in the federal government, but we also have an investment, a jobs, an income deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	3398	Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas to come back and other countries to come back into the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	3399	But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.	0
ClaimBuster	3400	It's a matter of being tough.	0
ClaimBuster	3401	And you're entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us.	0
ClaimBuster	3402	It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.	0
ClaimBuster	3403	He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	3404	I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America.	1
ClaimBuster	3405	As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers.	1
ClaimBuster	3406	I think they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe.	0
ClaimBuster	3407	Then you get what you want, and shouldn't you?	0
ClaimBuster	3408	So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	3409	She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	3410	And unfortunately again I regret this administration has not seized them and embraced them.	0
ClaimBuster	3411	We have the highest foreign debt in history.	1
ClaimBuster	3412	Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	3413	And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.	1
ClaimBuster	3414	And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road.	0
ClaimBuster	3415	Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	3416	And we've probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more, because they've given up hope.	1
ClaimBuster	3417	There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant.	0
ClaimBuster	3418	Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map.	0
ClaimBuster	3419	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	3420	I'm caught in the middle on NAFTA.	1
ClaimBuster	3421	Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course.	0
ClaimBuster	3422	We have to have energy independence, so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we're developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	3423	We hadn't put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction.	0
ClaimBuster	3424	Let me tell you what your plan is.	0
ClaimBuster	3425	I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up.	1
ClaimBuster	3426	And we will do that.	0
ClaimBuster	3427	What he did in Moscow, that's fine.	0
ClaimBuster	3428	Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.	1
ClaimBuster	3429	And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.	1
ClaimBuster	3430	He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	3431	I was just endorsed by ICE.	1
ClaimBuster	3432	So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.	0
ClaimBuster	3433	I don't think the Fed ought to be put under the Executive Branch.	0
ClaimBuster	3434	I voted against that at the National Governors Association.	1
ClaimBuster	3435	He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	3436	We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations; he did have the 4th largest army.	1
ClaimBuster	3437	Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there's going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one.	0
ClaimBuster	3438	Well, I think I did a much better job.	0
ClaimBuster	3439	We cannot do it any longer, Lester.	0
ClaimBuster	3440	And one last point I want to make about Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	3441	But now we have a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	3442	I've done a lot of them, and I'll continue to do them as president.	1
ClaimBuster	3443	And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.	0
ClaimBuster	3444	I don't believe in liberal activist judges.	0
ClaimBuster	3445	Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America.	1
ClaimBuster	3446	I am going to help the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	3447	Wages and incomes have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	3448	We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that.	1
ClaimBuster	3449	And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	3450	The price of electricity is up.	1
ClaimBuster	3451	We've got to have a growing, expanding job base to give us a growing, expanding tax base.	0
ClaimBuster	3452	He's opposed every effort of every President to do so, and in the 4 years of his administration he's failed to do so.	1
ClaimBuster	3453	Veterans who've sacrificed for this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3454	You should know as much as possible about each of us.	0
ClaimBuster	3455	He'll tell you he's raised the money, and he has.	0
ClaimBuster	3456	But I will go out there and find men and women to interpret.	0
ClaimBuster	3457	They set a low standard of materialism.	0
ClaimBuster	3458	In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain.	1
ClaimBuster	3459	And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.	0
ClaimBuster	3460	We've got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites.	0
ClaimBuster	3461	Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	3462	We have to make it the number one priority.	0
ClaimBuster	3463	Now what greater admission is there, 16 months afterwards.	0
ClaimBuster	3464	I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.	0
ClaimBuster	3465	It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.	0
ClaimBuster	3466	My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today.	0
ClaimBuster	3467	I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	3468	And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.	0
ClaimBuster	3469	We can have enough clean energy to power every home.	1
ClaimBuster	3470	"They're not going to follow somebody who says, ""This is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time."""	0
ClaimBuster	3471	But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating.	0
ClaimBuster	3472	It's like having a blueprint for a house you never built.	0
ClaimBuster	3473	We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.	1
ClaimBuster	3474	Recognize -- I believe that Assad must go.	0
ClaimBuster	3475	What we need is good, strong leadership going in the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	3476	But let's sort of keep this out of politics because it's pretty dicey right now.	0
ClaimBuster	3477	223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.	1
ClaimBuster	3478	And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.	0
ClaimBuster	3479	But what I've also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities.	1
ClaimBuster	3480	I wasn't happy when we found out there wasn't weapons, and we've got an intelligence group together to figure out why.	1
ClaimBuster	3481	But if they do -- if they do, it's easy to fix.	0
ClaimBuster	3482	And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.	1
ClaimBuster	3483	We both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome.	0
ClaimBuster	3484	And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	3485	You talk about women and women's rights?	0
ClaimBuster	3486	I have a plan to put America back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	3487	If we had a disaster today, could they handle it?	0
ClaimBuster	3488	And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually.	1
ClaimBuster	3489	I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.	1
ClaimBuster	3490	And many of the things the President talked about, he turned over to the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	3491	How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf.	0
ClaimBuster	3492	Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.	1
ClaimBuster	3493	Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide.	1
ClaimBuster	3494	If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up.	0
ClaimBuster	3495	That's already offered in the private marketplace.	1
ClaimBuster	3496	I must remind him that we're at peace and during the period that he brags about unemployment being low, the United States was at war.	1
ClaimBuster	3497	We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	3498	I'm not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	3499	Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years.	0
ClaimBuster	3500	I think we've got a lot more work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3501	I did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	3502	I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that's about a billion dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	3503	"... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it."	0
ClaimBuster	3504	We do not have to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3505	The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedy's time, for example moved tremendously.	1
ClaimBuster	3506	It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.	0
ClaimBuster	3507	I've had the same test.	0
ClaimBuster	3508	We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.	0
ClaimBuster	3509	You know, I fell off a platform out in California, Chico, a while back.	1
ClaimBuster	3510	But let me just say to all of America: if you hate people, I don't want your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	3511	No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.	1
ClaimBuster	3512	I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	3513	Somebody who understands that there're real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms, or the single parents, the families or the seniors, or people with disabilities, whoever it may be.	0
ClaimBuster	3514	Look at the mess that we're in.	0
ClaimBuster	3515	How do you do it?	0
ClaimBuster	3516	Now, just back on this -- on this tax, you know, again, it's back to our first question here about rhetoric and record.	0
ClaimBuster	3517	It is -- it is a huge problem.	0
ClaimBuster	3518	You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3519	Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	3520	"They say, ""We feel like we're under attack from our own government."""	1
ClaimBuster	3521	I'm telling you, I will make it the -- I will make the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform bill the very first measure that I send to the Congress as president.	0
ClaimBuster	3522	These countries can't develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	3523	Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	3524	The question is who makes the decision.	0
ClaimBuster	3525	And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.	0
ClaimBuster	3526	We retained control as though we had sovereignty.	1
ClaimBuster	3527	We just had the election there.	1
ClaimBuster	3528	Because I was a senator with a Republican president.	1
ClaimBuster	3529	Barbara's sitting over here and I -- but what I have proposed, 10% cut, downsize the government, and we can get that done.	1
ClaimBuster	3530	And I'm sitting there and saying, well, who else could be around, you know?	0
ClaimBuster	3531	And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem.	0
ClaimBuster	3532	I am a graduate of the U.S.	1
ClaimBuster	3533	Bad health care at the most expensive price.	0
ClaimBuster	3534	It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.	0
ClaimBuster	3535	We need to expand our exports, and they're going very, very well, indeed.	0
ClaimBuster	3536	Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	3537	In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there.	1
ClaimBuster	3538	overlapping, aren't those the real costs?	0
ClaimBuster	3539	Let's take the example that the President cites.	0
ClaimBuster	3540	That's the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains.	0
ClaimBuster	3541	The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	3542	We have to stop the spending.	0
ClaimBuster	3543	And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...	0
ClaimBuster	3544	The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.	0
ClaimBuster	3545	I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system.	1
ClaimBuster	3546	I -- I don't know where John is getting his figures.	0
ClaimBuster	3547	Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	3548	The first -- the first -- the first -- and we kept our schools number one in the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	3549	I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining.	1
ClaimBuster	3550	Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.	0
ClaimBuster	3551	I think what it means to build consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	3552	And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	3553	You know, this man has no credibility on the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	3554	You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.	0
ClaimBuster	3555	I can't protect an Arkansas company, you notice there, Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	3556	It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone, to discount their sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	3557	And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism.	0
ClaimBuster	3558	So we talk about all these new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	3559	It would far surpass the numbers you mentioned.	1
ClaimBuster	3560	I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	0
ClaimBuster	3561	We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them.	1
ClaimBuster	3562	And most of the time, I learn it by asking her.	0
ClaimBuster	3563	The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.	1
ClaimBuster	3564	We're going to cut business taxes massively.	0
ClaimBuster	3565	So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs.	0
ClaimBuster	3566	And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies.	0
ClaimBuster	3567	I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3568	I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.	1
ClaimBuster	3569	And finally, number five, we've got to champion small business.	0
ClaimBuster	3570	We can't do it just in the schools.	0
ClaimBuster	3571	As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that.	0
ClaimBuster	3572	Religion has been a huge part of my life.	0
ClaimBuster	3573	We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.	1
ClaimBuster	3574	But again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman...	0
ClaimBuster	3575	And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	3576	I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority.	1
ClaimBuster	3577	And that's the way I've conducted myself as Governor of Texas and that's the way I'll conduct myself as President of the United States, should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	3578	Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions.	1
ClaimBuster	3579	No, I don't believe it's going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	3580	But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued.	0
ClaimBuster	3581	It goes back to the founding of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	3582	How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?	0
ClaimBuster	3583	We have the sources here.	0
ClaimBuster	3584	And you cannot keep both promises.	0
ClaimBuster	3585	You couldn't even have been a cardiologist because he had quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	3586	In the -- in the last women have lost 580,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	3587	We will reform our military.	0
ClaimBuster	3588	Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Senator Obama wants, if you're out there, my friend, and you've got employees, and you've got kids, if you don't get -- adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.	1
ClaimBuster	3589	The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.	1
ClaimBuster	3590	So I'll get rid of that.	0
ClaimBuster	3591	As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	3592	But any one that's here, we want to have more jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	3593	But in any event, I understand the problems.	0
ClaimBuster	3594	And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	3595	It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less.	1
ClaimBuster	3596	This is about American jobs and opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	3597	We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.	0
ClaimBuster	3598	I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate.	0
ClaimBuster	3599	For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	3600	And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	3601	But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.	0
ClaimBuster	3602	Now, there's more work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3603	That's been one of the hallmarks of my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	3604	I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another.	0
ClaimBuster	3605	And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.	1
ClaimBuster	3606	Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.	1
ClaimBuster	3607	And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	3608	Mine does not grow the government, it does not invest, have government invest.	0
ClaimBuster	3609	Let's give the money directly to students.	0
ClaimBuster	3610	What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.	0
ClaimBuster	3611	Our funding for recovery is up, recovering the addicts.	1
ClaimBuster	3612	Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3613	But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there.	0
ClaimBuster	3614	But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan's former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci.	1
ClaimBuster	3615	It's being used in 17 states right now.	1
ClaimBuster	3616	I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem.	1
ClaimBuster	3617	I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency.	1
ClaimBuster	3618	Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments.	1
ClaimBuster	3619	And so one of the things that we've been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that's noncorrupt, that's transparent.	1
ClaimBuster	3620	And those are the stakes.	0
ClaimBuster	3621	For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	3622	They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.	1
ClaimBuster	3623	But I think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993.	1
ClaimBuster	3624	The American people asked me to get into it.	1
ClaimBuster	3625	And I ask for your support on November 8th.	0
ClaimBuster	3626	Your responsibility is to show up on November the 5th.	0
ClaimBuster	3627	Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year.	0
ClaimBuster	3628	If they did it by surprise...	0
ClaimBuster	3629	Found a boy -- excuse me, but this gives the flavor -- a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows.	1
ClaimBuster	3630	In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada.	1
ClaimBuster	3631	Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.	0
ClaimBuster	3632	My plan says that we want to raise marginal incomes on family incomes above $200,000 from 31 to 36 percent, that we want to ask foreign corporations simply to pay the same percentage of taxes on their income that American corporations play (sic) in America, that we want to use that money to provide over $100 billion in tax cuts for investment in new plant and equipment, for small business, for new technologies, and for middle class tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	3633	Uh - that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program.	0
ClaimBuster	3634	I think it's the people's money.	0
ClaimBuster	3635	This is money out of that family's pocket.	0
ClaimBuster	3636	I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	3637	I'm opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958.	1
ClaimBuster	3638	It's put a lot of people out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	3639	By the way, I don't like to have the federal government start pushing its weight deeper and deeper into our schools.	0
ClaimBuster	3640	Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue.	1
ClaimBuster	3641	There√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3642	"So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, ""Fix it for us."""	0
ClaimBuster	3643	China should go into North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	3644	When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	3645	And all you hear about is how bad things are.	0
ClaimBuster	3646	They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other.	1
ClaimBuster	3647	And we have to change in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3648	I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society we're in, so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefit-for a-work that will be productive and he won't have to go on one of these many programs that the liberal-talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	3649	In fact, the inspector general of the Justice Department found that John Ashcroft had twice applied it in ways that were inappropriate.	1
ClaimBuster	3650	As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.	0
ClaimBuster	3651	All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.	0
ClaimBuster	3652	I'm going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	3653	There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.	0
ClaimBuster	3654	And a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place.	0
ClaimBuster	3655	So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.	0
ClaimBuster	3656	I've admitted it when I make a mistake, but then I go on and help, try to solve the problems.	0
ClaimBuster	3657	But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	3658	I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.	0
ClaimBuster	3659	I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think you're going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected, who have lots of expertise.	0
ClaimBuster	3660	And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.	0
ClaimBuster	3661	"So what's the message going to be: ""Please join us in Iraq."	0
ClaimBuster	3662	"He said, ""I don't know."	1
ClaimBuster	3663	Number 2, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already.	0
ClaimBuster	3664	But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.	0
ClaimBuster	3665	The other party gives them lip service.	0
ClaimBuster	3666	I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.	0
ClaimBuster	3667	We're increasing defense reasonably -- not too much, but we are increasing defense some -- because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason.	1
ClaimBuster	3668	But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights.	0
ClaimBuster	3669	We need to help people who are between jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	3670	Now, he talks about Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	3671	I care a lot about this.	0
ClaimBuster	3672	But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class.	1
ClaimBuster	3673	The president always has the right, and always has had the right, for preemptive strike.	1
ClaimBuster	3674	Secondly, if you're a family of four making $50,000 in Massachusetts, you get a 50% tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	3675	I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.	0
ClaimBuster	3676	It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.	0
ClaimBuster	3677	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.	1
ClaimBuster	3678	I will deal with them from day 1.	0
ClaimBuster	3679	He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator.	1
ClaimBuster	3680	But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	3681	And you take a look at the people of Haiti.	0
ClaimBuster	3682	And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?	0
ClaimBuster	3683	We're using the military more now in terms of interdiction.	1
ClaimBuster	3684	But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.	0
ClaimBuster	3685	Respect the First Amendment, but I will do something to help you raise your kids without that garbage.	0
ClaimBuster	3686	I hear this talk about a blank check.	0
ClaimBuster	3687	And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we don't have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	3688	Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	3689	Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today.	1
ClaimBuster	3690	Now, those are the details as we have them.	0
ClaimBuster	3691	Oh, you didn't delete them?	0
ClaimBuster	3692	We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together.	0
ClaimBuster	3693	Now, our real problem here is they both have plans that will not work.	0
ClaimBuster	3694	And it is unfortunate, it is a difficult area, no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	3695	We became grandparents a year-and-a-half ago.	1
ClaimBuster	3696	And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.	1
ClaimBuster	3697	I know how to save billions.	0
ClaimBuster	3698	When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other .5 percent, we're looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats.	1
ClaimBuster	3699	The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.	1
ClaimBuster	3700	I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.	0
ClaimBuster	3701	The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.	1
ClaimBuster	3702	Isn't providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn't it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that's part of the American dream?	0
ClaimBuster	3703	Let's say, this isn't Democrat or Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	3704	One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for?	0
ClaimBuster	3705	So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did.	0
ClaimBuster	3706	Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	3707	Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue.	1
ClaimBuster	3708	This is a very important moment in the history of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	3709	We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war.	0
ClaimBuster	3710	But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	3711	Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.	1
ClaimBuster	3712	As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve.	0
ClaimBuster	3713	Thank you very, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	3714	It used to be the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	3715	I think it should stay in a lockbox, and I'll tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	3716	So what I've said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change.	1
ClaimBuster	3717	And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.	0
ClaimBuster	3718	I agree with the general statement Mr. Bush made.	0
ClaimBuster	3719	China is growing at 7 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	3720	I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people.	1
ClaimBuster	3721	To giving every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as Senator Obama's plan calls for.	1
ClaimBuster	3722	Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	3723	It will probably have to be done by a commission.	0
ClaimBuster	3724	But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	3725	And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.	0
ClaimBuster	3726	That's why we have the great migration.	0
ClaimBuster	3727	We now have 2500 hospices.	1
ClaimBuster	3728	That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.	0
ClaimBuster	3729	There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.	0
ClaimBuster	3730	We need to have walk-in clinics.	0
ClaimBuster	3731	Someone called them something else.	0
ClaimBuster	3732	A lot of things happened which maybe shouldn't have happened.	0
ClaimBuster	3733	Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.	1
ClaimBuster	3734	If you don't want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you don't have do.	0
ClaimBuster	3735	And this is a safer country.	0
ClaimBuster	3736	So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.	1
ClaimBuster	3737	But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	3738	Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldn't eat except for them.	1
ClaimBuster	3739	And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.	0
ClaimBuster	3740	My priority is going to be the health of our citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	3741	Mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom, and look at the dramatic changes around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3742	You own this country but you have no voice in it the way it's organized now, and if you want to have a high risk experience, comparable to bungee jumping, go into Congress some time when they're working on this kind of legislation, when the lobbyists are running up and down the halls.	0
ClaimBuster	3743	In fact, this week we'll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week.	1
ClaimBuster	3744	We have huge difference between us on this question.	0
ClaimBuster	3745	The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force.	0
ClaimBuster	3746	We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	3747	Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	3748	And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.	0
ClaimBuster	3749	But the reason for that is obvious.	0
ClaimBuster	3750	So there are some positive ways we can work on this.	0
ClaimBuster	3751	I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it.	1
ClaimBuster	3752	It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.	0
ClaimBuster	3753	And today there's a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy.	1
ClaimBuster	3754	That's what we have here.	0
ClaimBuster	3755	I don't think that's the role of the president.	0
ClaimBuster	3756	I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them, see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes.	0
ClaimBuster	3757	Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress.	0
ClaimBuster	3758	Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.	1
ClaimBuster	3759	It says that you can't gag a doctor, doctor can advise you.	0
ClaimBuster	3760	Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	3761	That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out.	0
ClaimBuster	3762	But I will be a tolerant person.	0
ClaimBuster	3763	But we need much more than wind and solar.	0
ClaimBuster	3764	I'm sure every state in the union has got them.	1
ClaimBuster	3765	That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit answer...	0
ClaimBuster	3766	Compared to four years ago, we're clearly better off.	0
ClaimBuster	3767	And you know how you can trust me about that?	0
ClaimBuster	3768	We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.	1
ClaimBuster	3769	I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group.	1
ClaimBuster	3770	And, you know, there's always a reason for everything.	0
ClaimBuster	3771	But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?	0
ClaimBuster	3772	There are only three left.	1
ClaimBuster	3773	Race remains a significant challenge in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	3774	And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it's a gateway.	0
ClaimBuster	3775	He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account.	0
ClaimBuster	3776	It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	3777	Is there an equal time rule tonight?	0
ClaimBuster	3778	Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues.	0
ClaimBuster	3779	But the only uh - thing I uh - have pointed out was, what I've just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldn't be forced to release a person who was obviously guilty just because of a - of a small technicality in the law.	0
ClaimBuster	3780	It just takes good, strong leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	3781	That's kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place.	0
ClaimBuster	3782	And you hear all the bad stuff that's happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind.	0
ClaimBuster	3783	I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.	0
ClaimBuster	3784	And that's going to be my job.	0
ClaimBuster	3785	Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.	0
ClaimBuster	3786	Well, I think it's pretty liberal, I'll put that label on it.	0
ClaimBuster	3787	You tried it last time you ran.	1
ClaimBuster	3788	In this case when you murder somebody it's hate, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	3789	You have a raging debate about those plans.	0
ClaimBuster	3790	How strong are we going to be?	0
ClaimBuster	3791	We're also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school.	0
ClaimBuster	3792	They don't like it when there's an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people.	0
ClaimBuster	3793	The governor used the phrase phony numbers, but if you look at the plan and add the numbers up, these numbers are correct.	1
ClaimBuster	3794	But I would certainly not do first strike.	0
ClaimBuster	3795	And in 1985, he flew back from the West Coast to cut that COLA.	1
ClaimBuster	3796	There's a lot of pressures.	0
ClaimBuster	3797	Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.	0
ClaimBuster	3798	I'll lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	3799	Two-thirds of the country was a no-fly zone when we started this war.	1
ClaimBuster	3800	And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	3801	More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.	1
ClaimBuster	3802	It's not going to be like the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	3803	Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.	1
ClaimBuster	3804	Let me just say, Jim, you haven't heard the governor deny these numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	3805	I believe I know what this country ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	3806	Let me begin by saying that my health-care plan is not what the president described.	0
ClaimBuster	3807	It's gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society.	1
ClaimBuster	3808	I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.	0
ClaimBuster	3809	Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I.	0
ClaimBuster	3810	I've been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other people's points of view.	0
ClaimBuster	3811	Would he have bombed Iran?	0
ClaimBuster	3812	One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.	1
ClaimBuster	3813	Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.	0
ClaimBuster	3814	But I would not want anyone to elect me uh - president of the United States - or vote for me - under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected.	0
ClaimBuster	3815	Well, first of all, I admire Senator Kerry's service to our country.	0
ClaimBuster	3816	We cannot just say law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	3817	Why didn't she do something about it?	0
ClaimBuster	3818	He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like.	0
ClaimBuster	3819	So we can fight this war, and we can win this war.	0
ClaimBuster	3820	I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he's sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn't believe in checks and balances, and I told him that.	0
ClaimBuster	3821	You know, America's best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	3822	But all I'm suggesting is let's not be na√É∆í√Ç¬Øve in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid.	0
ClaimBuster	3823	President Clinton did the same thing, because we have an obligation to protect you.	0
ClaimBuster	3824	So I say this is very simple.	0
ClaimBuster	3825	That's what it's meant to do.	0
ClaimBuster	3826	Sam Raybum had a great expression on this.	0
ClaimBuster	3827	And that's my biggest concern about my opponent.	0
ClaimBuster	3828	for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.	0
ClaimBuster	3829	I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	3830	Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus.	0
ClaimBuster	3831	The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan.	0
ClaimBuster	3832	So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.	0
ClaimBuster	3833	Just today I met with the presidents and the vice presidents of the Willow Run union here, near here.	1
ClaimBuster	3834	You're going to lose some deductions, and you can't buy the sales pitch.	0
ClaimBuster	3835	I'm convinced we'll do it.	0
ClaimBuster	3836	I suggest you pick a person who's successfully managed money.	0
ClaimBuster	3837	It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3838	Laos is moving in that direction.	1
ClaimBuster	3839	And these are the things you have to think through.	0
ClaimBuster	3840	We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years.	1
ClaimBuster	3841	Those would all, could all be challenged by men.	0
ClaimBuster	3842	The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place.	0
ClaimBuster	3843	Well obviously my views are a little different.	0
ClaimBuster	3844	Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if you're going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger.	1
ClaimBuster	3845	And I grew up learning how to respect those views.	0
ClaimBuster	3846	I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America -- you know, people who've lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children.	1
ClaimBuster	3847	And we want to encourage that.	0
ClaimBuster	3848	We have to turn around -- most schools are excellent, but we have to make sure that all of them are.	0
ClaimBuster	3849	And I don't hold it against him that he said grave threat.	0
ClaimBuster	3850	But I feel very strongly about that.	0
ClaimBuster	3851	And I believe I can.	0
ClaimBuster	3852	I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America.	0
ClaimBuster	3853	I'm not going to cut her benefits or support any proposal that would.	0
ClaimBuster	3854	So there are differences but that's about the main area where I think we have a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	3855	But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.	0
ClaimBuster	3856	And I want the states to meet their responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	3857	like a driver's license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles --	0
ClaimBuster	3858	Could we do another round on it?	0
ClaimBuster	3859	I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	3860	So let's look at our record.	0
ClaimBuster	3861	He says, well, he's going to raise the taxes on the rich -- that's what he said -- the top two brackets.	1
ClaimBuster	3862	If you make bad investments, that's too bad.	0
ClaimBuster	3863	I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.	1
ClaimBuster	3864	Doctors don't dare to deliver babies sometimes because they're afraid that somebody's going to sue them.	0
ClaimBuster	3865	One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.	0
ClaimBuster	3866	There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.	0
ClaimBuster	3867	I think this is the right strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	3868	But I will say as a Democrat, I was a real piker, Mr. President.	1
ClaimBuster	3869	A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the -- the world reject these -- these terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	3870	And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.	1
ClaimBuster	3871	This is what the families of MIAs want.	0
ClaimBuster	3872	So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	3873	It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed.	1
ClaimBuster	3874	Under my tax plan that he continues to criticize, I set one-third.	1
ClaimBuster	3875	Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you're 100.	0
ClaimBuster	3876	But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obama's set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region.	1
ClaimBuster	3877	And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?	0
ClaimBuster	3878	And the policy in Central America, regrettably, has failed because the Congress has been unwilling to support those who have been fighting for freedom.	1
ClaimBuster	3879	You've got to have the best intelligence in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3880	So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	3881	I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position.	1
ClaimBuster	3882	Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.	1
ClaimBuster	3883	Democratic woman up there -- taking the lead in this.	0
ClaimBuster	3884	There is no way that the recovery is even across the country, just as in the depths of the recession, there were some parts of the country that were worse off, but some that didn't even feel the pain of the recession.	0
ClaimBuster	3885	That is the way it will stay.	0
ClaimBuster	3886	Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.	1
ClaimBuster	3887	Let me just tell you who the jury is.	0
ClaimBuster	3888	I've shown the American people I know how to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	3889	But I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet.	0
ClaimBuster	3890	Members of the clergy who have done the same.	0
ClaimBuster	3891	What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	3892	"You said, ""Look, I'm going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone."""	1
ClaimBuster	3893	I'm not discussing Whitewater now.	0
ClaimBuster	3894	Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years.	1
ClaimBuster	3895	Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.	1
ClaimBuster	3896	What things would I cut from spending?	0
ClaimBuster	3897	And yet the cash register's empty and it used to have our money, the taxpayers' money, in it, and we didn't get the results.	0
ClaimBuster	3898	I know a lot about that.	1
ClaimBuster	3899	Nikki, that's a question that's been raised by a lot of people around the country.	1
ClaimBuster	3900	And all of us are in this fight together, all of us care.	0
ClaimBuster	3901	One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces.	0
ClaimBuster	3902	Now that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China.	1
ClaimBuster	3903	I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.	0
ClaimBuster	3904	But we'd like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life.	0
ClaimBuster	3905	Let me go back to the main point, Sandy.	0
ClaimBuster	3906	It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.	1
ClaimBuster	3907	So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3908	We're well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don't run her down in order to build her up.	0
ClaimBuster	3909	He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term.	1
ClaimBuster	3910	The entire press corps has looked at it.	1
ClaimBuster	3911	I will look at it at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	3912	There's a great young group, Lead or Leave, college students, young people, who don't want us to spend their money.	1
ClaimBuster	3913	And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it.	0
ClaimBuster	3914	That is absolutely not true.	0
ClaimBuster	3915	But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.	0
ClaimBuster	3916	He went to one meeting, and then we heard that he was stepping down.	1
ClaimBuster	3917	But Jesse Jackson is an independent person.	0
ClaimBuster	3918	We heard the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	3919	I think people understand what she's saying.	0
ClaimBuster	3920	We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.	0
ClaimBuster	3921	I won't support judges like that.	0
ClaimBuster	3922	But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.	1
ClaimBuster	3923	And I believe that we can bind our wounds.	0
ClaimBuster	3924	We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.	0
ClaimBuster	3925	You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	3926	But we're lawyers, I like lawyers.	1
ClaimBuster	3927	Costs will continue to spiral.	0
ClaimBuster	3928	The feelings are very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	3929	And eleven of 'em have been overridden.	1
ClaimBuster	3930	We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies- -more than we're going to lose in defense -- if we target it.	0
ClaimBuster	3931	And I know how to work with them.	0
ClaimBuster	3932	Now, I want to build the wall.	0
ClaimBuster	3933	But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.	1
ClaimBuster	3934	There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us.	1
ClaimBuster	3935	I know that Mr. Mondale, in the past, has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves, and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly.	1
ClaimBuster	3936	About uh - late October of 1975, I asked the then Secretary of Defense, Mr. Schlesinger, to tell me what had to be done if we were going to reduce the defense budget by uh - three to five billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	3937	It also means we're helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets.	1
ClaimBuster	3938	And the good thing about this is they'll be able to go across America.	0
ClaimBuster	3939	Well, it's pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion?	0
ClaimBuster	3940	I will say this about Hillary.	0
ClaimBuster	3941	And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.	1
ClaimBuster	3942	I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn't blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	3943	For a belief that law must be based on a higher law.	0
ClaimBuster	3944	And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	3945	There's been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	3946	You have a lot of it.	0
ClaimBuster	3947	And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?	0
ClaimBuster	3948	And, John, I -- you're absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say.	0
ClaimBuster	3949	I'd have confidence in him.	0
ClaimBuster	3950	I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that.	0
ClaimBuster	3951	I don't think they'll look at us with envy.	0
ClaimBuster	3952	That's why I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal.	1
ClaimBuster	3953	You got a lot of women running for office.	0
ClaimBuster	3954	And we're struggling with that today.	0
ClaimBuster	3955	We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	3956	Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now.	1
ClaimBuster	3957	If you all want the enterprise zones, why don't we pass the dang thing and do it, right?	0
ClaimBuster	3958	And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	3959	Raise your hand if you're in managed care plan.	0
ClaimBuster	3960	All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it.	0
ClaimBuster	3961	But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.	1
ClaimBuster	3962	What's the net result of this?	0
ClaimBuster	3963	At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	3964	And I hope that will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	3965	But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.	0
ClaimBuster	3966	If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition.	1
ClaimBuster	3967	When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.	0
ClaimBuster	3968	I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.	1
ClaimBuster	3969	There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often.	1
ClaimBuster	3970	And the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do?	0
ClaimBuster	3971	And we kicked this man out of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	3972	I don't want the American people to be confused.	0
ClaimBuster	3973	It was principled, and it was strategic.	0
ClaimBuster	3974	We're down 35,000 jobs in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	3975	And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices.	0
ClaimBuster	3976	Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America.	1
ClaimBuster	3977	You've got stop-loss policies, so people can't get out when they were supposed to.	0
ClaimBuster	3978	Couple of service men here.	1
ClaimBuster	3979	Now the present Administration - the President - has said - never indicated what he thought of the 1954 decision.	1
ClaimBuster	3980	But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	3981	This goes on night and day.	0
ClaimBuster	3982	And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors' conference.	1
ClaimBuster	3983	And I may have to make those tough decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	3984	But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.	0
ClaimBuster	3985	I guess the Vice President two or three times, said I was coming from the left.	1
ClaimBuster	3986	We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years.	1
ClaimBuster	3987	It's a great thing for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	3988	The Congress is doing a better job of it.	0
ClaimBuster	3989	There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position.	0
ClaimBuster	3990	Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do.	0
ClaimBuster	3991	And that's what we've done.	0
ClaimBuster	3992	It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more.	0
ClaimBuster	3993	They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power, aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we knew it.	0
ClaimBuster	3994	It is a school full of so-called at-risk children.	1
ClaimBuster	3995	This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	3996	And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	3997	Well, I guess some may be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	3998	They will not let them see the written instructions given to Ambassador Glaspie.	0
ClaimBuster	3999	So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.	0
ClaimBuster	4000	But it is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	4001	"And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, ""view,"" on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government."	1
ClaimBuster	4002	It's been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time.	1
ClaimBuster	4003	We may think that you deal with them in different ways.	0
ClaimBuster	4004	And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders.	1
ClaimBuster	4005	Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	4006	The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.	0
ClaimBuster	4007	I'm going to be able to balance the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	4008	So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.	0
ClaimBuster	4009	In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.	1
ClaimBuster	4010	I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	4011	When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver.	1
ClaimBuster	4012	We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	4013	So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.	1
ClaimBuster	4014	And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling.	0
ClaimBuster	4015	And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	4016	Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.	1
ClaimBuster	4017	You must have mandatory testing.	0
ClaimBuster	4018	All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	4019	We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one.	0
ClaimBuster	4020	There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee.	1
ClaimBuster	4021	I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again.	0
ClaimBuster	4022	Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help.	0
ClaimBuster	4023	The all- volunteer army works.	0
ClaimBuster	4024	It's either unfair for some or unfair for all.	0
ClaimBuster	4025	When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped.	1
ClaimBuster	4026	The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	1
ClaimBuster	4027	For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees.	1
ClaimBuster	4028	Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code?	0
ClaimBuster	4029	But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.	0
ClaimBuster	4030	There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending.	1
ClaimBuster	4031	We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	4032	But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.	0
ClaimBuster	4033	And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.	1
ClaimBuster	4034	It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	4035	But I believe -- we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a -- as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	4036	But I don't believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing - has identified itself with that change.	0
ClaimBuster	4037	So I think he's a bit taller than I am.	0
ClaimBuster	4038	I'm much more optimistic about this country than some.	0
ClaimBuster	4039	"We said, ""All right, if that's what you want to do.''"	0
ClaimBuster	4040	I don't want the government financing congressional elections.	0
ClaimBuster	4041	I've stood up and told the American people that I think it's a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I've told you what I think should be done.	0
ClaimBuster	4042	The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.	1
ClaimBuster	4043	No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.	1
ClaimBuster	4044	President Clinton opposes term limits, President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	4045	I think bipartisanship is a national asset.	0
ClaimBuster	4046	We could have gained if they did it by surprise.	0
ClaimBuster	4047	But we have got to reform government.	0
ClaimBuster	4048	And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.	1
ClaimBuster	4049	We've run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined.	1
ClaimBuster	4050	It sounds like the vice president√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s not right very many times tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	4051	He says on the one hand I am for it and on the other hand I may be against it.	1
ClaimBuster	4052	I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	4053	"And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president."""	1
ClaimBuster	4054	You have to gut it out, issue by issue by issue.	0
ClaimBuster	4055	But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.	0
ClaimBuster	4056	And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.	1
ClaimBuster	4057	So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	4058	These appointments are for life.	0
ClaimBuster	4059	You know my opinion on North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	4060	In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees.	1
ClaimBuster	4061	The president wants to do well.	0
ClaimBuster	4062	We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is.	0
ClaimBuster	4063	I believe in strict constructionists.	0
ClaimBuster	4064	And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission.	0
ClaimBuster	4065	We need to make sure our seniors get the promise made.	0
ClaimBuster	4066	You all know me, and we've held it back a little.	0
ClaimBuster	4067	Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.	1
ClaimBuster	4068	Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions.	1
ClaimBuster	4069	We sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it.	0
ClaimBuster	4070	The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready.	0
ClaimBuster	4071	I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war.	0
ClaimBuster	4072	"And they looked me in the eye and said, ""Yes, sir, Mr."	1
ClaimBuster	4073	The auto emissions - uh - it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh - heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified.	1
ClaimBuster	4074	But I have lived the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	4075	And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Senator Clinton not too long ago.	1
ClaimBuster	4076	That's exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern.	1
ClaimBuster	4077	It's the only reason to be for it.	0
ClaimBuster	4078	You're cutting back on maintenance and equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	4079	Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.	1
ClaimBuster	4080	That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.	1
ClaimBuster	4081	So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity, and bring them in the American system.	0
ClaimBuster	4082	The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	4083	And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40.	1
ClaimBuster	4084	Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.	1
ClaimBuster	4085	Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.	0
ClaimBuster	4086	The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	4087	Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed.	0
ClaimBuster	4088	Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	4089	There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.	1
ClaimBuster	4090	Now we can talk about Putin.	0
ClaimBuster	4091	We have devoted ourselves to our children and now our nearly one-and-a-half-year-old grandson.	1
ClaimBuster	4092	Devastated states like California and others.	0
ClaimBuster	4093	But as governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end.	0
ClaimBuster	4094	I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.	0
ClaimBuster	4095	And the fact that you're going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we've worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future.	1
ClaimBuster	4096	That was the right place.	0
ClaimBuster	4097	When the Republican platform says that from here on out, we're going to have a religious test for judges before they're selected for the Federal court, and then Jerry Falwell announces that that means they get at least two Justices of the Supreme Court, I think that's an abuse of faith in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	4098	I think we've seen a deterioration of values.	0
ClaimBuster	4099	And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years.	1
ClaimBuster	4100	And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.	1
ClaimBuster	4101	And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse.	0
ClaimBuster	4102	We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.	1
ClaimBuster	4103	With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office.	1
ClaimBuster	4104	When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.	0
ClaimBuster	4105	Governor Clinton says $200,000 but he also says he wants to raise $150 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	4106	The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	4107	Pam, what the president didn't tell you is all his tax cuts expire the year 2000, but these increases go on forever.	1
ClaimBuster	4108	And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities.	0
ClaimBuster	4109	These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.	0
ClaimBuster	4110	I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.	0
ClaimBuster	4111	We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up.	0
ClaimBuster	4112	We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border.	0
ClaimBuster	4113	Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.	1
ClaimBuster	4114	I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you'll see that we need new leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	4115	The matter of Somoza -- no, I never defended Somoza.	1
ClaimBuster	4116	The governor mentioned it earlier.	1
ClaimBuster	4117	And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.	0
ClaimBuster	4118	You were trying to defend your cut which was not a cut either, Reduction in the growth of spending.	0
ClaimBuster	4119	Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies.	1
ClaimBuster	4120	Some schools aren't even safe.	1
ClaimBuster	4121	Again, we've got plans lying all over the place in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	4122	Let me make my position cl ear.	0
ClaimBuster	4123	My grandmother died three days before I was elected president.	1
ClaimBuster	4124	I have a tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	4125	Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.	1
ClaimBuster	4126	Maybe we will talk about some more before it's over.	0
ClaimBuster	4127	But we are there, and I think this insurance policy is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	4128	I have no businesses there.	1
ClaimBuster	4129	In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4130	Well, they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds.	0
ClaimBuster	4131	But, of course, if you're a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney's talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	4132	And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire.	0
ClaimBuster	4133	I don't think we should have that kind of a program.	0
ClaimBuster	4134	And I look very, very much forward to doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	4135	You've got to go to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	4136	This is facts -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	4137	I first want to say the President didn't quite give you all of the stuff on the quotas, because the Justice Department had what we called the Piscataway case up in New Jersey.	1
ClaimBuster	4138	And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided	0
ClaimBuster	4139	I would like to have one in this race, come to think of it, but I don't get one.	0
ClaimBuster	4140	I think it's uh - also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh - added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	4141	Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback.	0
ClaimBuster	4142	And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	4143	Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they're upper income people?	0
ClaimBuster	4144	Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.	0
ClaimBuster	4145	And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	4146	Why do we have to do it?	0
ClaimBuster	4147	I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that won't teach, we need to free the parents.	0
ClaimBuster	4148	I don't believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side.	0
ClaimBuster	4149	But I just know how this world works, and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. president.	0
ClaimBuster	4150	It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy - to stop the waste of energy - and, secondly, to produce more American energy.	0
ClaimBuster	4151	I don't know, I'm not questioning anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	4152	And so I think that we're on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	4153	Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if it's all we have, it's not going to solve the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	4154	And yes, we've got too many taxes on the American people and we're spending too much.	1
ClaimBuster	4155	But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	4156	It doubles about every -- every five or so years.	1
ClaimBuster	4157	I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.	0
ClaimBuster	4158	And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.	1
ClaimBuster	4159	So if we are going to be serious about this issue, we've got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on.	0
ClaimBuster	4160	Now, what can I bring to that challenge?	0
ClaimBuster	4161	These are American citizens, we care deeply about them.	0
ClaimBuster	4162	We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.	0
ClaimBuster	4163	I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.	0
ClaimBuster	4164	When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.	1
ClaimBuster	4165	He's been traveling in some other country.	1
ClaimBuster	4166	What I said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say, which is, if Pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin Laden and take him out, then we should.	1
ClaimBuster	4167	I will knock the hell out of ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	4168	Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	4169	Because under the last four years, they've been buried.	1
ClaimBuster	4170	It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here.	1
ClaimBuster	4171	I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still.	0
ClaimBuster	4172	No, I don't think there is.	0
ClaimBuster	4173	I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps.	0
ClaimBuster	4174	His political opposition is being put in jail.	1
ClaimBuster	4175	These are places where people can get primary care.	1
ClaimBuster	4176	But I've got a better idea.	0
ClaimBuster	4177	And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	4178	But we also have to take demand seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	4179	And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick.	0
ClaimBuster	4180	And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan?	0
ClaimBuster	4181	And there is no system.	0
ClaimBuster	4182	The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.	1
ClaimBuster	4183	We have to work more closely with our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	4184	Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.	0
ClaimBuster	4185	Free trade with Colombia is something that's a no-brainer.	0
ClaimBuster	4186	And I was proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	4187	I've reached the conclusion, too, based on the reports that have been made, that they may be cheating.	0
ClaimBuster	4188	We need to invest and grow, and that's what I want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	4189	They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs -- those who sell exports.	1
ClaimBuster	4190	And I said, well, I'll tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	4191	I think the American people are ready for action.	0
ClaimBuster	4192	I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.	1
ClaimBuster	4193	One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it.	0
ClaimBuster	4194	And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay.	0
ClaimBuster	4195	Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.	1
ClaimBuster	4196	Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions.	1
ClaimBuster	4197	You all just heard my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	4198	I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn't going to take place to begin with.	0
ClaimBuster	4199	In the old days we'd see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not.	0
ClaimBuster	4200	We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her.	0
ClaimBuster	4201	War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.	0
ClaimBuster	4202	All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.	0
ClaimBuster	4203	I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together.	1
ClaimBuster	4204	But here again, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	0
ClaimBuster	4205	We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well.	0
ClaimBuster	4206	And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	4207	They have to make sure that they're cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	4208	We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.	1
ClaimBuster	4209	All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	4210	That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years.	1
ClaimBuster	4211	One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	4212	I want to get to Medicare in a second.	0
ClaimBuster	4213	He claims it will be out of Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	4214	If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh - to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage.	1
ClaimBuster	4215	The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium.	1
ClaimBuster	4216	Number 3, if the people really have a mind to change, they can.	0
ClaimBuster	4217	I love the optimism in that painting, because that's how I feel about America.	0
ClaimBuster	4218	I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law.	0
ClaimBuster	4219	He hasn't had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out.	1
ClaimBuster	4220	We're becoming more and more of a melting pot.	0
ClaimBuster	4221	Well, if it's in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are -- our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened.	0
ClaimBuster	4222	Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade.	1
ClaimBuster	4223	My opponent just said something amazing.	0
ClaimBuster	4224	It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending.	1
ClaimBuster	4225	Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.	1
ClaimBuster	4226	Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question.	1
ClaimBuster	4227	They don't want to see protectionism.	0
ClaimBuster	4228	So it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.	0
ClaimBuster	4229	We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.	0
ClaimBuster	4230	I don't think the American people are getting their money's worth from the majority party that run this Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	4231	The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice.	1
ClaimBuster	4232	It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	4233	I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America.	0
ClaimBuster	4234	And that's what I did, sir.	1
ClaimBuster	4235	I believe in building safe zones.	0
ClaimBuster	4236	He is for full public financing of Congressional elections.	1
ClaimBuster	4237	But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.	0
ClaimBuster	4238	We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform.	1
ClaimBuster	4239	I'm not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we've discussed tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	4240	Could I respond to that, Jim?	0
ClaimBuster	4241	Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.	1
ClaimBuster	4242	There are great public schools where there's public school choice, accountability and brilliant principals.	0
ClaimBuster	4243	Mostly that's just me opposing George Bush's wrong headed policies since I've been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I worked with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying we'll list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that John's been railing about.	1
ClaimBuster	4244	We're not going to touch Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	4245	Nobody wants gridlock anymore, and so let's get the program through.	0
ClaimBuster	4246	The key is whether or not we've got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and that's mostly lobbyists and special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	4247	Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others.	1
ClaimBuster	4248	And we paid down the debt of our nation for two years in a row, and we created 23 million new jobs at the same time.	1
ClaimBuster	4249	And he said the mark of a good judge, good justice, is that when you're reading their decision, their opinion, you can't tell if it's written by a man or woman, a liberal or a conservative, a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian.	0
ClaimBuster	4250	We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members.	0
ClaimBuster	4251	They don't vote for war.	0
ClaimBuster	4252	Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	4253	Let me do first on a personal level.	0
ClaimBuster	4254	Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.	0
ClaimBuster	4255	They analyzed the senator's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	4256	She understands that autism is on the rise, that we've got to find out what's causing it, and we've got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.	1
ClaimBuster	4257	Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.	0
ClaimBuster	4258	The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	4259	Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesn't keep up with the new medicines.	0
ClaimBuster	4260	Who has the experience that we trust?	0
ClaimBuster	4261	We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.	1
ClaimBuster	4262	Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.	0
ClaimBuster	4263	Please don't get into the Washington Post.	0
ClaimBuster	4264	It's another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right.	0
ClaimBuster	4265	That was a great doctrine throughout the Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	4266	This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.	0
ClaimBuster	4267	The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.	1
ClaimBuster	4268	Governor Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment -- he has to do it, that is the law.	1
ClaimBuster	4269	And I will be a good president.	0
ClaimBuster	4270	The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?	0
ClaimBuster	4271	And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view.	0
ClaimBuster	4272	The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year.	0
ClaimBuster	4273	I'm not satisfied when I see men like Jimmy Hoffa - in charge of the largest union in the United States - still free.	1
ClaimBuster	4274	He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	4275	I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	4276	He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.	1
ClaimBuster	4277	Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.	1
ClaimBuster	4278	And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter.	0
ClaimBuster	4279	We think that's pretty good progress.	0
ClaimBuster	4280	I will never send troops anywhere on a mission of that kind without telling them that if somebody shoots at them, they can darn well shoot back.	0
ClaimBuster	4281	I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	4282	Right, thank you for that.	0
ClaimBuster	4283	I have laid out a different plan, because the president's plan is not working.	0
ClaimBuster	4284	And there are several there's a good political reason because it's just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	4285	They've got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need.	0
ClaimBuster	4286	China has an interest that's very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world.	1
ClaimBuster	4287	Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.	1
ClaimBuster	4288	That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	4289	I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools.	1
ClaimBuster	4290	I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	4291	It was a new negotiation because, as I say, President Ford was within about 10% of having a solution that could be acceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	4292	And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?	0
ClaimBuster	4293	(Laughter) You don't want us to mention appointees, but when you see the quality of people in our administration, see how Colin Powell performed -- I say administration --	0
ClaimBuster	4294	It has grown in the past seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	4295	Now we will probably need to increase that to same extent.	0
ClaimBuster	4296	"I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of ""rich."""	0
ClaimBuster	4297	And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.	0
ClaimBuster	4298	I was honored to be there.	0
ClaimBuster	4299	There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	4300	We used to have 18.	1
ClaimBuster	4301	I think we've dramatically changed the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4302	The formal doctrine is very arcane, but I'm going to ask you to deal with it anyway.	0
ClaimBuster	4303	The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	4304	You've got to reform Congress, they've got to be servants of the people again; you've got to reform the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	4305	And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	4306	Credit card debt has never been higher.	1
ClaimBuster	4307	Not just to you, but to the entire nation.	0
ClaimBuster	4308	The fact remains almost 30% of his proposed tax cut goes to -- only to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.	1
ClaimBuster	4309	If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4310	Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so.	0
ClaimBuster	4311	Because it's the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	4312	Soldiers must understand why we're going.	0
ClaimBuster	4313	But I have a plan to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	4314	And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part.	0
ClaimBuster	4315	And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	4316	Many inner-city kids just move through.	1
ClaimBuster	4317	Well, we do come from different places.	1
ClaimBuster	4318	And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better.	0
ClaimBuster	4319	Who would have 1200 airplanes worth 2 billion a year just to fly around in?	0
ClaimBuster	4320	Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	4321	Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	4322	And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.	0
ClaimBuster	4323	And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	4324	The Constitution of the United States says we're all -- you know, it doesn't say that.	0
ClaimBuster	4325	If you don't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.	0
ClaimBuster	4326	What I have proposed for a long time, and I've had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let's be clear and let's have some straight talk.	0
ClaimBuster	4327	We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions.	1
ClaimBuster	4328	Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.	1
ClaimBuster	4329	We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	4330	Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.	1
ClaimBuster	4331	Many say four and a half per cent.	0
ClaimBuster	4332	They're almost at the bottom on every single category.	1
ClaimBuster	4333	And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered.	1
ClaimBuster	4334	And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn't have long-term designs on it.	0
ClaimBuster	4335	Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state.	0
ClaimBuster	4336	I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.	0
ClaimBuster	4337	But they were not in accordance with international law.	1
ClaimBuster	4338	I am a free trader.	1
ClaimBuster	4339	I was in coal country.	1
ClaimBuster	4340	We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.	0
ClaimBuster	4341	That's how you determine if children are progressing to excellence.	0
ClaimBuster	4342	We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of.	0
ClaimBuster	4343	I said in 1992 he didn't extend that courtesy to President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	4344	We have -- we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.	0
ClaimBuster	4345	And they don't want them.	0
ClaimBuster	4346	Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down.	1
ClaimBuster	4347	North Korea, first, I do.	0
ClaimBuster	4348	I'm watching Hillary go over facts.	0
ClaimBuster	4349	Mr. President, I'd like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I'll go on to another question.	0
ClaimBuster	4350	But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	4351	The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.	1
ClaimBuster	4352	A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh - eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing - in things like housing, uh - pollution control, uh - crime control, education, welfare and health.	0
ClaimBuster	4353	He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land.	0
ClaimBuster	4354	But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	4355	But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting.	0
ClaimBuster	4356	He still believes it's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	4357	And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented -- it's already been passed -- if it's implemented fully, it'll be another $2,500 on top.	1
ClaimBuster	4358	Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	4359	This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies.	1
ClaimBuster	4360	And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	4361	We've got a bumper crop this year.	1
ClaimBuster	4362	At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean -- without an increase in tax rates -- that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues.	1
ClaimBuster	4363	We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.	1
ClaimBuster	4364	Obviously it has a lot to do with interest rates --	0
ClaimBuster	4365	That's exactly where we find ourselves today.	0
ClaimBuster	4366	You will decide whether we're going to keep fighting crime with a Brady Bill, assault weapons and finish putting those 100,000 police.	0
ClaimBuster	4367	You talk about the surge.	0
ClaimBuster	4368	We've had the Central Accounting.	1
ClaimBuster	4369	We can work on nuclear power plants.	0
ClaimBuster	4370	That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain.	1
ClaimBuster	4371	He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.	1
ClaimBuster	4372	That boo was excessively loud.	0
ClaimBuster	4373	And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.	0
ClaimBuster	4374	And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	4375	And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.	0
ClaimBuster	4376	And I think it's this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft.	0
ClaimBuster	4377	Well, maybe someday, somebody can dream of that.	0
ClaimBuster	4378	Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.	0
ClaimBuster	4379	This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	4380	We've always had at least 7 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	4381	My call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year.	0
ClaimBuster	4382	Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4383	And we did drive them to the negotiating table.	0
ClaimBuster	4384	I think it's much less than it was the day after 9/11.	0
ClaimBuster	4385	There was a lot at stake there, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	4386	I would take the use of force very seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	4387	We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed.	1
ClaimBuster	4388	Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	4389	You know who voted for it?	0
ClaimBuster	4390	I hope I'm that person.	0
ClaimBuster	4391	And that's what America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	4392	Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report.	0
ClaimBuster	4393	You, it's amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools.	0
ClaimBuster	4394	So the price of oil has been way down.	1
ClaimBuster	4395	It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.	0
ClaimBuster	4396	If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.	0
ClaimBuster	4397	Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet.	0
ClaimBuster	4398	That's how strongly I feel about it.	0
ClaimBuster	4399	He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn't the reason that he broke up the conference.	1
ClaimBuster	4400	I propose $2 billion worth.	0
ClaimBuster	4401	But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	4402	I applaud the no-fly zone, and I know that he's going back to the United Nations to try to get authority to enforce it.	0
ClaimBuster	4403	Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4404	You'll get an access to life-long learning and education, help with tuition if you want to get a new skill or training.	1
ClaimBuster	4405	A promise made will be a promise kept.	0
ClaimBuster	4406	I think the American people tonight have much to be grateful for -- an economic recovery that has become expansion, freedom and, most of all, we are at peace.	1
ClaimBuster	4407	And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times.	1
ClaimBuster	4408	And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees.	1
ClaimBuster	4409	I believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something.	0
ClaimBuster	4410	That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves.	0
ClaimBuster	4411	We're talk about those two paths.	0
ClaimBuster	4412	Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay.	1
ClaimBuster	4413	They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.	0
ClaimBuster	4414	Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he'd go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	4415	It's a school of strong discipline and high standards.	0
ClaimBuster	4416	And so I believe that we've got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers' union.	0
ClaimBuster	4417	And we'll continue to spend money on research and development, because I truly believe that's the way to get from how we live today to being able to live a standard of living that we're accustomed to and being able to protect our environment better, the use of technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	4418	When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you'll go bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	4419	First of all, let's talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up.	1
ClaimBuster	4420	This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4421	But not until they have given us the full accounting of our MIAs.	0
ClaimBuster	4422	That's not the way we should judge these nominees.	0
ClaimBuster	4423	I believe I'm going to win, because the American people know I know how to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	4424	I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	4425	And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake.	0
ClaimBuster	4426	My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here.	1
ClaimBuster	4427	And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	4428	We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.	0
ClaimBuster	4429	We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women.	0
ClaimBuster	4430	Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	4431	But there's a record, and that's what I hope people look at.	1
ClaimBuster	4432	We passed it out of the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	4433	I'll go one step further.	0
ClaimBuster	4434	They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them.	0
ClaimBuster	4435	One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.	1
ClaimBuster	4436	And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.	0
ClaimBuster	4437	In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things.	0
ClaimBuster	4438	Do I have 1 minute?	0
ClaimBuster	4439	But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	4440	And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.	0
ClaimBuster	4441	You're going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you're spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebody's getting it.	1
ClaimBuster	4442	And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.	0
ClaimBuster	4443	In fact, he said he wants to announce that he's going to attack Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	4444	And the last thing I'd like to say is this: This grain deal with the Soviet Union in '72 was terrible, and Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	4445	I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh - Voting Rights Acts and the uh - Civil Rights Acts in their uh - debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	4446	That we're a nation under God.	0
ClaimBuster	4447	It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...	1
ClaimBuster	4448	I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.	1
ClaimBuster	4449	How about Dr. Lou Sullivan?	0
ClaimBuster	4450	And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.	0
ClaimBuster	4451	All of them with little or no health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	4452	With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%.	1
ClaimBuster	4453	I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.	0
ClaimBuster	4454	And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in -- in Chinese companies.	1
ClaimBuster	4455	But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and he'll do an outstanding job.	0
ClaimBuster	4456	But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union.	0
ClaimBuster	4457	Sure, but the problem is, you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good.	0
ClaimBuster	4458	I said we had too many slums.	0
ClaimBuster	4459	The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy.	0
ClaimBuster	4460	Ninety percent of the casualties are American.	1
ClaimBuster	4461	If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.	0
ClaimBuster	4462	So I've got a history of reaching across the aisle.	1
ClaimBuster	4463	Under this administration that strength has not been realized.	0
ClaimBuster	4464	If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.	0
ClaimBuster	4465	I owe everything to you, the people of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	4466	It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	4467	We'd have that trouble all over America.	0
ClaimBuster	4468	But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.	0
ClaimBuster	4469	But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	4470	Do you realize today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college?	1
ClaimBuster	4471	We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.	1
ClaimBuster	4472	We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can use your health insurance if you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick.	1
ClaimBuster	4473	I don't think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe; I really don't.	0
ClaimBuster	4474	Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.	1
ClaimBuster	4475	If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.	0
ClaimBuster	4476	"But again, I want to come back to, notice every time Senator Obama says, ""We need to spend more, we need to spend more, that's the answer"" -- why do we always have to spend more?"	0
ClaimBuster	4477	"And then she said, ""But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that you'll do everything in your power to make sure that my son's death was not in vain."""	1
ClaimBuster	4478	That's unacceptable for us, and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	4479	So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.	1
ClaimBuster	4480	Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.	0
ClaimBuster	4481	As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.	1
ClaimBuster	4482	Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.	0
ClaimBuster	4483	Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make.	0
ClaimBuster	4484	And I'd like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal.	0
ClaimBuster	4485	And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.	0
ClaimBuster	4486	And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.	0
ClaimBuster	4487	And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings.	0
ClaimBuster	4488	I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen.	0
ClaimBuster	4489	I don't have any speechwriters.	1
ClaimBuster	4490	If you make more than $25,000 a year you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you're pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	4491	He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	4492	I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.	0
ClaimBuster	4493	That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.	0
ClaimBuster	4494	It is our greatest ally in the region.	1
ClaimBuster	4495	When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.	1
ClaimBuster	4496	I don't think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else.	0
ClaimBuster	4497	But it is things that people say.	0
ClaimBuster	4498	We have to be bold.	0
ClaimBuster	4499	But I wanted the American people to know I was willing to give up something.	0
ClaimBuster	4500	But this issue of certainty.	0
ClaimBuster	4501	Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.	1
ClaimBuster	4502	We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.	1
ClaimBuster	4503	Many people are predicting a recession.	0
ClaimBuster	4504	We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make.	0
ClaimBuster	4505	And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	4506	The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	4507	Which our country should do, too.	0
ClaimBuster	4508	Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get.	1
ClaimBuster	4509	The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	4510	My opponent thinks the government -- the surplus is the government's money.	0
ClaimBuster	4511	Isn't it time to do it?	0
ClaimBuster	4512	So we're distributing in our State of Texas for free.	1
ClaimBuster	4513	But I'll tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	4514	Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time.	1
ClaimBuster	4515	We have got to have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	4516	Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.	0
ClaimBuster	4517	And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.	0
ClaimBuster	4518	Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	4519	We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work and we ought to create the finest education system in the world where every 18-year-old can go on to college and all of our younger children have great educational opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	4520	But we've got to get costs down.	0
ClaimBuster	4521	I think medical care should go with the person.	0
ClaimBuster	4522	But it was done three years ago and they're still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	4523	You don't negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	4524	And finally, we were a party to the convention -- to working with Germany, France and Great Britain to send their foreign ministers into Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	4525	It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.	0
ClaimBuster	4526	But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	4527	Jim, we've got the capability of doing both.	0
ClaimBuster	4528	We'll take the proper action at the proper time.	0
ClaimBuster	4529	It's bigger than our respective parties.	0
ClaimBuster	4530	We're on the side of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	4531	Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.	1
ClaimBuster	4532	And as a consequence, veterans' unemployment is actually now lower than general population.	1
ClaimBuster	4533	In the Oval Office, there's a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named -- by Tom Lee.	1
ClaimBuster	4534	And so I don't know the man well, but I've been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs.	0
ClaimBuster	4535	But in -- oh, but I do.	0
ClaimBuster	4536	And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	4537	First, I think Mary Fisher was a great choice.	0
ClaimBuster	4538	So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.	0
ClaimBuster	4539	Mr. President, you measure it by whether you're getting the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	4540	... you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.	0
ClaimBuster	4541	But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.	0
ClaimBuster	4542	You've seen co-pays go up, deductibles go up.	1
ClaimBuster	4543	I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82.	0
ClaimBuster	4544	We have to provide leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	4545	In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it.	1
ClaimBuster	4546	And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.	0
ClaimBuster	4547	I mean, I think in general, let's talk about these issues.	0
ClaimBuster	4548	Obviously some people are going to need help.	0
ClaimBuster	4549	And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	4550	But most importantly, we're going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and we're going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests aren't driving the process and your voices aren't being drowned out.	0
ClaimBuster	4551	The President's record is quite different.	0
ClaimBuster	4552	He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort.	1
ClaimBuster	4553	First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster.	1
ClaimBuster	4554	All groups of people are growing.	1
ClaimBuster	4555	This seems to be a trend.	0
ClaimBuster	4556	I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	4557	And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know.	1
ClaimBuster	4558	Typical cost to you and me is $125,000.	1
ClaimBuster	4559	And they're starting to finally make progress.	0
ClaimBuster	4560	OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied.	0
ClaimBuster	4561	And I'm paying for all that for those guys.	1
ClaimBuster	4562	With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there's an exception for the mother's health and life, and this did not contain that exception.	1
ClaimBuster	4563	And we're going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	4564	He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	4565	You know who voted against it?	0
ClaimBuster	4566	I'd have made a better choice.	0
ClaimBuster	4567	And now the tax code is more fair.	0
ClaimBuster	4568	So that's not where we ought to go.	0
ClaimBuster	4569	Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.	1
ClaimBuster	4570	And I ask for your support for 4 more years to finish this job.	0
ClaimBuster	4571	And we're making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction.	1
ClaimBuster	4572	I'm going to give you a tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	4573	And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security.	0
ClaimBuster	4574	Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	4575	My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is.	0
ClaimBuster	4576	But look, this has been going on for a year.	1
ClaimBuster	4577	We've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose as president.	0
ClaimBuster	4578	Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	4579	It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.	0
ClaimBuster	4580	That's the country that I'm going to fight for.	0
ClaimBuster	4581	I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	4582	But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.	0
ClaimBuster	4583	I told you never would I do such a thing.	0
ClaimBuster	4584	When President Bush decided we're not going to talk to Iran, we're not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened?	0
ClaimBuster	4585	And we are helping democracy, Ross.	0
ClaimBuster	4586	If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.	0
ClaimBuster	4587	His experience has been different from mine.	0
ClaimBuster	4588	They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.	0
ClaimBuster	4589	And -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel.	0
ClaimBuster	4590	I hear there's rumors on the Internets (sic) that we're going to have a draft.	0
ClaimBuster	4591	I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4592	And as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lies for the few that did not get excised or changed, we certainly are going to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	4593	... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.	1
ClaimBuster	4594	It will be a growing and a closer relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	4595	And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.	0
ClaimBuster	4596	The government pays for Medicare and Medicaid, as you know, and that's very important.	1
ClaimBuster	4597	There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	4598	I think we need to invest and save more.	0
ClaimBuster	4599	Take for example the marriage penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	4600	Well, we're on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	4601	So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.	0
ClaimBuster	4602	And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	4603	Now, I can't say when this can come.	0
ClaimBuster	4604	It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	4605	I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.	0
ClaimBuster	4606	I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar.	1
ClaimBuster	4607	The great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	4608	And it works- -it works in Milwaukee.	1
ClaimBuster	4609	I took the pledge we'd cut it out.	0
ClaimBuster	4610	I don't agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	4611	We have an opportunity to have real leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	4612	We also ought to convert more vehicles to compressed natural gas.	0
ClaimBuster	4613	But I don't think it's fair.	0
ClaimBuster	4614	When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.	1
ClaimBuster	4615	I love the strong women around me.	0
ClaimBuster	4616	"I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and we've got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, ""How can I get disability payments?"	1
ClaimBuster	4617	That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	4618	This has not been done, unfortunately.	0
ClaimBuster	4619	Three, we have to consolidate the federal programs to free districts to free the schools and encourage innovators like Michael.	0
ClaimBuster	4620	My opponent had trouble, criticized us, on our policy in Angola.	1
ClaimBuster	4621	20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.	1
ClaimBuster	4622	Proud that they voted hopefully for me.	0
ClaimBuster	4623	We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978.	0
ClaimBuster	4624	I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.	0
ClaimBuster	4625	When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test.	1
ClaimBuster	4626	I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so.	0
ClaimBuster	4627	Let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	4628	So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.	0
ClaimBuster	4629	Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.	1
ClaimBuster	4630	Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report.	1
ClaimBuster	4631	Uh - Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985.	1
ClaimBuster	4632	People who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don't make enough income.	0
ClaimBuster	4633	What do we have to do?	0
ClaimBuster	4634	The government has a role.	0
ClaimBuster	4635	I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	4636	But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.	0
ClaimBuster	4637	No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that I've just outlined.	0
ClaimBuster	4638	We passed family and medical leave.	1
ClaimBuster	4639	We've got to try to have talks, understanding that we're not taking military options off the table.	0
ClaimBuster	4640	And I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D - 5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetman -- we have a whole range of technology.	1
ClaimBuster	4641	Doesn't your policy really imply that we're going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we're not gonna be able to do much - very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.	0
ClaimBuster	4642	I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	4643	So we need to preserve the system.	0
ClaimBuster	4644	But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	4645	But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve.	0
ClaimBuster	4646	If drugs were legal, I don't think he'd be alive today.	0
ClaimBuster	4647	You just can't promise something like that just to get elected if you know there's a good chance that circumstances may overtake you.	0
ClaimBuster	4648	My opponent was against that.	1
ClaimBuster	4649	Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government?	0
ClaimBuster	4650	We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	4651	And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate.	1
ClaimBuster	4652	But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise.	0
ClaimBuster	4653	This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.	1
ClaimBuster	4654	I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families.	0
ClaimBuster	4655	You would even be proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	4656	And -- and the -- and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	4657	Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system.	0
ClaimBuster	4658	We need fundamental change in this country, and that's what I'd like to bring.	0
ClaimBuster	4659	I happen to think it's double that.	0
ClaimBuster	4660	If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax.	1
ClaimBuster	4661	But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.	0
ClaimBuster	4662	And the question, is it worth the cost, reminds me of my own thinking when I came back from fighting in that war.	0
ClaimBuster	4663	But I will tell you, I've been all over.	0
ClaimBuster	4664	This administration seems to run that every morning.	0
ClaimBuster	4665	I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies.	0
ClaimBuster	4666	Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?	0
ClaimBuster	4667	That means keep government out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	4668	And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.	1
ClaimBuster	4669	That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	4670	We've expanded Pell Grants by a million students.	1
ClaimBuster	4671	I'm the president that stood up and said, don't mess with Social Security, and I'm not going to and we haven't and we are not going to go after the Social Security recipient.	1
ClaimBuster	4672	And if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough.	0
ClaimBuster	4673	would agree with us as well.	0
ClaimBuster	4674	You might say that took a lot of hard work.	0
ClaimBuster	4675	And they're very fine and very highly qualified.	0
ClaimBuster	4676	I was born in Detroit.	1
ClaimBuster	4677	But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.	0
ClaimBuster	4678	That's not just going after places where there's abuse.	0
ClaimBuster	4679	Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.	0
ClaimBuster	4680	A lot of uh - very high quality, low-carbon coal, uh - low-sulfur coal is there, it's where our employment is needed.	1
ClaimBuster	4681	And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.	1
ClaimBuster	4682	And I saw a problem in the public education system in America.	0
ClaimBuster	4683	I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	4684	As I understand it, we're building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they've got a rather permanent concept to them.	1
ClaimBuster	4685	My dad was head of a car company.	1
ClaimBuster	4686	You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money.	0
ClaimBuster	4687	And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.	1
ClaimBuster	4688	And I think that would be a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	4689	And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	4690	Now, we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	4691	That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for.	0
ClaimBuster	4692	I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.	1
ClaimBuster	4693	I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements they've already made.	0
ClaimBuster	4694	Reduce the capital gains rate.	0
ClaimBuster	4695	And one of those dreams is justice.	0
ClaimBuster	4696	Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.	1
ClaimBuster	4697	I will give middle-class Americans tax cuts, meaningful ones.	0
ClaimBuster	4698	Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.	0
ClaimBuster	4699	"He said, ""Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain."	0
ClaimBuster	4700	In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	4701	And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in.	1
ClaimBuster	4702	We would have to close twenty military bases in the United States immediately.	1
ClaimBuster	4703	A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.	0
ClaimBuster	4704	But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs.	1
ClaimBuster	4705	I'm going to give the President some credit.	0
ClaimBuster	4706	Yes, I think it is.	0
ClaimBuster	4707	We have deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions.	1
ClaimBuster	4708	We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that.	1
ClaimBuster	4709	ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level.	0
ClaimBuster	4710	I'm also a former law enforcement officer.	1
ClaimBuster	4711	But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	4712	And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time.	1
ClaimBuster	4713	Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan.	1
ClaimBuster	4714	So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened.	0
ClaimBuster	4715	But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.	0
ClaimBuster	4716	But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.	0
ClaimBuster	4717	If I have anything in politics, it's my word.	0
ClaimBuster	4718	I think you've seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing - we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft.	1
ClaimBuster	4719	And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	4720	I get wound up because I feel strongly --	0
ClaimBuster	4721	You're going to have a lot of new members of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	4722	And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates?	0
ClaimBuster	4723	And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	4724	For two years, the president didn't even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor.	1
ClaimBuster	4725	But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they're rushing to build a lot more.	1
ClaimBuster	4726	That's one thing I learned by forging that tremendous and greatly--highly successful coalition against Saddam Hussein, the dictator.	0
ClaimBuster	4727	You walk down the street, you get shot.	1
ClaimBuster	4728	And the reason he didn't is, he said -- he wrote in his book -- because there was no viable exit strategy.	1
ClaimBuster	4729	So yes, I think it should be expanded.	0
ClaimBuster	4730	And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.	0
ClaimBuster	4731	That's like the family of medical-leave law; it just tries to set the rules of the game.	0
ClaimBuster	4732	You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo.	0
ClaimBuster	4733	You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and that's what we did in my state.	1
ClaimBuster	4734	And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us.	0
ClaimBuster	4735	I disapprove of the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	4736	Ronald Reagan got together with Tip O'Neill and Howard Baker, two Republicans and one Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	4737	But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention, as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world - in those respects, we're not strong.	0
ClaimBuster	4738	I have sustained it since then.	1
ClaimBuster	4739	Talking about this and this.	0
ClaimBuster	4740	You can't have 23 million people struggling to get a job.	0
ClaimBuster	4741	Some of it's said in entertainment.	0
ClaimBuster	4742	And we want a democracy in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	4743	And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, we'll also spread freedom and liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	4744	We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.	1
ClaimBuster	4745	Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.	1
ClaimBuster	4746	I supported giving parents a V-chip on their television so if they don't want their young kids to watch things they shouldn't watch, they wouldn't have to.	1
ClaimBuster	4747	The inclination that Governor Reagan has exemplified in many troubled times since he has been running for President - I think since 1968 - to inject American military forces in places like North Korea, to put a blockade around Cuba this year, or in some instances, to project American forces into a fishing dispute against the small nation of Ecuador on the west coast of South America.	1
ClaimBuster	4748	It had nothing to do with the debate on Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	4749	Think of this as their country.	0
ClaimBuster	4750	He gets the first --	0
ClaimBuster	4751	There's only 25 percent of the people in there.	1
ClaimBuster	4752	What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments to take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us.	0
ClaimBuster	4753	Everybody cares if people aren't doing well.	0
ClaimBuster	4754	That's what happened in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	4755	"And consequently, I don't think it's enough to go before Republican audiences - and I never do - and say, ""Look, vote for me because I'm a Republican."""	0
ClaimBuster	4756	101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do.	0
ClaimBuster	4757	The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office.	0
ClaimBuster	4758	We're not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users.	0
ClaimBuster	4759	I support the President's position.	0
ClaimBuster	4760	Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.	1
ClaimBuster	4761	His some of his college presidents aren't exactly holier than thou.	0
ClaimBuster	4762	Now, if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you're going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.	0
ClaimBuster	4763	And I'll do a good job, because I am committed.	0
ClaimBuster	4764	And that's not the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	4765	We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.	0
ClaimBuster	4766	I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack.	0
ClaimBuster	4767	We've had a lot of other presidents who didn't wear their country's uniform who had to order our young soldiers into battle, including President Wilson and President Roosevelt.	1
ClaimBuster	4768	She said, reading is the new civil right.	1
ClaimBuster	4769	The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned.	0
ClaimBuster	4770	We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy.	0
ClaimBuster	4771	We are serving a million more families now.	1
ClaimBuster	4772	And I'm afraid that's what I think I'm hearing from Governor Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	4773	And as a result, our universities are now more diverse.	1
ClaimBuster	4774	If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	4775	And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise.	1
ClaimBuster	4776	We've sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	4777	It is believed that probably 70% of the potential oil in the United States is probably hidden in those lands, and no one is allowed to even go and explore to find out if it is there.	1
ClaimBuster	4778	How do you do that?	0
ClaimBuster	4779	Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	1
ClaimBuster	4780	This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	4781	Let the states and localities do that.	0
ClaimBuster	4782	And when we had Osama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1,000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains.	1
ClaimBuster	4783	It had nothing to do with us.	1
ClaimBuster	4784	Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play.	0
ClaimBuster	4785	Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people.	0
ClaimBuster	4786	And that is to get the support of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	4787	Secondly, I've said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	4788	It just shows a significant difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	4789	I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.	0
ClaimBuster	4790	Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.	1
ClaimBuster	4791	I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family.	1
ClaimBuster	4792	They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five.	1
ClaimBuster	4793	I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly.	0
ClaimBuster	4794	Now we cannot allow a second Holocaust.	0
ClaimBuster	4795	Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.	1
ClaimBuster	4796	I don't know -- starting after 4 years.	0
ClaimBuster	4797	I see that as part of my job as president, and I'll make my best effort to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	4798	"The way my opponent talks, he said, ""We're going to spend the government's money."	1
ClaimBuster	4799	And that fact is just not right.	1
ClaimBuster	4800	I promised a new beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	4801	I would pass a hate crimes law, as I said, and I guess I had misunderstood the governor's previous position.	1
ClaimBuster	4802	That's what took us from surplus to deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	4803	Maybe we will have another debate on the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	4804	They're back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.	1
ClaimBuster	4805	When Harry Truman was president he was not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	4806	Most recently out in Aurora.	0
ClaimBuster	4807	And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.	0
ClaimBuster	4808	You've got a back-door draft right now.	0
ClaimBuster	4809	Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	4810	I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people.	0
ClaimBuster	4811	You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.	0
ClaimBuster	4812	And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.	0
ClaimBuster	4813	I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care.	0
ClaimBuster	4814	We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	4815	Now, let's look at priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	4816	I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them.	0
ClaimBuster	4817	I -- I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	4818	It would go into the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	4819	She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...	1
ClaimBuster	4820	But if you don't have the guts to control costs by changing the insurance system and taking on the bureaucracies and the regulation of health care in the private and public sector, you can't fix this problem.	0
ClaimBuster	4821	I want the line-item veto.	0
ClaimBuster	4822	And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come.	0
ClaimBuster	4823	You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	0
ClaimBuster	4824	We're low spending, low tax burden.	1
ClaimBuster	4825	I think the American people should take into account who we are as individuals, what our experience is, what our positions are on the issues and proposals are.	0
ClaimBuster	4826	We have a fundamental difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	4827	Let me just say to you, number one, don't throw the labels around.	0
ClaimBuster	4828	Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter.	1
ClaimBuster	4829	There are 7 trillion dollars in assets locked up in America.	1
ClaimBuster	4830	So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent.	0
ClaimBuster	4831	It's the US that's taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	4832	We've got a great economic package which I hope we will discuss later.	0
ClaimBuster	4833	One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.	1
ClaimBuster	4834	"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country."""	0
ClaimBuster	4835	We've shipped millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out.	1
ClaimBuster	4836	We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis.	0
ClaimBuster	4837	So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November.	0
ClaimBuster	4838	It was lies, and it was fiction.	0
ClaimBuster	4839	Can we start the clock over?	0
ClaimBuster	4840	It's a part of the Social Security system.	1
ClaimBuster	4841	I don't have time to tell you the stories.	0
ClaimBuster	4842	Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	4843	Look what happened to her.	0
ClaimBuster	4844	About a year ago he cut the Pentagon budget six point eight billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	4845	You've got to look at our records.	0
ClaimBuster	4846	And we can do it, too.	0
ClaimBuster	4847	I'm addressing him all evening as Mr. President.	1
ClaimBuster	4848	And there's no market forces involved with health care.	1
ClaimBuster	4849	Well, Mr. Ford is - is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy.	1
ClaimBuster	4850	So I consider that a compliment.	0
ClaimBuster	4851	I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties.	1
ClaimBuster	4852	Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	4853	And my word is good.	0
ClaimBuster	4854	They're not left or right.	0
ClaimBuster	4855	We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years.	0
ClaimBuster	4856	√É‚Äö But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done.	0
ClaimBuster	4857	Our people wanna go back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	4858	All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives.	1
ClaimBuster	4859	And John has just made up some very interesting figures.	0
ClaimBuster	4860	My message to the troops is also: Thank you for what they're doing, but it's also help is on the way.	0
ClaimBuster	4861	We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.	0
ClaimBuster	4862	When I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan straits.	0
ClaimBuster	4863	In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	4864	We need to get the economy going.	0
ClaimBuster	4865	In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.	1
ClaimBuster	4866	It is a serious problem, but I don't see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was.	0
ClaimBuster	4867	After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently.	0
ClaimBuster	4868	Choose your doctor, choose your plan.	0
ClaimBuster	4869	The auto industry has come roaring back.	0
ClaimBuster	4870	When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, all the young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up, who is he talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	4871	We're going to have a strong border.	0
ClaimBuster	4872	And we all have ideas out there, and Mr. Bush has a record.	0
ClaimBuster	4873	I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	4874	Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	4875	It means that there will be increased employment.	0
ClaimBuster	4876	I decided the right action was in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	4877	And the President, Mr. Mondale, has called you whining and vacillating, among the more charitable phrases -- weak, I believe.	1
ClaimBuster	4878	In the first century of our nation's history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind.	0
ClaimBuster	4879	The answer is very straightforward.	0
ClaimBuster	4880	If I say no, it ignores their behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	4881	More in July than June.	1
ClaimBuster	4882	So let me get this right.	0
ClaimBuster	4883	I am going to protect the American taxpayer against the spend and tax Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	4884	That's the one who is being aborted.	0
ClaimBuster	4885	People -- the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now.	1
ClaimBuster	4886	And when it gets overextended, morale drops.	0
ClaimBuster	4887	Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	4888	They seem to be simply retreads of the programs of the Truman Administration which preceded it.	1
ClaimBuster	4889	In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.	0
ClaimBuster	4890	And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great.	1
ClaimBuster	4891	But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.	1
ClaimBuster	4892	Plus, I want them all voting for me.	0
ClaimBuster	4893	and the military that liked it better the way it used to be.	0
ClaimBuster	4894	I can give you hundreds of -- you can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	4895	And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, we're not going to be able to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	4896	And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	4897	But I also want to say to seniors, if you're happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program.	0
ClaimBuster	4898	And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.	0
ClaimBuster	4899	That's the problem with our system.	0
ClaimBuster	4900	Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another.	0
ClaimBuster	4901	You see, I have a fundamental difference.	0
ClaimBuster	4902	That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	4903	An African American was my chief cabinet officer.	1
ClaimBuster	4904	And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, it's time to get it done once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	4905	I know how to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	4906	First of all, I won't repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.	1
ClaimBuster	4907	But we're going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go.	0
ClaimBuster	4908	That wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.	0
ClaimBuster	4909	It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them.	0
ClaimBuster	4910	Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	4911	But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.	1
ClaimBuster	4912	They retired General Shinseki for telling him that.	1
ClaimBuster	4913	We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize.	0
ClaimBuster	4914	We are not dependent upon the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	4915	The President inherited a good economy, sure the S&L crisis then were selling assets.	1
ClaimBuster	4916	We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.	0
ClaimBuster	4917	I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year.	0
ClaimBuster	4918	I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	4919	You can't stand there, Governor Clinton, and say, well, I think I'd have been -- I have supported the minority, let sanctions work or wish it would go away -- but I would have voted with the majority.	0
ClaimBuster	4920	In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had.	1
ClaimBuster	4921	They want us to talk about the problems of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	4922	I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world.	0
ClaimBuster	4923	... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse.	1
ClaimBuster	4924	She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	4925	The president can modify the uh - economic structure of a country by public statements and general attitudes in the budget that he proposes.	0
ClaimBuster	4926	She doesn't even know who the rebels are.	1
ClaimBuster	4927	They jumped on me yesterday for being a little optimistic about the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	4928	I'm appalled at the highest outrageous numbers of divorces -- it happens in families, it's happened in ours.	0
ClaimBuster	4929	Yes, I understand what it means to the commander in chief.	0
ClaimBuster	4930	The HMOs and the insurance companies support the other bill that's pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward.	1
ClaimBuster	4931	I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining.	0
ClaimBuster	4932	Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don't have to take all applicants.	1
ClaimBuster	4933	We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate.	1
ClaimBuster	4934	These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	4935	The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.	0
ClaimBuster	4936	I oppose supply management and production controls.	0
ClaimBuster	4937	And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently.	0
ClaimBuster	4938	... where they're not paying us what we need.	0
ClaimBuster	4939	Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs.	0
ClaimBuster	4940	They would have won an appeal.	0
ClaimBuster	4941	I propose to spend 1.6 trillion dollars on defense between now and the year 2002 and there's less than 1 percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense.	1
ClaimBuster	4942	Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?	0
ClaimBuster	4943	They've got sneak-and-peek searches that are allowed.	1
ClaimBuster	4944	I think we have to be very reticent about that.	0
ClaimBuster	4945	And he opposed even President Carter, when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	4946	I'd better correct the President.	0
ClaimBuster	4947	That's part -- that's part one.	0
ClaimBuster	4948	But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it's time to do some nation building here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	4949	That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well.	0
ClaimBuster	4950	Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life.	0
ClaimBuster	4951	I know what our needs are.	0
ClaimBuster	4952	And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.	1
ClaimBuster	4953	I don't think that our record of human rights can be assailed.	0
ClaimBuster	4954	We're one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage.	1
ClaimBuster	4955	Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?	0
ClaimBuster	4956	And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.	0
ClaimBuster	4957	I - I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford's position on gun control has changed.	1
ClaimBuster	4958	The people who have jobs and educations and opportunities that didn't have them 10 years ago don't think it's irrelevant at all; they think it's highly relevant and they wish the rest of the country had them.	0
ClaimBuster	4959	And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.	0
ClaimBuster	4960	What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.	0
ClaimBuster	4961	And I said, let's fix this system.	0
ClaimBuster	4962	I made a proposal three months ago on this.	1
ClaimBuster	4963	That's another story that we're going to pay a big price for right after the election.	0
ClaimBuster	4964	Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.	0
ClaimBuster	4965	We have an arms race underway instead.	0
ClaimBuster	4966	Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.	0
ClaimBuster	4967	It's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	4968	And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then we're asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers.	0
ClaimBuster	4969	You know, if they asked me to be part of some monitoring force -- as we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 -- to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israel, frankly, I would have to think about it.	0
ClaimBuster	4970	I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.	0
ClaimBuster	4971	And it fits with his philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	4972	So what would I have done?	0
ClaimBuster	4973	I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies.	1
ClaimBuster	4974	The charter of the United Nations - its Preamble, Article I and Article II - also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another.	1
ClaimBuster	4975	We don't talk about it.	0
ClaimBuster	4976	Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	4977	Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.	0
ClaimBuster	4978	But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	4979	If you don't have trust in that, I do.	0
ClaimBuster	4980	They're the best -- they're most -- have best -- we're the best exporters.	0
ClaimBuster	4981	The president moved the troops, so he's got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is.	1
ClaimBuster	4982	As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further.	0
ClaimBuster	4983	I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	4984	Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs.	0
ClaimBuster	4985	And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.	0
ClaimBuster	4986	We have always been willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area.	1
ClaimBuster	4987	Well, I-we obviously have a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	4988	Thank you very much, Jim, and I'll begin by answering your questions -- your last question.	0
ClaimBuster	4989	I mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog.	0
ClaimBuster	4990	We've got to do it now.	0
ClaimBuster	4991	Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	4992	Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	4993	It's a moral responsibility for us and the world.	0
ClaimBuster	4994	We simply cannot pull back.	0
ClaimBuster	4995	And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future.	0
ClaimBuster	4996	Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%.	1
ClaimBuster	4997	It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.	1
ClaimBuster	4998	He endorses the Democratic uh - platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs.	1
ClaimBuster	4999	I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	5000	I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.	0
ClaimBuster	5001	We started from the day we got into office.	1
ClaimBuster	5002	I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.	0
ClaimBuster	5003	We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it's worse this year than last year, and it's worse last year than the year before.	1
ClaimBuster	5004	And here is the simple difference.	0
ClaimBuster	5005	The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.	1
ClaimBuster	5006	He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.	1
ClaimBuster	5007	We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the -- the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties.	0
ClaimBuster	5008	We want freedom to gain.	0
ClaimBuster	5009	We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first.	1
ClaimBuster	5010	I've never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	5011	And I think that's the way it ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	5012	You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion.	0
ClaimBuster	5013	The same old experience is not relevant.	0
ClaimBuster	5014	When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon.	1
ClaimBuster	5015	I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	5016	Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea.	0
ClaimBuster	5017	And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.	1
ClaimBuster	5018	Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn't happen again.	0
ClaimBuster	5019	The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.	0
ClaimBuster	5020	But that's not the point here.	0
ClaimBuster	5021	My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	5022	On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley.	0
ClaimBuster	5023	This is a fair plan.	0
ClaimBuster	5024	The most recent has been the one in Brighton.	1
ClaimBuster	5025	"I talked to a man just briefly there who asked me one simple question: ""Do I have reason to hope that I can someday take care of my family again?"	1
ClaimBuster	5026	You talk about eight years?	0
ClaimBuster	5027	We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.	0
ClaimBuster	5028	I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.	0
ClaimBuster	5029	That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	5030	He shouldn't have made that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	5031	Perhaps Mrs. Truman can, but I don't think I can.	0
ClaimBuster	5032	We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh - Communists would take over in Portugal.	1
ClaimBuster	5033	"And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we brought him to justice."	1
ClaimBuster	5034	You couldn't have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage and making loans.	0
ClaimBuster	5035	Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.	1
ClaimBuster	5036	He saw the wisdom -- until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions.	1
ClaimBuster	5037	We're expanding veterans' health care throughout the country.	1
ClaimBuster	5038	And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.	1
ClaimBuster	5039	Every day is earth day if you own the land.	0
ClaimBuster	5040	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	1
ClaimBuster	5041	We need a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	5042	But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.	0
ClaimBuster	5043	Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	5044	I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both.	0
ClaimBuster	5045	But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.	0
ClaimBuster	5046	Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care.	0
ClaimBuster	5047	And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids.	0
ClaimBuster	5048	I was an altar boy.	1
ClaimBuster	5049	It's to make health care affordable and available this way.	0
ClaimBuster	5050	So we have to use our great people.	0
ClaimBuster	5051	Her donors took massive tax write-offs.	1
ClaimBuster	5052	When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	5053	I know we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	5054	And I'd love to be out of workers and have to import them, like some of our international competitors.	0
ClaimBuster	5055	I completely sustained the treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	5056	We ought to have rural enterprise zones.	0
ClaimBuster	5057	So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open.	0
ClaimBuster	5058	And the fact that you're making an investment in higher education is critical.	1
ClaimBuster	5059	Now, just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of Republicans and Democrats -- more Republicans than Democrats -- said my plan will save the average family $1200 a year more than the Bush plan will by the year 2000, $2.2 trillion in the next 12 years, $400 billion a year by the end of this decade.	1
ClaimBuster	5060	But I think we've got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science.	0
ClaimBuster	5061	And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	5062	If we can get it done in the first year, you bet.	0
ClaimBuster	5063	Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase.	1
ClaimBuster	5064	Let's talk about civil rights.	0
ClaimBuster	5065	"Pick that person in November because believe me, as I've said before, ""The party's over and it's time for the clean-up crew."""	1
ClaimBuster	5066	We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh - geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment.	0
ClaimBuster	5067	I've picked a lot of people.	1
ClaimBuster	5068	And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience.	0
ClaimBuster	5069	I supported what we did in Kosovo.	1
ClaimBuster	5070	I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.	0
ClaimBuster	5071	And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful.	0
ClaimBuster	5072	We're ahead of all of the Western European country.	1
ClaimBuster	5073	But because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they're qualified, I favor the right kind of Affirmative Action.	0
ClaimBuster	5074	That's why I don't think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity.	1
ClaimBuster	5075	George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years.	1
ClaimBuster	5076	That's why I think it's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	5077	That's not a grand coalition.	0
ClaimBuster	5078	That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.	0
ClaimBuster	5079	But understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5080	And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science.	0
ClaimBuster	5081	Let me mention something else the president said.	0
ClaimBuster	5082	We have 543 at present.	1
ClaimBuster	5083	And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I don't want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	5084	We have 100,000 to 200,000 embryos that are frozen in nitrogen today from fertility clinics.	1
ClaimBuster	5085	We're going to grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	5086	I believe that we have to do these things with a government that's smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless.	0
ClaimBuster	5087	It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political -- or private religious faith and the use of the state is where -- for the most personal decisions in American life -- that's where I draw the line.	0
ClaimBuster	5088	It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole.	1
ClaimBuster	5089	And that's why I've supported building up our capacity.	1
ClaimBuster	5090	If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5091	It's gotten a little nasty.	0
ClaimBuster	5092	In addition to that we've become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis.	0
ClaimBuster	5093	And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart.	1
ClaimBuster	5094	But that, too, will require some choices.	0
ClaimBuster	5095	We've cut it in half.	1
ClaimBuster	5096	That's what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities.	0
ClaimBuster	5097	He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break, and we're going to pay for it.	1
ClaimBuster	5098	That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.	0
ClaimBuster	5099	If you have health insurance, then you don't have to do anything.	0
ClaimBuster	5100	President Reagan said no, peace through strength.	1
ClaimBuster	5101	I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas, I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes.	0
ClaimBuster	5102	Is the person guilty of the crime?	0
ClaimBuster	5103	So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	5104	And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly -- not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside -- but a genuine effort to try to restore America's hope and possibilities by bringing people together.	0
ClaimBuster	5105	That is the best way.	0
ClaimBuster	5106	And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.	0
ClaimBuster	5107	The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.	1
ClaimBuster	5108	This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it.	0
ClaimBuster	5109	Every single country in Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	5110	Yes, we have fundamental differences.	0
ClaimBuster	5111	I'm not going to go around the country saying he didn't tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did.	0
ClaimBuster	5112	He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	5113	We've had 12 years of trickle down economics.	1
ClaimBuster	5114	And we're going to make sure people get punished for the crime.	0
ClaimBuster	5115	That's the problem with it.	0
ClaimBuster	5116	The worst thing is, again, it's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	5117	On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, he's a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects.	1
ClaimBuster	5118	I said that we would provide guarantees, and -- and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy.	1
ClaimBuster	5119	I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.	0
ClaimBuster	5120	We have them all day every day.	0
ClaimBuster	5121	I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad.	0
ClaimBuster	5122	You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	5123	The average uh American person can't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	5124	Because it's God's will, whatever happens.	0
ClaimBuster	5125	But I do think that you need to make an appeal every time you can to eliminate racial divisions and discrimination, and I'll keep on doing that and pointing to some legislative accomplishment to back it up.	0
ClaimBuster	5126	How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?	0
ClaimBuster	5127	It looks like a bombed-out city - great, gaunt skeletons of buildings.	0
ClaimBuster	5128	I think you can work on all three at once, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	5129	The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation.	1
ClaimBuster	5130	But there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments.	0
ClaimBuster	5131	They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed.	1
ClaimBuster	5132	If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	5133	That's not specific in terms of a program.	0
ClaimBuster	5134	... people, right, not for current retirees.	0
ClaimBuster	5135	And so I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	5136	I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.	0
ClaimBuster	5137	I think they may be using the man's own words.	0
ClaimBuster	5138	So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.	1
ClaimBuster	5139	The question is will it be the strongest in the years to come?	0
ClaimBuster	5140	We've got to get after the users more.	0
ClaimBuster	5141	We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system.	0
ClaimBuster	5142	I believe we can be better.	0
ClaimBuster	5143	"And she said to me, ""You know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me."""	1
ClaimBuster	5144	And they agree, that if we can do what I've said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again.	0
ClaimBuster	5145	What he's quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte, it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee that's not worth the government -- the taxpayer-paid paper that it's printed on.	1
ClaimBuster	5146	There's some question about their morality.	0
ClaimBuster	5147	You couldn't have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end.	0
ClaimBuster	5148	I think it's true of Latin America also.	1
ClaimBuster	5149	Outsourcing is going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	5150	When I was in the United States Congress, I worked with former President Reagan to modernize our strategic weaponry and to pursue arms control in a responsible way.	1
ClaimBuster	5151	Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	5152	But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made.	0
ClaimBuster	5153	And Pakistan is a very important element in this.	1
ClaimBuster	5154	In fact, I have written a book about it.	1
ClaimBuster	5155	So I'm going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act.	0
ClaimBuster	5156	But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.	0
ClaimBuster	5157	Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	5158	You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks.	0
ClaimBuster	5159	We owe China $500 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	5160	I don't have a tax cut of a scale that you're talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	5161	Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.	0
ClaimBuster	5162	It's also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing.	0
ClaimBuster	5163	And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.	0
ClaimBuster	5164	He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.	0
ClaimBuster	5165	Look at where we are today.	0
ClaimBuster	5166	And in the process the negatives began.	0
ClaimBuster	5167	"I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after ""read my lips"" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed."	1
ClaimBuster	5168	I'd make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention.	1
ClaimBuster	5169	I mean we're just a few miles away from Ellis Island.	1
ClaimBuster	5170	And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans.	1
ClaimBuster	5171	Key thing here, see, we all come up with images.	1
ClaimBuster	5172	In the past seven years, in President Eisenhower's Administration, this situation has been reversed.	1
ClaimBuster	5173	The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas.	1
ClaimBuster	5174	They are making some progress, not enough for us.	0
ClaimBuster	5175	If you're taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction.	1
ClaimBuster	5176	That'll help people who want to get off welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	5177	He has no record on reforming of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	5178	One of the key points in foreign policy and national security policy is the need to re-establish the old-fashioned principle that politics ought to stop at the water's edge.	0
ClaimBuster	5179	You know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing.	0
ClaimBuster	5180	Trying to figure out who the questioner was.	0
ClaimBuster	5181	I am not going to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	5182	Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	5183	I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.	0
ClaimBuster	5184	But governors are ready; mayors are ready.	0
ClaimBuster	5185	That's a big, big difference.	0
ClaimBuster	5186	And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity.	0
ClaimBuster	5187	And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger.	0
ClaimBuster	5188	The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.	0
ClaimBuster	5189	I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete.	0
ClaimBuster	5190	Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position.	1
ClaimBuster	5191	No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	5192	Under Governor Bush's tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drugs and national defense all combined.	1
ClaimBuster	5193	And it costs more to keep them in prison than it does to send them to Harvard.	1
ClaimBuster	5194	This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol.	0
ClaimBuster	5195	I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.	1
ClaimBuster	5196	or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	5197	I -- I have to respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	5198	I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care.	0
ClaimBuster	5199	I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.	0
ClaimBuster	5200	Well, I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up.	0
ClaimBuster	5201	I think that answers itself.	0
ClaimBuster	5202	So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?	1
ClaimBuster	5203	We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	5204	Part of it's because you can't -- you can't control the classroom.	0
ClaimBuster	5205	And as a consequence we'll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we've got a skilled workforce.	0
ClaimBuster	5206	That's what I've been doing for the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	5207	I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	5208	But it's now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers.	0
ClaimBuster	5209	But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.	0
ClaimBuster	5210	I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our country's business.	1
ClaimBuster	5211	He wants to unravel the six- party talks, or the five-nation coalition that's sending him a clear message.	0
ClaimBuster	5212	And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.	0
ClaimBuster	5213	I will lower taxes on middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	5214	But I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill.	0
ClaimBuster	5215	"Senator McCain, this is the guy who sang, ""Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,"" who called for the annihilation of North Korea."	1
ClaimBuster	5216	I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.	0
ClaimBuster	5217	We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains.	0
ClaimBuster	5218	Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.	0
ClaimBuster	5219	My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left.	0
ClaimBuster	5220	Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated.	0
ClaimBuster	5221	And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.	0
ClaimBuster	5222	This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	5223	More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	5224	Look, there's no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters.	1
ClaimBuster	5225	Because an enemy realizes the stakes.	0
ClaimBuster	5226	You want jobs in the inner city?	0
ClaimBuster	5227	They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.	0
ClaimBuster	5228	But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back.	1
ClaimBuster	5229	I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about.	1
ClaimBuster	5230	This -- what we're seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that's why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition.	0
ClaimBuster	5231	Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	5232	I'm not going to, because that would be pandering.	0
ClaimBuster	5233	We've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.	0
ClaimBuster	5234	And those are the people that I will appoint.	0
ClaimBuster	5235	It's almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then.	0
ClaimBuster	5236	Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible.	1
ClaimBuster	5237	It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.	0
ClaimBuster	5238	We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	5239	The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.	1
ClaimBuster	5240	I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim.	1
ClaimBuster	5241	I don't agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	5242	Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us.	1
ClaimBuster	5243	I came through small business.	1
ClaimBuster	5244	Every dollar that I've proposed, I've proposed an additional cut so that it matches.	1
ClaimBuster	5245	You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	5246	Now, I think those are the wrong priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	5247	It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	5248	And by the way, I've had that experience.	1
ClaimBuster	5249	I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	5250	In fact, 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the states had to comply or they're going to lose certain money.	1
ClaimBuster	5251	And I think right now we got to go back.	0
ClaimBuster	5252	And we've got to give them a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	5253	This situation got so bad that I decided I'd better get into it.	0
ClaimBuster	5254	So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	5255	And I know that I'm someone older than you.	1
ClaimBuster	5256	This has not been an ancient history story.	0
ClaimBuster	5257	And I said that at that time.	1
ClaimBuster	5258	It's his trustees, the President's trustees, not mine, who says it's going to go broke.	0
ClaimBuster	5259	It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.	0
ClaimBuster	5260	Our exports are dramatically up.	1
ClaimBuster	5261	And that's exactly what we're going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	5262	I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	5263	I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.	0
ClaimBuster	5264	It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	5265	But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?	0
ClaimBuster	5266	President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.	1
ClaimBuster	5267	And that will be my policy.	0
ClaimBuster	5268	So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.	0
ClaimBuster	5269	Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	5270	The reason why Prime Minister Allawi said they're coming across the border is because he recognizes that this is a central part of the war on terror.	1
ClaimBuster	5271	Uh - we'll have uh - a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do.	0
ClaimBuster	5272	No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ...	1
ClaimBuster	5273	I've touched more people's lives and seen more heartbreak and hope, more pain and more promise, than anybody else who's run for president this year.	0
ClaimBuster	5274	And I'm fighting to let you get those drugs from Canada, and I'm fighting to let Medicare survive.	1
ClaimBuster	5275	And I've worked hard for a long time to make them better, 90 percent of our kids are there.	1
ClaimBuster	5276	But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.	1
ClaimBuster	5277	Federal government has gone down, Texas's government has gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	5278	What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work.	0
ClaimBuster	5279	Now the second point we have to understand is this, however.	0
ClaimBuster	5280	This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.	0
ClaimBuster	5281	On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision.	1
ClaimBuster	5282	No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	5283	I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	5284	And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because I've been involved these issues for many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	5285	We worked too hard to lower it.	0
ClaimBuster	5286	And so we're moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment.	1
ClaimBuster	5287	And the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B - 1.	1
ClaimBuster	5288	They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology and things of that kind.	0
ClaimBuster	5289	I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I don't want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and that's what's happened in the last 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	5290	And that requires us to make some important choices.	0
ClaimBuster	5291	You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	5292	I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	5293	I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	5294	But they know what's going on.	0
ClaimBuster	5295	They look at our -- our decision to -- to cut back on our military capabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	5296	I've been to these national parks.	1
ClaimBuster	5297	We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there.	1
ClaimBuster	5298	No one else believes that's the case.	0
ClaimBuster	5299	I'm really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	5300	The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.	0
ClaimBuster	5301	We're not giving this away for nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	5302	You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.	0
ClaimBuster	5303	And one of the things I've tried hardest to do is to tell the American people that we have to get beyond that, we have to understand that we're stronger when we unite around shared values instead of being divided by our differences.	0
ClaimBuster	5304	More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force.	1
ClaimBuster	5305	And what I'm afraid of is we've watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we'll let the U.N. deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	5306	I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth.	0
ClaimBuster	5307	But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	5308	There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.	1
ClaimBuster	5309	If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4,000 out-of-pocket.	1
ClaimBuster	5310	And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	5311	I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they're rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there.	1
ClaimBuster	5312	I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	5313	They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	5314	And now we are putting up a defense of our own.	1
ClaimBuster	5315	But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5316	You've been president four years.	1
ClaimBuster	5317	As you notice, he starts talking about government.	1
ClaimBuster	5318	If you care about it, why don't you veto it?	0
ClaimBuster	5319	It is about what's happening right now in America.	0
ClaimBuster	5320	The Bureau of Labor Statistics today said they made a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	5321	They would know all about our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	5322	That bill did -- there was another bill that did die in committee.	1
ClaimBuster	5323	It's wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	5324	And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association.	1
ClaimBuster	5325	We've turned it into a weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	5326	But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust.	0
ClaimBuster	5327	I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, let's come together.	0
ClaimBuster	5328	Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	5329	Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments.	1
ClaimBuster	5330	He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.	1
ClaimBuster	5331	Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price.	1
ClaimBuster	5332	I believe in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	5333	But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.	0
ClaimBuster	5334	I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.	0
ClaimBuster	5335	"""No, we're spending your money."	1
ClaimBuster	5336	It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II.	0
ClaimBuster	5337	He put forward No Child Left Behind.	1
ClaimBuster	5338	But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.	0
ClaimBuster	5339	Well, it's awful easy when you're dealing with 90-90 hindsight.	0
ClaimBuster	5340	I'm sorry that we couldn't persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates.	1
ClaimBuster	5341	And so, I would pick people that would be strict constructionists.	0
ClaimBuster	5342	And it's now the smallest number that we have had since the -- the smallest in size since John Kennedy's administration.	1
ClaimBuster	5343	But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	5344	- reducing the interest rate.	0
ClaimBuster	5345	You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.	0
ClaimBuster	5346	And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.	0
ClaimBuster	5347	Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	5348	The Nationalists have these two islands.	1
ClaimBuster	5349	I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America.	0
ClaimBuster	5350	They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan.	1
ClaimBuster	5351	And the people who have jobs --	0
ClaimBuster	5352	What's he say to Tony Blair?	0
ClaimBuster	5353	Free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people.	0
ClaimBuster	5354	I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.	0
ClaimBuster	5355	It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	5356	And we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.	1
ClaimBuster	5357	I think we're making progress here.	0
ClaimBuster	5358	The stock market was declining six months prior to my arrival.	1
ClaimBuster	5359	As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.	0
ClaimBuster	5360	The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military.	1
ClaimBuster	5361	And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.	0
ClaimBuster	5362	Let's get on with it.	0
ClaimBuster	5363	If affirmative action means what I just described what I'm for, then I'm for it.	0
ClaimBuster	5364	Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.	0
ClaimBuster	5365	And I'm very very proud of that choice.	0
ClaimBuster	5366	And of course, this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the USS Cole is on our minds and hearts and insofar as the memorial service is tomorrow, I would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing, and the injured.	1
ClaimBuster	5367	And domestic sources that are cleaner and better.	0
ClaimBuster	5368	I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.	0
ClaimBuster	5369	We haven't been doing enough of that.	0
ClaimBuster	5370	We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	5371	That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	5372	We're cutting taxes for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	5373	That is what it is.	0
ClaimBuster	5374	Now, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy -- very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation -- but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	5375	And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense.	0
ClaimBuster	5376	Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.	1
ClaimBuster	5377	That's been his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	5378	See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.	0
ClaimBuster	5379	We might have to do it slowly.	0
ClaimBuster	5380	You bet there's things that government can do.	0
ClaimBuster	5381	One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.	0
ClaimBuster	5382	And so, the plan he talks about simply won't work.	0
ClaimBuster	5383	That is absolutely not true.	0
ClaimBuster	5384	It's driven by, what are we going to need to keep the American people safe?	0
ClaimBuster	5385	Can you add five seconds, Bernie, out of fairness?	0
ClaimBuster	5386	Making sure we've got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read.	0
ClaimBuster	5387	I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	5388	My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement.	1
ClaimBuster	5389	Why do we have a depletion allowance?	0
ClaimBuster	5390	But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school there's Pell Grants available for them, which is what we've done.	0
ClaimBuster	5391	And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	5392	In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	5393	Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.	0
ClaimBuster	5394	We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people.	0
ClaimBuster	5395	If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt.	1
ClaimBuster	5396	My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	5397	See, I don't believe any other country can pick up the mantel.	0
ClaimBuster	5398	New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	5399	You can't have kids coming out of college, half of them can't find a job today, or a job that's commensurate with their college degree.	1
ClaimBuster	5400	To get it, to get $150 billion in new taxes, you got to go down to the guy that's making $36,600.	0
ClaimBuster	5401	But he's in the arena.	0
ClaimBuster	5402	I have number 1 and 1A.	1
ClaimBuster	5403	These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.	0
ClaimBuster	5404	Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.	1
ClaimBuster	5405	But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.	0
ClaimBuster	5406	I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	5407	And some domestic programs as well, Andrea.	0
ClaimBuster	5408	Four thousand people a day are coming across the border.	1
ClaimBuster	5409	After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing.	1
ClaimBuster	5410	I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.	0
ClaimBuster	5411	The president says I've changed my mind.	1
ClaimBuster	5412	I don't see how you can lead troops if you say it's the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.	0
ClaimBuster	5413	And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.	1
ClaimBuster	5414	You cannot make concessions to terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	5415	Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	5416	But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	5417	Thirty years ago there were three police officers on the street for every crime; today there are three crimes for every police officer.	1
ClaimBuster	5418	What we need is people to stop talking and start doing.	0
ClaimBuster	5419	I mean, we can remember when President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis sent his secretary of state to Paris to meet with DeGaulle.	1
ClaimBuster	5420	And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1.6 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	5421	We weren't guaranteeing anything, anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it.	0
ClaimBuster	5422	I know what it's like to be in a hospital.	0
ClaimBuster	5423	Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill.	1
ClaimBuster	5424	It's sort of their golden oldie, you know.	0
ClaimBuster	5425	Let me tell you what I√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ll do.	0
ClaimBuster	5426	In fact, they have got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options they will present to the next Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	5427	This is an essential that we get it right.	0
ClaimBuster	5428	It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015.	0
ClaimBuster	5429	"He said, ""The buck stops here.''"	1
ClaimBuster	5430	It's our job to fix the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	5431	I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.	0
ClaimBuster	5432	The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners.	0
ClaimBuster	5433	We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.	0
ClaimBuster	5434	They get $25,000 a year income, that makes them ineligible.	1
ClaimBuster	5435	And then came some other program, and then came healthcare, and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed, and I think we've done a good job.	0
ClaimBuster	5436	We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	5437	The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.	0
ClaimBuster	5438	Have you looked at your pension?	0
ClaimBuster	5439	The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.	1
ClaimBuster	5440	The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	5441	Pretty divided in the 2000 election.	0
ClaimBuster	5442	We also have seen Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public.	1
ClaimBuster	5443	We'll lose it when it's taken out of our paycheck before we even get it.	0
ClaimBuster	5444	But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.	1
ClaimBuster	5445	But the policies he's put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have.	1
ClaimBuster	5446	I think at the time, the mistake that was made was signing off on the deal late on Saturday night in the middle of the night.	0
ClaimBuster	5447	I want think they want somebody with common sense who can do what's best for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	5448	They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that.	0
ClaimBuster	5449	We have elections so people can make decisions about this.	0
ClaimBuster	5450	If they just left the Clean Air Act all alone the way it is today, no change, the air would be cleaner than it is if you pass the Clear Skies act.	0
ClaimBuster	5451	The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.	1
ClaimBuster	5452	And the main reason we'll succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free.	0
ClaimBuster	5453	Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?	0
ClaimBuster	5454	We had a guarantee on the S&Ls, right?	0
ClaimBuster	5455	Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.	0
ClaimBuster	5456	So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them.	0
ClaimBuster	5457	What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	5458	The facts are, there - the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh - at a low level.	1
ClaimBuster	5459	They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15.	1
ClaimBuster	5460	And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.	0
ClaimBuster	5461	The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.	1
ClaimBuster	5462	He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion.	1
ClaimBuster	5463	That is the central issue of our time.	0
ClaimBuster	5464	Well, the difference is is that I can get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	5465	And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.	0
ClaimBuster	5466	The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...	1
ClaimBuster	5467	And he's trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind.	0
ClaimBuster	5468	That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly.	0
ClaimBuster	5469	But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.	0
ClaimBuster	5470	The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.	1
ClaimBuster	5471	So what does he do?	0
ClaimBuster	5472	Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make.	1
ClaimBuster	5473	You know, Elizabeth, I really respect your -- the feeling that's in your question.	0
ClaimBuster	5474	It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	5475	So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	5476	You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.	1
ClaimBuster	5477	There are 900 sequestered in the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	5478	Capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it 28 percent to 14 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	5479	...that's a -- I indicated...	0
ClaimBuster	5480	I think he said that Israel was a - a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire.	1
ClaimBuster	5481	But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.	1
ClaimBuster	5482	The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is.	1
ClaimBuster	5483	We don't have free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	5484	We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment.	1
ClaimBuster	5485	We've added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months.	1
ClaimBuster	5486	I'm no longer a public official.	1
ClaimBuster	5487	We got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way.	0
ClaimBuster	5488	They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	5489	Why, when you said you'd filed legislation in your first year didn't you do it?	1
ClaimBuster	5490	These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and I'm not going to do it that way.	0
ClaimBuster	5491	In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.	1
ClaimBuster	5492	We cut taxes 19 times.	1
ClaimBuster	5493	"I have heard you say on one TV appearance, ""the media made me do it."""	1
ClaimBuster	5494	We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival.	0
ClaimBuster	5495	We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.	0
ClaimBuster	5496	At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.	1
ClaimBuster	5497	And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.	0
ClaimBuster	5498	We don't need to do that any more.	0
ClaimBuster	5499	We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5500	Let me -- let me complete...	0
ClaimBuster	5501	I just don't believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican convention.	0
ClaimBuster	5502	And at the end of that seven years we were engaged in a war in Korea which cost of thirty thousand American lives.	1
ClaimBuster	5503	I'm not some extremist out here.	0
ClaimBuster	5504	It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long.	0
ClaimBuster	5505	Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.	0
ClaimBuster	5506	To do that, we're taking back jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	5507	This is a very important country to us.	0
ClaimBuster	5508	I think there's a great difference between the Government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel, and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on.	0
ClaimBuster	5509	The future of things that matter to you -- in terms of civil rights, what kind of Justice Department you'll have, whether we'll enforce the law.	0
ClaimBuster	5510	In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries.	1
ClaimBuster	5511	So if you're starting a business, where would you rather start it?	0
ClaimBuster	5512	That's true of any family.	0
ClaimBuster	5513	That was a tax credit for the employer.	1
ClaimBuster	5514	As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	5515	And you know what they said to us?	0
ClaimBuster	5516	You're going to get a tax relief in my plan.	0
ClaimBuster	5517	That's the best way to get people back in the system.	0
ClaimBuster	5518	We've got to have no more trickle down.	0
ClaimBuster	5519	"You'll virtually -- it's virtually impossible given our regulations."""	0
ClaimBuster	5520	And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.	1
ClaimBuster	5521	But we have enormous differences.	0
ClaimBuster	5522	I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.	0
ClaimBuster	5523	Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	5524	And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible.	0
ClaimBuster	5525	When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.	1
ClaimBuster	5526	So with all the talk about family values, I know about family values -- I wouldn't be here without them.	0
ClaimBuster	5527	Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done.	1
ClaimBuster	5528	I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy's advan- advice to go - go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did - said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists.	1
ClaimBuster	5529	I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing.	1
ClaimBuster	5530	We've mobilized sanctions against that government.	1
ClaimBuster	5531	There were some of us -- there were some of us that stood up against it.	1
ClaimBuster	5532	But, George, that's no answer.	0
ClaimBuster	5533	I care about our kids.	0
ClaimBuster	5534	I don't believe, uh - Mr. Frankel that uh - the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	5535	It was the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement signed by a president on behalf of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	5536	The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half.	1
ClaimBuster	5537	That's a classic example of a strategy that's embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	5538	I think the first one was related to uh - the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and uh - in the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	5539	And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race.	0
ClaimBuster	5540	That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause.	1
ClaimBuster	5541	Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?	0
ClaimBuster	5542	We convinced Libya to disarm.	1
ClaimBuster	5543	And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007.	0
ClaimBuster	5544	And I would just say that it seems to me that that's the way it ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	5545	We cannot continue to tell the American people that we're going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America.	0
ClaimBuster	5546	But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.	0
ClaimBuster	5547	She's worked on it longer than I have.	1
ClaimBuster	5548	I -- I want to invest in research.	0
ClaimBuster	5549	Well I think this Republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance.	0
ClaimBuster	5550	Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS.	0
ClaimBuster	5551	But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America's influence will grow.	0
ClaimBuster	5552	I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	5553	The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased.	1
ClaimBuster	5554	I want to keep our neighborhoods much, much better in terms of anti-crime, and that's why I would appoint judges that have a little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less for the criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	5555	That happened before you came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	5556	I don't have any policy against hiring anyone; whether it's lifestyle or whatever, we don't have any policy of that kind, never have had in my office or will we have in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	5557	But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	5558	You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were.	1
ClaimBuster	5559	Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture.	0
ClaimBuster	5560	When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- a billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	5561	Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.	1
ClaimBuster	5562	Is this any reason for complacency?	0
ClaimBuster	5563	Welfare reform is one way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	5564	It's ruled by a handful of tribes.	1
ClaimBuster	5565	I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.	0
ClaimBuster	5566	In fact, his environmental enforcement chief air-quality person at the EPA resigned in protest over what they're doing to what they are calling the new source performance standards for air quality.	1
ClaimBuster	5567	The time line that I've set out -- and again, I want to correct the president, because he's misled again this evening on what I've said.	0
ClaimBuster	5568	I have talked to Negro mothers.	1
ClaimBuster	5569	That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.	0
ClaimBuster	5570	Now we're changing to one conflict.	1
ClaimBuster	5571	Am I allowed to respond to that?	0
ClaimBuster	5572	The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	5573	That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.	1
ClaimBuster	5574	Of course I -- I don't know Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	5575	If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.	0
ClaimBuster	5576	I respect him for that.	0
ClaimBuster	5577	I think you can see that.	0
ClaimBuster	5578	She wants amnesty for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	5579	So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those.	0
ClaimBuster	5580	I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...	1
ClaimBuster	5581	Tipper and I have four children.	1
ClaimBuster	5582	It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better.	0
ClaimBuster	5583	Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed I believe that there should be a status of forces agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	5584	Now, the other superpowers need to do their part.	0
ClaimBuster	5585	And, above all, I want a nation that's strong.	0
ClaimBuster	5586	Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	5587	We can lend money but we have to do it wisely.	0
ClaimBuster	5588	Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement?	0
ClaimBuster	5589	We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.	0
ClaimBuster	5590	All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	5591	I was in Kyoto, and I was part of that.	1
ClaimBuster	5592	The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	5593	The Chinese Communists have always had a large population.	1
ClaimBuster	5594	What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength.	0
ClaimBuster	5595	We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company's money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.	0
ClaimBuster	5596	I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	5597	What explains this administration cozying up to the Argentine dictators after they took over?	0
ClaimBuster	5598	We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	5599	Is our strength and prestige rising?	0
ClaimBuster	5600	It broke my heart to go to the flood scene in Del Rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted.	1
ClaimBuster	5601	It doesn't work that way when you're president.	0
ClaimBuster	5602	And I know it's been going on a long time.	0
ClaimBuster	5603	He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses.	1
ClaimBuster	5604	Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.	1
ClaimBuster	5605	We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time.	0
ClaimBuster	5606	You know, it's just not that simple.	0
ClaimBuster	5607	I've got no illusions about that.	0
ClaimBuster	5608	So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	5609	It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	5610	You have -- wait a minute.	0
ClaimBuster	5611	If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	5612	If you vote one way you will have an expansion of family leave.	0
ClaimBuster	5613	Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.	1
ClaimBuster	5614	But he raised the question of my father and said, well, your father, Prescott Bush, was against McCarthy, you should be ashamed of yourself, McCarthyism.	1
ClaimBuster	5615	On the domestic side, what we must do is have change that empowers people -- not change for the sake of change, tax and spend.	0
ClaimBuster	5616	The people I talked to their spirits were high.	0
ClaimBuster	5617	One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other is James Schlesinger, whom I think you accompanied to uh - China.	1
ClaimBuster	5618	Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.	0
ClaimBuster	5619	And my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what's right, what's wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	5620	I'm absolutely, adamently opposed to that.	0
ClaimBuster	5621	And when they have a --they a --deals that are good for us, as China started to do--the changes in China since Barbara and I lived there is absolutely amazing, in terms of incentive, in partnership and things of this nature.	0
ClaimBuster	5622	It's a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	5623	Of course he's not, but he's not gonna be better off if we grow the government, if we invest, as Governor Clinton says, invest in more government.	0
ClaimBuster	5624	Now, if you break it, you made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	5625	The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.	1
ClaimBuster	5626	The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now.	0
ClaimBuster	5627	Well, we'll include it in that.	0
ClaimBuster	5628	So I don't believe that the fact you've got that long resume or had that experience is the real question.	0
ClaimBuster	5629	And the reason, one of the major reasons why we're in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	5630	It's naive and dangerous to say that.	0
ClaimBuster	5631	And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	1
ClaimBuster	5632	And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	5633	Different people with different views fight with each other.	0
ClaimBuster	5634	What he's asking me is, will I have a litmus test for my judges?	1
ClaimBuster	5635	They haven't said what's going to happen, whether they're going to have it declared addictive.	1
ClaimBuster	5636	You learn a lot from financial disclosure.	0
ClaimBuster	5637	One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people.	0
ClaimBuster	5638	Civilians get onto aircraft, and their luggage is X-rayed, but the cargo hold is not X- rayed.	1
ClaimBuster	5639	I think that we ought to make all schools gun free.	0
ClaimBuster	5640	I've said that I agree with the Administration policy.	1
ClaimBuster	5641	How do we pay for it?	0
ClaimBuster	5642	I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.	0
ClaimBuster	5643	And our country has no idea.	0
ClaimBuster	5644	I think it's always a tragic situation.	0
ClaimBuster	5645	I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it's nowhere near enough.	0
ClaimBuster	5646	And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.	0
ClaimBuster	5647	If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea.	0
ClaimBuster	5648	Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.	1
ClaimBuster	5649	I've appointed over 130, so I have a record.	1
ClaimBuster	5650	In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate.	1
ClaimBuster	5651	In both cases where they've done so, there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.	1
ClaimBuster	5652	What I cared about is could we work together.	0
ClaimBuster	5653	Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.	1
ClaimBuster	5654	Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	5655	How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?	0
ClaimBuster	5656	These two islands are in the area of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	5657	So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.	0
ClaimBuster	5658	That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	5659	This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.	0
ClaimBuster	5660	And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass.	1
ClaimBuster	5661	His chief education adviser is in jail He's in jail because he betrayed the public trust.	1
ClaimBuster	5662	We have a good housing program, uh - that uh - will result in cutting uh - the down payments by 50 percent and uh - having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period.	0
ClaimBuster	5663	One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong.	1
ClaimBuster	5664	It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	5665	We don't know who the rebels are.	0
ClaimBuster	5666	I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.	0
ClaimBuster	5667	What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.	0
ClaimBuster	5668	We are the one that worked out the prison labor deal.	1
ClaimBuster	5669	That's the kind of leadership that we need to show.	0
ClaimBuster	5670	But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that	1
ClaimBuster	5671	And I want to tell you what I tell them.	0
ClaimBuster	5672	We talk about the unemployment lines.	0
ClaimBuster	5673	Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	5674	I want to say, since this is the last time I'll be on a platform with my opponents, that even though I disagree with Mr. Perot on how fast we can reduce the deficit and how much we can increase taxes on the middle class, I really respect what he's done in this campaign to bring the issue of deficit reduction to our attention.	0
ClaimBuster	5675	Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.	0
ClaimBuster	5676	And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle.	1
ClaimBuster	5677	But the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	5678	All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.	0
ClaimBuster	5679	In New Hampshire Senator Kerrey said you ought to level, you ought to tell the truth about it.	1
ClaimBuster	5680	You know, it's hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	5681	If you make it as a young man, time passes.	0
ClaimBuster	5682	I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force.	0
ClaimBuster	5683	And if we don't, we will be spending our children's money.	0
ClaimBuster	5684	And I noted that nobody was really benefitting except a very small group at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	5685	We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.	0
ClaimBuster	5686	Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth.	0
ClaimBuster	5687	We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesn't hide.	0
ClaimBuster	5688	Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	5689	And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.	0
ClaimBuster	5690	It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.	0
ClaimBuster	5691	The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million.	1
ClaimBuster	5692	We have lost over 4,000 lives.	1
ClaimBuster	5693	I don't see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place.	0
ClaimBuster	5694	You need small schools, not big schools.	0
ClaimBuster	5695	"I remember sitting in the White House looking at those generals, saying, ""Do you have what you need in this war?"	0
ClaimBuster	5696	Now, with respect to immigration reform, the president broke his promise on immigration reform.	1
ClaimBuster	5697	Well, my rebuttal is I've heard the national debt blamed for a lot of things, but not for illegal immigration across our border -- [laughter] -- and it has nothing to do with it.	0
ClaimBuster	5698	Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	5699	If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right.	1
ClaimBuster	5700	I mean, look at it, and that's what we're asking America to have?	0
ClaimBuster	5701	Can any American looking at the situation in Latin America feel contented with what's happening today, when a candidate for the presidency of Brazil feels it necessary to call - not on Washington during the campaign - but on Castro in Havana, in order to pick up the support of the Castro supporters in Brazil?	0
ClaimBuster	5702	That's how you create jobs and become competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	5703	I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	5704	"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?"	0
ClaimBuster	5705	I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry.	0
ClaimBuster	5706	That's not what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	5707	So we always had a rule, we divided by six.	1
ClaimBuster	5708	America can help that happen.	0
ClaimBuster	5709	How do you miss $6 billion?	0
ClaimBuster	5710	Incomes are rising for the first time in a decade, the crime rates, the welfare rolls are falling, we're putting , 100,000 more police on the street.	1
ClaimBuster	5711	In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican - I can't under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the - Eastern Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	5712	And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter.	0
ClaimBuster	5713	You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni.	1
ClaimBuster	5714	It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country.	0
ClaimBuster	5715	It's sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act and said to certain stores, okay, you have to make it accessible to people in wheelchairs.	1
ClaimBuster	5716	Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety.	0
ClaimBuster	5717	The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	5718	Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party.	1
ClaimBuster	5719	Uh - the polls uh - are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another.	1
ClaimBuster	5720	But the next President of the United States will have to make some tough and difficult decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	5721	And so you saw ten grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the convention.	1
ClaimBuster	5722	I think it's a cynicism in Washington and it doesn't have to be that way.	0
ClaimBuster	5723	We can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away.	0
ClaimBuster	5724	But we're providing health care for our people.	1
ClaimBuster	5725	It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns.	1
ClaimBuster	5726	He said I misled on Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	5727	I differ with the 2 here on that.	1
ClaimBuster	5728	And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.	1
ClaimBuster	5729	There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 211/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.	1
ClaimBuster	5730	We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.	0
ClaimBuster	5731	And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction.	1
ClaimBuster	5732	I think they're different because they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.	0
ClaimBuster	5733	You called it the gold standard.	1
ClaimBuster	5734	I would like a balanced budget amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	5735	We're doing this all around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	5736	You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat.	1
ClaimBuster	5737	Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	5738	But the last point I want to make is this.	0
ClaimBuster	5739	I am for the right, as the governor says- -I'm a sportsman and I don't think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	5740	And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.	0
ClaimBuster	5741	That's been displayed again and again in a very tangible way.	1
ClaimBuster	5742	Particularly some of the smaller producers.	0
ClaimBuster	5743	I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America.	0
ClaimBuster	5744	And it wasn't very detailed.	0
ClaimBuster	5745	What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?	0
ClaimBuster	5746	You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that -- that would make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	5747	Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.	1
ClaimBuster	5748	"I knew it wouldn't work."""	0
ClaimBuster	5749	We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	5750	And three of those checks were my grandparents'.	1
ClaimBuster	5751	And it's not an easy problem to solve.	0
ClaimBuster	5752	I know that some churches do.	0
ClaimBuster	5753	The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	5754	Now looking at Senator Kennedy's credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will.	0
ClaimBuster	5755	But to say that there's only one focus on the war on terror doesn't really understand the nature of the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	5756	What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	5757	And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	5758	Let me uh - speak out very strongly.	0
ClaimBuster	5759	And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I don't.	0
ClaimBuster	5760	Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it or saying you can get across yourself?	0
ClaimBuster	5761	I don't think they do, enough.	0
ClaimBuster	5762	I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates.	0
ClaimBuster	5763	We know that the path we're taking is not working.	0
ClaimBuster	5764	When the audit's complete, I'll do it.	0
ClaimBuster	5765	And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.	0
ClaimBuster	5766	The US is doing better than a lot.	1
ClaimBuster	5767	If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China.	0
ClaimBuster	5768	The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	5769	And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.	0
ClaimBuster	5770	It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	5771	Why didn't she do something about it?	0
ClaimBuster	5772	We need a $2,000 credit, rebate for people, working people that don't have insurance, they can get in the marketplace and start purchasing insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	5773	It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.	1
ClaimBuster	5774	Some of them had been there before.	1
ClaimBuster	5775	I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.	0
ClaimBuster	5776	And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way.	0
ClaimBuster	5777	People out there listening know what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	5778	In the last debate,1 (FOOTNOTE) the Vice President of the United States said that I said the marines had died shamefully and died in shame in Lebanon.	1
ClaimBuster	5779	This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there.	0
ClaimBuster	5780	And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.	1
ClaimBuster	5781	Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	5782	And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American.	0
ClaimBuster	5783	And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.	0
ClaimBuster	5784	Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools.	0
ClaimBuster	5785	The first thing I'd do is, during political campaigns, I would urge everybody to stop trying to split this country into fragments and appeal to the differences between us and then wonder why the melting pot is all broken to pieces after November the 3rd.	0
ClaimBuster	5786	A $25 billion giveaway to the biggest corporations in America, including a $254 million refund check to Enron.	1
ClaimBuster	5787	It's a totally different point of view.	0
ClaimBuster	5788	The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	5789	So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation.	0
ClaimBuster	5790	Because again this showed a lack of understanding of dictators, a lack of understanding particularly of Communists, because every time you make such a concession it does not lead to peace; it only encourages them to blackmail you.	0
ClaimBuster	5791	They've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.	1
ClaimBuster	5792	... about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.	1
ClaimBuster	5793	Clearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it.	1
ClaimBuster	5794	The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	5795	We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.	1
ClaimBuster	5796	I'm optimistic that we'll win the war on terror, but I understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	5797	So racial profiling isn't just an issue at local police forces.	0
ClaimBuster	5798	But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.	1
ClaimBuster	5799	We've been strong, but we haven't been trigger-happy.	0
ClaimBuster	5800	Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.	0
ClaimBuster	5801	The Patriot Act is vital -- is vital that the Congress renew the Patriot Act which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terror cells.	0
ClaimBuster	5802	But I'm going to be respectful for people, I'll tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people.	0
ClaimBuster	5803	National security, economic strength, democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	5804	They don't want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47.	0
ClaimBuster	5805	A guy named Michael runs the school.	1
ClaimBuster	5806	You heard what I was for.	0
ClaimBuster	5807	Now under my plan we'll balance the budget every year.	0
ClaimBuster	5808	But let's take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and that's our education policy.	0
ClaimBuster	5809	Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.	0
ClaimBuster	5810	And are you prepared to repudiate him now?	0
ClaimBuster	5811	That's just not true, John.	0
ClaimBuster	5812	What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East?	0
ClaimBuster	5813	They viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country.	0
ClaimBuster	5814	We do not want to be the lowest of the low.	0
ClaimBuster	5815	I know nothing about Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	5816	I have never suggested a test where we turn over our security to any nation.	1
ClaimBuster	5817	Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there.	0
ClaimBuster	5818	I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi-scare.	0
ClaimBuster	5819	I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.	1
ClaimBuster	5820	Now, typically, what's happened is that there's been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.	0
ClaimBuster	5821	And I wouldn't join it.	0
ClaimBuster	5822	But we can't do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country.	0
ClaimBuster	5823	And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.	1
ClaimBuster	5824	I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.	0
ClaimBuster	5825	I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	5826	There are some really interesting technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	5827	Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.	1
ClaimBuster	5828	And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately what's going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	5829	And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.	1
ClaimBuster	5830	And that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	5831	I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending.	0
ClaimBuster	5832	What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights - commercial air flights - to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of air planes, or the harboring of hijackers.	1
ClaimBuster	5833	And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.	0
ClaimBuster	5834	And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.	0
ClaimBuster	5835	Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya.	1
ClaimBuster	5836	The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors.	1
ClaimBuster	5837	It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations.	0
ClaimBuster	5838	And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.	0
ClaimBuster	5839	That's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	5840	Now we have a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	5841	And I'm blessed, as I think the president is blessed, as I said last time.	0
ClaimBuster	5842	That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	5843	I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks.	0
ClaimBuster	5844	His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents.	0
ClaimBuster	5845	Let's look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations.	0
ClaimBuster	5846	The Soviet Union is making great gains.	0
ClaimBuster	5847	But let's not go back and keep assailing a farm bill that passed with overwhelming Democrat and Republican support.	1
ClaimBuster	5848	That was the second time.	1
ClaimBuster	5849	Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad.	1
ClaimBuster	5850	I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it.	1
ClaimBuster	5851	I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let's stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus.	0
ClaimBuster	5852	And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	5853	Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	5854	Our Navy is old -- excuse me, our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.	1
ClaimBuster	5855	My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	5856	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesn't support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	5857	And he was given a chance to vote, and he voted no.	1
ClaimBuster	5858	The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies.	1
ClaimBuster	5859	Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.	1
ClaimBuster	5860	And I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are.	0
ClaimBuster	5861	But the Americans with Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the most foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times, and so we do have something more than a technical problem.	0
ClaimBuster	5862	There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education.	1
ClaimBuster	5863	I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	5864	"The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for ""lighting and site selection."""	1
ClaimBuster	5865	We need to move on.	0
ClaimBuster	5866	And that's what we're going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	5867	You don't have good community relations in Chicago.	0
ClaimBuster	5868	I'm a Catholic, raised a Catholic.	1
ClaimBuster	5869	We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible.	0
ClaimBuster	5870	"This is the person who, after we had -- we hadn't even finished Afghanistan, where he said, ""Next up, Baghdad."""	1
ClaimBuster	5871	Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.	0
ClaimBuster	5872	Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	5873	These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism.	0
ClaimBuster	5874	That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	5875	China can be our partner, but -- but that doesn't mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis.	0
ClaimBuster	5876	In other words, trading with other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	5877	But I think they're going to see through it.	0
ClaimBuster	5878	He came to see me.	1
ClaimBuster	5879	And so, what I'm telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think they're right.	0
ClaimBuster	5880	I have a feeling how they came.	0
ClaimBuster	5881	I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	5882	Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut.	1
ClaimBuster	5883	Well, I have much better judgment than she does.	0
ClaimBuster	5884	I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way.	0
ClaimBuster	5885	And we've got to maintain that pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	5886	Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history.	0
ClaimBuster	5887	But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal.	1
ClaimBuster	5888	The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission.	1
ClaimBuster	5889	The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.	1
ClaimBuster	5890	Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not true what he said.	1
ClaimBuster	5891	I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don't want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out.	0
ClaimBuster	5892	It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.	0
ClaimBuster	5893	In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.	0
ClaimBuster	5894	Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion.	1
ClaimBuster	5895	We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.	0
ClaimBuster	5896	We just heard the President's answer for the problems at the barracks in Lebanon, where 241 marines were killed.	1
ClaimBuster	5897	At home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.	0
ClaimBuster	5898	Look -- look, it's not that hard to fix Social Security, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	5899	And then I think of the older people who are retired.	0
ClaimBuster	5900	The president got $84 from a timber company that owns, and he's counted as a small business.	1
ClaimBuster	5901	You know, I am grateful to all of you for giving me the opportunity to serve you for these 4 years, and I seek reelection because I want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we charted 4 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	5902	It was the largest stock market correction -- one of the largest in history, which foretold a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	5903	They fought and won World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	5904	They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.	0
ClaimBuster	5905	We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	5906	I'll get America and North America energy independent.	0
ClaimBuster	5907	We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny.	0
ClaimBuster	5908	But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.	0
ClaimBuster	5909	I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.	0
ClaimBuster	5910	But the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors.	0
ClaimBuster	5911	And number three, we need to be a force for freedom and democracy and we need to use our unique position to support freedom, whether it's in Haiti or in China or in any other place, wherever the seeds of freedom are sprouting.	0
ClaimBuster	5912	There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records.	1
ClaimBuster	5913	You've got to look at our record.	0
ClaimBuster	5914	Well, listen, you ought to be in the White House for a day and hear what I hear and see what I see and read the mail I read and touch the people that I touch from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	5915	You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	5916	I don't know about -- we'll talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.	0
ClaimBuster	5917	It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	5918	What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something.	1
ClaimBuster	5919	We cannot have it in our hearts.	0
ClaimBuster	5920	I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.	0
ClaimBuster	5921	The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church.	0
ClaimBuster	5922	And the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress.	1
ClaimBuster	5923	We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, you can take the northern part of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	5924	I've watched him with the first lady, who I admire a great deal, and his daughters.	1
ClaimBuster	5925	My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3.4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years.	1
ClaimBuster	5926	And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation.	0
ClaimBuster	5927	You can't have voluntary testing.	0
ClaimBuster	5928	Ones that can support a family.	0
ClaimBuster	5929	We've negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.	1
ClaimBuster	5930	Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government?	0
ClaimBuster	5931	Anybody that's ever built a successful business will tell you you optimize, optimize, optimize after you've put something into effect.	0
ClaimBuster	5932	He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.	1
ClaimBuster	5933	That's the enemy that attacked us.	1
ClaimBuster	5934	And we have a certain disproportionate responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	5935	That's why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua.	0
ClaimBuster	5936	That's what I want to focus on.	0
ClaimBuster	5937	I will defend Planned Parenthood.	0
ClaimBuster	5938	Didn't bring in enough nation.	0
ClaimBuster	5939	He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for - which he did - that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment - and on this particular - or for an amendment, I should say - which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve.	1
ClaimBuster	5940	First, as a legislative leader.	0
ClaimBuster	5941	So there's some bad things going on.	0
ClaimBuster	5942	Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982.	1
ClaimBuster	5943	Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years?	0
ClaimBuster	5944	These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache.	1
ClaimBuster	5945	You can't have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate.	0
ClaimBuster	5946	I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.	0
ClaimBuster	5947	My opponent calls it a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	5948	Sure, you can do that with Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	5949	Did you say you're unemployed?	0
ClaimBuster	5950	Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	5951	We've been successful in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	5952	We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.	0
ClaimBuster	5953	Maybe the Vice President has an answer.	0
ClaimBuster	5954	Katie, it's a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	5955	This is a group of killers who will not only kill here, but kill children in Russia, that'll attack unmercifully in Iraq, hoping to shake our will.	0
ClaimBuster	5956	I wrote about that in...	0
ClaimBuster	5957	Well, I'm a little confused here, because I don't see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	5958	And then fourthly, as a moral leader.	0
ClaimBuster	5959	I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person.	0
ClaimBuster	5960	Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.	0
ClaimBuster	5961	... who initiated -- actually, supports charters.	0
ClaimBuster	5962	He says that he voted for the resolution.	1
ClaimBuster	5963	It was a smart thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	5964	Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didn't want me to sign any bill at all, but I had thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits, but they wouldn't make some of the changes that I thought should be made.	0
ClaimBuster	5965	It is important for NATO to have it work.	0
ClaimBuster	5966	I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.	0
ClaimBuster	5967	We never should go back to that.	0
ClaimBuster	5968	I notice that Mr. Ford didn't comment on the uh - prisons in Chile.	0
ClaimBuster	5969	But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime.	0
ClaimBuster	5970	Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	5971	Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions.	0
ClaimBuster	5972	But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.	0
ClaimBuster	5973	He just brought up the tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	5974	What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	5975	But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.	0
ClaimBuster	5976	I believe we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil.	0
ClaimBuster	5977	You know, I -- I don't look at my pension.	0
ClaimBuster	5978	Now you judge for yourselves whether or not that's fair.	0
ClaimBuster	5979	And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	5980	We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn't stay there.	0
ClaimBuster	5981	Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.	1
ClaimBuster	5982	And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited.	0
ClaimBuster	5983	John McCain is for me for president because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	5984	I didn't get to make a comment on this.	1
ClaimBuster	5985	As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the -- the insurgents are highly disparate.	0
ClaimBuster	5986	That's where we ought to go, and those are the programs we ought to review first.	0
ClaimBuster	5987	In fact, Senator McCain's campaign chairman's firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me.	1
ClaimBuster	5988	I went to Yad Beshef (ph), the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.	1
ClaimBuster	5989	She doesn't get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	5990	Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.	0
ClaimBuster	5991	On non - nu- oh - uh - nonproliferation, in May of l975, I called for a conference of uh - nuclear suppliers.	1
ClaimBuster	5992	Let me say, if Senator Dole mentioned this, I just signed a bill that we got through Congress to increase the amount of pay increase we could give for military personnel and to make sure the pay increase this year was above the rate of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	5993	But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability.	0
ClaimBuster	5994	He should have answered the first question.	0
ClaimBuster	5995	You know, he talks to the workers.	1
ClaimBuster	5996	Now we've been hurt in recent years in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	5997	We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.	1
ClaimBuster	5998	And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	5999	And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors.	0
ClaimBuster	6000	That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.	1
ClaimBuster	6001	And we've got a wide array of differences on those.	0
ClaimBuster	6002	So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	6003	We need a strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	6004	Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	6005	If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given -- President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America -- just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075.	1
ClaimBuster	6006	I made that clear when I came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	6007	Mosul is a Sunni city.	1
ClaimBuster	6008	But I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack.	1
ClaimBuster	6009	But let me go a step further.	0
ClaimBuster	6010	But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	6011	He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.	1
ClaimBuster	6012	They're putting people out of business, men and women.	0
ClaimBuster	6013	Now with respect to what we've done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993.	1
ClaimBuster	6014	We cannot solve this problem all on our own.	0
ClaimBuster	6015	So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.	1
ClaimBuster	6016	I believe we could have done better.	0
ClaimBuster	6017	And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers.	0
ClaimBuster	6018	But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong.	0
ClaimBuster	6019	And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.	0
ClaimBuster	6020	One, could our family endure all this business.	0
ClaimBuster	6021	Not just a state problem.	0
ClaimBuster	6022	And I make that point because that's the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular.	1
ClaimBuster	6023	The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy.	1
ClaimBuster	6024	I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace.	0
ClaimBuster	6025	I promised that we would reduce taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	6026	Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.	1
ClaimBuster	6027	I have no idea what you're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	6028	I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield.	1
ClaimBuster	6029	In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	6030	They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.	0
ClaimBuster	6031	In addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve.	0
ClaimBuster	6032	But I know more about this, I think, than anybody else up here because I have a brother who's a recovering drug addict.	1
ClaimBuster	6033	I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.	0
ClaimBuster	6034	I talked in our first debate about the possibilities of helping millions and millions of welfare families to get off of welfare, and I'm proud to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill And the Ruby Samsons and Dan Lawsons, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers in this country and in my state and across the country who today are working and earning are examples of what can happen when you provide training to those welfare mothers, some daycare for their children so that those mothers can go into a training program and get a decent job.	1
ClaimBuster	6035	For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.	1
ClaimBuster	6036	So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.	0
ClaimBuster	6037	He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today.	1
ClaimBuster	6038	I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.	0
ClaimBuster	6039	If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.	0
ClaimBuster	6040	You also have investments in Chinese companies.	1
ClaimBuster	6041	If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	6042	Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.	0
ClaimBuster	6043	We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	6044	"I was chairman of ""Minnesotans for Kennedy;'' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called ""Democrats for Nixon.''"	1
ClaimBuster	6045	And secondly, like my opponent, I don't agree we ought to have quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	6046	So we want to end discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	6047	They're not taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	6048	And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6049	If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.	0
ClaimBuster	6050	He said it would hurt the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	6051	My fellow Americans, as you heard from Bob Schieffer a moment ago, America is being tested by division.	1
ClaimBuster	6052	I would be guarded in my approach.	0
ClaimBuster	6053	Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern.	1
ClaimBuster	6054	I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	6055	We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.	0
ClaimBuster	6056	And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it.	1
ClaimBuster	6057	And Iran is killing ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	6058	I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	6059	I am opposed to it.	0
ClaimBuster	6060	It's one of these deals where, in order to be popular in the halls of Europe, you sign a treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	6061	It's a big mistake to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6062	You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	6063	I looked the other night.	0
ClaimBuster	6064	I have my own plan.	0
ClaimBuster	6065	So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.	1
ClaimBuster	6066	He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	6067	I've already taken the pledge on cutting the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	6068	And now you've got a choice.	0
ClaimBuster	6069	Now, we have just heard two or three times from the vice president: he's not going to raise taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	6070	"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed."	0
ClaimBuster	6071	Maybe to Senator Obama it's not a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	6072	And let's talk about people we do control.	0
ClaimBuster	6073	As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China.	1
ClaimBuster	6074	This is an issue that -- look, it divides us.	0
ClaimBuster	6075	He made a mistake in invading Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	6076	Now we have a majority and we get a president.	1
ClaimBuster	6077	It's a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	6078	If you want me to be your president, we're going to face our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	6079	I mean, we agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	6080	The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it.	1
ClaimBuster	6081	It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.	0
ClaimBuster	6082	If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.	0
ClaimBuster	6083	Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report.	1
ClaimBuster	6084	We can do better in our public schools.	0
ClaimBuster	6085	They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests.	1
ClaimBuster	6086	I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.	0
ClaimBuster	6087	We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.	1
ClaimBuster	6088	If you want to purchase health insurance, you will get help with that.	0
ClaimBuster	6089	This is indeed a very important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	6090	And, believe me, anybody that knows me understands I have a very low tolerance for non-performance also.	0
ClaimBuster	6091	They told you at the tax and budget summit that if you agreed to a tax increase, we could balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	6092	Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed.	1
ClaimBuster	6093	Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	6094	I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	6095	I know what it takes to balance budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	6096	The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	6097	I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	6098	I never said any such thing.	1
ClaimBuster	6099	The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep.	0
ClaimBuster	6100	She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.	0
ClaimBuster	6101	Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis.	1
ClaimBuster	6102	So I think it's worth a shot.	0
ClaimBuster	6103	I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	6104	That's what we will do.	0
ClaimBuster	6105	I think our seniors deserve a modern medical system.	0
ClaimBuster	6106	We can further the cause of equality in our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	6107	Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University.	0
ClaimBuster	6108	You just give me a job.	0
ClaimBuster	6109	That's why I think we shouldn't do it that quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	6110	The fact of the matter is...	0
ClaimBuster	6111	We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.	0
ClaimBuster	6112	We're not talking about third-world drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	6113	In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%.	1
ClaimBuster	6114	Everything is a gift from the Almighty.	0
ClaimBuster	6115	In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making -- 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000.	1
ClaimBuster	6116	I've stood up against it as secretary of state.	1
ClaimBuster	6117	We've got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through.	0
ClaimBuster	6118	And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	6119	At that time, uh - 25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford.	1
ClaimBuster	6120	I've been waiting for years.	0
ClaimBuster	6121	And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	6122	I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are.	0
ClaimBuster	6123	Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected.	0
ClaimBuster	6124	"And we'll get you home as soon as the mission's done, because this is a vital mission."""	0
ClaimBuster	6125	But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at - at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president's terms being uh - the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh - entity with uh - with independence subject only to the president's veto.	0
ClaimBuster	6126	The fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	6127	My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank.	1
ClaimBuster	6128	But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations?	0
ClaimBuster	6129	They would have gone through a...	0
ClaimBuster	6130	The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.	0
ClaimBuster	6131	And the test is not whether you're spending more money.	0
ClaimBuster	6132	And it's not my money.	0
ClaimBuster	6133	I apologize, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	6134	We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.	0
ClaimBuster	6135	I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	6136	There are limits to this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems.	0
ClaimBuster	6137	So we want to promote those principles around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6138	You've got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	6139	And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	6140	And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.	0
ClaimBuster	6141	And it's really a shame.	0
ClaimBuster	6142	Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.	0
ClaimBuster	6143	Look, I look at what's happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb.	0
ClaimBuster	6144	Well, anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal.	0
ClaimBuster	6145	That's what worries me --	0
ClaimBuster	6146	And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home.	0
ClaimBuster	6147	I don't believe it is.	0
ClaimBuster	6148	So that's one reason I don't want it.	0
ClaimBuster	6149	And that's one of the reasons I've said before, and I'll pledge here tonight, if I'm president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill.	0
ClaimBuster	6150	I think after three debates the good people of this country understand there is a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	6151	That would be my position.	0
ClaimBuster	6152	But when there's uh - a very narrow decision - which quite often there's one that reaches the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	6153	For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	6154	And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen.	0
ClaimBuster	6155	That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	6156	And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.	0
ClaimBuster	6157	Now, having that, I think also that in leadership -- well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government.	0
ClaimBuster	6158	I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.	0
ClaimBuster	6159	OK, what -- what would I cut?	0
ClaimBuster	6160	On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions.	0
ClaimBuster	6161	I've got a plan to increase the wetlands by 3 million.	0
ClaimBuster	6162	And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down.	1
ClaimBuster	6163	This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that's what I had in mind.	1
ClaimBuster	6164	It must be a test of a man.	0
ClaimBuster	6165	His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing.	1
ClaimBuster	6166	That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	6167	There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	6168	And it was so far back, it was considered so odd, and even though we were a tiny, little company at the time, it made all the national magazines.	1
ClaimBuster	6169	The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	6170	The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education.	0
ClaimBuster	6171	I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrd's death.	1
ClaimBuster	6172	And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and he's earning less for himself and his family, while he's away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	6173	Anybody else can run the middle class down and run the economy in a ditch.	0
ClaimBuster	6174	You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it.	0
ClaimBuster	6175	It's been a very tough campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	6176	And we need to strengthen the American family.	0
ClaimBuster	6177	And let me say this.	0
ClaimBuster	6178	What are low paying jobs?	0
ClaimBuster	6179	So, I can say there are a great many interests.	0
ClaimBuster	6180	I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	6181	I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class.	0
ClaimBuster	6182	Now, I'm going to reverse that.	0
ClaimBuster	6183	The president's policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven't put Americans back to work.	1
ClaimBuster	6184	He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us.	1
ClaimBuster	6185	In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.	0
ClaimBuster	6186	And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time.	0
ClaimBuster	6187	Well, 88 percent of the people -- the President claims 11 million are already covered and only 5 percent -- keep in mind only 5 percent of the employers are affected by the Family Leave Act.	1
ClaimBuster	6188	Number two, we've got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.	1
ClaimBuster	6189	does, which is bulk purchase drugs so that you can lower the price and get them out to you lower.	0
ClaimBuster	6190	And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	6191	I think our relationships with China are important and I don't want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square.	0
ClaimBuster	6192	The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.	1
ClaimBuster	6193	It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful.	1
ClaimBuster	6194	Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it.	0
ClaimBuster	6195	-- me, or your own eyes?''	0
ClaimBuster	6196	I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.	1
ClaimBuster	6197	Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind.	0
ClaimBuster	6198	We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas.	0
ClaimBuster	6199	I'd like to be that leader with your support.	0
ClaimBuster	6200	I do not favor abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	6201	Senator Obama wants government to do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	6202	So I ask you to look at that.	0
ClaimBuster	6203	Well, it's the civil rights issue of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	6204	And a senator from Connecticut stood up to him named Prescott Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	6205	That's another reason to get the deficit down.	0
ClaimBuster	6206	I deal with them all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	6207	I thought that was a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	6208	Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	6209	It comes out of a general fund, but something should be done about it.	1
ClaimBuster	6210	And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.	0
ClaimBuster	6211	Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties.	0
ClaimBuster	6212	And that's why it's so critical, that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	6213	The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.	1
ClaimBuster	6214	And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?	0
ClaimBuster	6215	Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	6216	We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	6217	"So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says ""these are imaginary jobs."""	0
ClaimBuster	6218	And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	6219	As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.	0
ClaimBuster	6220	I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.	0
ClaimBuster	6221	And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.	1
ClaimBuster	6222	The George Bush who was the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the early '80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one we've been seeing and listening to the past two or three months.	1
ClaimBuster	6223	I hope as president that I've earned your trust.	0
ClaimBuster	6224	And I know that we did give back authority and autonomy to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	6225	We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... 	0
ClaimBuster	6226	And that is something that I would welcome.	0
ClaimBuster	6227	There is a huge difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	6228	He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop's store on the corner.	1
ClaimBuster	6229	I happen to support that.	1
ClaimBuster	6230	And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.	0
ClaimBuster	6231	And we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	6232	Japan will be hosting a summit.	1
ClaimBuster	6233	And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections.	1
ClaimBuster	6234	I understand the importance of time but see, here's how we get to this mess we're in.	0
ClaimBuster	6235	I believe, when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says.	0
ClaimBuster	6236	And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.	1
ClaimBuster	6237	I like those ratings systems.	0
ClaimBuster	6238	Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.	1
ClaimBuster	6239	The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	6240	Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace.	1
ClaimBuster	6241	That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.	1
ClaimBuster	6242	I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we're on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	6243	They're using text books that are 10 years old.	1
ClaimBuster	6244	Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy.	0
ClaimBuster	6245	He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan.	0
ClaimBuster	6246	And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.	0
ClaimBuster	6247	But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.	0
ClaimBuster	6248	I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.	0
ClaimBuster	6249	They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.	0
ClaimBuster	6250	One of the major errors they made was the one that led to the Korean War.	1
ClaimBuster	6251	They need to be tightened.	0
ClaimBuster	6252	Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?	0
ClaimBuster	6253	The President just said that his government is shrinking.	1
ClaimBuster	6254	And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of the Fallujahs and other places, and send the wrong message to the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	6255	And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.	0
ClaimBuster	6256	And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.	1
ClaimBuster	6257	And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.	0
ClaimBuster	6258	And it's named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn't bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it.	1
ClaimBuster	6259	Because China has an interest in the outcome, too.	0
ClaimBuster	6260	A President must know these things.	0
ClaimBuster	6261	Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families.	0
ClaimBuster	6262	Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6263	And I remember you gave a very good answer to New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place.	1
ClaimBuster	6264	Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.	0
ClaimBuster	6265	This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across -- let's take a family making $30,000 a year, that's $1261.	1
ClaimBuster	6266	It was ignored in that case and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	6267	Because we're able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadn't been tapped in the same way before.	0
ClaimBuster	6268	I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.	1
ClaimBuster	6269	We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.	1
ClaimBuster	6270	They used those weapons against -- against their own citizens and killed Americans with them.	1
ClaimBuster	6271	Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists.	0
ClaimBuster	6272	And that's what we ought to do for all people in America.	0
ClaimBuster	6273	Similarly, in Central America: What we're doing in Nicaragua with this covert war -- which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop -- is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest.	0
ClaimBuster	6274	The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong.	0
ClaimBuster	6275	And it wasn't until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you've got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	6276	We saw the same thing in Lebanon, where we spent a good deal of America's assets.	1
ClaimBuster	6277	I think that's been proven.	1
ClaimBuster	6278	Thank you very much, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	6279	Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	6280	What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	6281	He went over to say we must make the very changes they're making now.	0
ClaimBuster	6282	Now, my opponent says he's going to try to change the dynamics on the ground.	1
ClaimBuster	6283	The bad news is we lost.	0
ClaimBuster	6284	Between the World Trade Center bombing in, what was it, 1993 or so, and the next time was five years, seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	6285	"So I think even he has learned that you can't say ""read my lips"" because you can't know what emergencies might come up."	0
ClaimBuster	6286	If we tried everything else, if we have allies.	0
ClaimBuster	6287	I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health.	0
ClaimBuster	6288	He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.	1
ClaimBuster	6289	Ross gave a good answer but I've got to respond directly to Mr. Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	6290	I don't favor equal results, but I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove they're competent.	0
ClaimBuster	6291	You know, we have to be right 100 percent of the time.	0
ClaimBuster	6292	And she was forced to apologize.	1
ClaimBuster	6293	Barbara, you've asked that question twice.	1
ClaimBuster	6294	I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	6295	If we cut the capital gains rate, I'm told everyday, I had a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas, I can't, because the capital gains rate's too high.	1
ClaimBuster	6296	Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015.	1
ClaimBuster	6297	We are spending now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various types of programs than was spent in 1980.	1
ClaimBuster	6298	I don't think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	6299	So I get the last question -- last answer --	0
ClaimBuster	6300	Step one, the American people send me up there, the day after election, I'll get with congressional--we won't even wait till inauguration, and I'll ask the president to help me and I'll ask his staff to help me.	0
ClaimBuster	6301	I disagree with the tax-and-spend philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	6302	We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.	0
ClaimBuster	6303	You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	6304	It's as good as any private school in the country.	0
ClaimBuster	6305	You have to close the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	6306	Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	6307	We need a good strong economic package, let the private sector creates the jobs and they can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	6308	Uh - I remember when uh - Herbert Hoover was against uh - jobs for people.	1
ClaimBuster	6309	But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all.	0
ClaimBuster	6310	Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	6311	We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	6312	We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	6313	Why haven't they done it in seven years?	0
ClaimBuster	6314	We're not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	6315	And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.	0
ClaimBuster	6316	I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.	1
ClaimBuster	6317	The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them?	0
ClaimBuster	6318	Let me answer what he just said, about around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6319	Embryonic stem-cell research requires the destruction of life to create a stem cell.	1
ClaimBuster	6320	Yes, I've got scars to show for being around education reform.	0
ClaimBuster	6321	And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase.	0
ClaimBuster	6322	I want to cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	6323	My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are -- who get certified to teach in the areas where they're most needed.	1
ClaimBuster	6324	When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.	1
ClaimBuster	6325	No, it's going to totally help you.	0
ClaimBuster	6326	He said Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America.	1
ClaimBuster	6327	Well, let me just say quickly that I've had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation.	1
ClaimBuster	6328	Iran is taking over Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	6329	We are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition.	1
ClaimBuster	6330	My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.	0
ClaimBuster	6331	Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs.	0
ClaimBuster	6332	It's going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now.	0
ClaimBuster	6333	There are some very fundamental differences in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	6334	We can't have the industries of tomorrow unless we have the best educated workforce.	0
ClaimBuster	6335	And right now, they're in 32 countries.	1
ClaimBuster	6336	You say, how can I get Congress to do that?	0
ClaimBuster	6337	But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	6338	We had a recession in fifty-eight.	1
ClaimBuster	6339	And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding.	0
ClaimBuster	6340	And, finally, Medicaid to states?	0
ClaimBuster	6341	They tried it with Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy.	1
ClaimBuster	6342	But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	6343	I am part of an administration that has the finest record on diversity.	1
ClaimBuster	6344	And why don't we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones?	0
ClaimBuster	6345	Sure, absolutely, so long as they're based upon science and they're reasonable.	0
ClaimBuster	6346	How about the growth of the economy?	0
ClaimBuster	6347	And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	6348	It calls for more of the same.	0
ClaimBuster	6349	I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table.	1
ClaimBuster	6350	And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.	0
ClaimBuster	6351	It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest.	0
ClaimBuster	6352	I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations.	1
ClaimBuster	6353	Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home.	0
ClaimBuster	6354	If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn't be in the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	6355	The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that's good for our economic growth.	1
ClaimBuster	6356	So more debt and less jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	6357	Cutting 500,000 kids from after-school programs, cutting 365,000 kids from health care, running up the biggest deficits in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	6358	And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce.	1
ClaimBuster	6359	Because I think you see, I am one who I get kidded by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in public service.	0
ClaimBuster	6360	We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.	0
ClaimBuster	6361	We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.	1
ClaimBuster	6362	On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.	1
ClaimBuster	6363	The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three.	1
ClaimBuster	6364	And he rushed the war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	6365	So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.	1
ClaimBuster	6366	Now, if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, it's that agreement that's about to be put into practice.	0
ClaimBuster	6367	Hey, I'll answer the question.	0
ClaimBuster	6368	I want to talk about your responsibility, and your responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	6369	We're going to protect Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	6370	So you really owe him an apology.	0
ClaimBuster	6371	I'd like to see it expanded in two ways.	0
ClaimBuster	6372	Jim, Jim, this is a big...	0
ClaimBuster	6373	At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it'll take 13 years to get it.	0
ClaimBuster	6374	I offer a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	6375	It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours, that the last four years have been so hard.	0
ClaimBuster	6376	But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.	1
ClaimBuster	6377	And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation.	0
ClaimBuster	6378	And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.	0
ClaimBuster	6379	You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.	0
ClaimBuster	6380	He said we cut Pell Grants.	1
ClaimBuster	6381	We washed our hands of Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	6382	I do not want to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	6383	So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.	0
ClaimBuster	6384	The administration, seems like we're having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda.	0
ClaimBuster	6385	I really don't have -- haven't picked anybody yet.	0
ClaimBuster	6386	But let me talk about what's really important for the worker you're referring to.	0
ClaimBuster	6387	She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.	1
ClaimBuster	6388	And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also.	0
ClaimBuster	6389	Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.	1
ClaimBuster	6390	We are going to have to deal with energy because we can't keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia.	0
ClaimBuster	6391	We let families save in an IRA, withdraw tax free to pay for the cost of education and it's all paid for.	1
ClaimBuster	6392	I think that's an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decision-making process as opposed to a strict interpretation of the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	6393	I decided to go there myself.	0
ClaimBuster	6394	I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help.	1
ClaimBuster	6395	I can't go into detail about them here.	0
ClaimBuster	6396	And I'd have taken it out to the country and I'd have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen.	1
ClaimBuster	6397	Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.	1
ClaimBuster	6398	In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.	1
ClaimBuster	6399	Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do.	1
ClaimBuster	6400	Under Vice President Gore's plan, he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965.	1
ClaimBuster	6401	If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life.	0
ClaimBuster	6402	I know how to make that happen.	0
ClaimBuster	6403	They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare.	1
ClaimBuster	6404	There is no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	6405	I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation.	0
ClaimBuster	6406	This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	6407	We've been very successful in both cases.	0
ClaimBuster	6408	"[Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I don't know which, that said, ""If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.''"	1
ClaimBuster	6409	Send us some people that will pass the idea.	0
ClaimBuster	6410	Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the uh - problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	6411	They live all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	6412	We spent $3.1 billion for fire and police, $3.1 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	6413	It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6414	And it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running.	1
ClaimBuster	6415	The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work.	0
ClaimBuster	6416	And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career.	1
ClaimBuster	6417	He'll claim credit now for crime going down, but it happens because mayors and governors and others have brought crime down.	1
ClaimBuster	6418	But like Nancy Reagan, and so many other people -- you know, I was at a forum with Michael J.	1
ClaimBuster	6419	There is more work to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	6420	There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.	1
ClaimBuster	6421	I still have a couple of minutes left.	1
ClaimBuster	6422	It seemed to me that most of the arguments were partisan, Republican, Democrat, left, right, liberal, conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	6423	If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	6424	Well, they've got a point.	0
ClaimBuster	6425	But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense.	0
ClaimBuster	6426	But it has taken place.	1
ClaimBuster	6427	He's been in some other country.	1
ClaimBuster	6428	And I don't think most Americans could do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6429	But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist, ten years from now, you'd have to be certain you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the government was going to take over for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	6430	First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted.	1
ClaimBuster	6431	What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	6432	I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.	0
ClaimBuster	6433	Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	6434	First of all, we all know that in his state of the union message, he told Congress about nuclear materials that didn't exist.	1
ClaimBuster	6435	Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.	1
ClaimBuster	6436	We've been discouraged too long.	0
ClaimBuster	6437	But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	6438	Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.	0
ClaimBuster	6439	I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.	0
ClaimBuster	6440	You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.	1
ClaimBuster	6441	What are we going to tell our children?	0
ClaimBuster	6442	Our position happened to be at the airport.	1
ClaimBuster	6443	You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years.	0
ClaimBuster	6444	I don't believe, like the vice president does, in huge government.	0
ClaimBuster	6445	I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	6446	That's why I'm for instant background checks at gun shows, I'm for trigger locks, I think that makes sense.	0
ClaimBuster	6447	It's our vision of America.	0
ClaimBuster	6448	I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other's campaigns.	0
ClaimBuster	6449	I don't want to jump in.	0
ClaimBuster	6450	I keep my word, and you will have a tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	6451	I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead.	0
ClaimBuster	6452	Ladies and gentlemen, it's his tax plan.	0
ClaimBuster	6453	But what he has said is that, even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection with Al Qaida, he would still have done everything the same way.	1
ClaimBuster	6454	The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader.	1
ClaimBuster	6455	And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America.	0
ClaimBuster	6456	Uh Mr. Kraft, uh - I think the record can be put in this uh - in this way, which uh - is the way that I think satisfies most Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	6457	I'd like to just talk about issues, and so --	0
ClaimBuster	6458	We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job.	1
ClaimBuster	6459	And our cancer rate is uh - higher than any country in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	6460	And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.	0
ClaimBuster	6461	Well, tonight we've had a chance to talk a lot about the past.	1
ClaimBuster	6462	And I oppose it, and I'm going to stand up and continue to oppose it.	0
ClaimBuster	6463	If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6464	That's what Admiral Mullen said.	1
ClaimBuster	6465	It - my view is the same as his.	0
ClaimBuster	6466	It's the right thing for the consumers.	0
ClaimBuster	6467	We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	6468	The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession - and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars - or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh - during part of the Korean War.	1
ClaimBuster	6469	I gotta get it in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	6470	It would have been increase in sectarian violence.	0
ClaimBuster	6471	I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects.	0
ClaimBuster	6472	Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...	0
ClaimBuster	6473	Wherever possible the -- the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that's not always possible.	0
ClaimBuster	6474	They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	6475	And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	6476	We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	6477	In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education.	1
ClaimBuster	6478	Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.	0
ClaimBuster	6479	And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	6480	From the standpoint of MR, KENNEDY: Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas.	0
ClaimBuster	6481	If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	6482	I've worked with those leaders the president talks about, I've worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this president.	1
ClaimBuster	6483	In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.	0
ClaimBuster	6484	The other stuff -- all the other stuff I mentioned -- costs much less than that.	1
ClaimBuster	6485	And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	6486	Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	6487	And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce.	1
ClaimBuster	6488	They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	6489	But not just jobs, good paying jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	6490	This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya.	1
ClaimBuster	6491	And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?	0
ClaimBuster	6492	As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth.	0
ClaimBuster	6493	They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war.	1
ClaimBuster	6494	You get shot walking to the store.	1
ClaimBuster	6495	That's not the position you took, however.	0
ClaimBuster	6496	They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they've got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida.	1
ClaimBuster	6497	Because what I have proposed...	0
ClaimBuster	6498	Our competitors don't do that.	1
ClaimBuster	6499	There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops.	0
ClaimBuster	6500	So let me just give you one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	6501	Someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country to set a standard for our people to follow, to inspire our people to reach for greatness, to correct our defects, to answer difficult questions, to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity.	0
ClaimBuster	6502	They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	6503	We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	6504	But it's one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	6505	We're talking about 2 weeks from now you've gotta decide who's gonna be president.	1
ClaimBuster	6506	And I think it's going down.	0
ClaimBuster	6507	The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?	0
ClaimBuster	6508	And I want to come back to something I said before.	0
ClaimBuster	6509	Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.	0
ClaimBuster	6510	I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.	1
ClaimBuster	6511	Somewhere out there there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess.	0
ClaimBuster	6512	The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the president's plan, there would be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because today's workers pay in to the system for today's retirees.	1
ClaimBuster	6513	But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.	1
ClaimBuster	6514	"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina."	1
ClaimBuster	6515	You know, remember the question, are you better off?	0
ClaimBuster	6516	They also kick me around.	0
ClaimBuster	6517	But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally.	0
ClaimBuster	6518	And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on.	0
ClaimBuster	6519	So we've got to do something for them.	0
ClaimBuster	6520	But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.	1
ClaimBuster	6521	They were pressing it very hard.	1
ClaimBuster	6522	And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.	1
ClaimBuster	6523	Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there's a Social Security system around tomorrow.	1
ClaimBuster	6524	So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.	1
ClaimBuster	6525	Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.	1
ClaimBuster	6526	Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road.	0
ClaimBuster	6527	But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest.	1
ClaimBuster	6528	You've got a mature workforce.	0
ClaimBuster	6529	"Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of ""here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't."""	0
ClaimBuster	6530	The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas.	0
ClaimBuster	6531	And the key to great schools, great teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	6532	Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let's look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	6533	We need to expand education savings accounts.	0
ClaimBuster	6534	The tensions will be ratcheted up.	0
ClaimBuster	6535	People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is.	1
ClaimBuster	6536	Why didn't you do it?	0
ClaimBuster	6537	When you come out in 2014, I presume I'm going to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	6538	I don't think it's a question of eliminating.	0
ClaimBuster	6539	Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks.	1
ClaimBuster	6540	I said, if we do the things that I've set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months.	0
ClaimBuster	6541	And we are the US, and we have a responsibility to lead and to guarantee the security.	0
ClaimBuster	6542	There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated.	0
ClaimBuster	6543	And what I think needs to happen in order to encourage the young to become involved is to shoot straight, is to set aside the partisan differences, and set an agenda that will make sense.	0
ClaimBuster	6544	As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.	0
ClaimBuster	6545	I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.	0
ClaimBuster	6546	I don't know why -- I've never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset it, because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had foreign accounts.	1
ClaimBuster	6547	After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement - and I'm proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	6548	My targeted tax cut is for child-rearing, buying a first-time home, paying for health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	6549	I think the government can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	6550	I have seen us ignore Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	6551	Well, Mr. Ford acts like he's uh - running for president for the first time.	0
ClaimBuster	6552	And I have been a consistent reformer.	1
ClaimBuster	6553	You know, one of the responsibilities of growing older, it seems to me, is being able to tell people something they may not want to hear just because it's true.	0
ClaimBuster	6554	It wasn't created that is it was created as a whole retirement or supplement to retirement program.	1
ClaimBuster	6555	Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.	1
ClaimBuster	6556	"Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country."	0
ClaimBuster	6557	George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.	1
ClaimBuster	6558	It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	6559	Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	6560	It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship.	0
ClaimBuster	6561	I saw it done with our -- our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill from Massachusetts.	1
ClaimBuster	6562	Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education.	1
ClaimBuster	6563	He's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.	1
ClaimBuster	6564	I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice, to the House of Representatives twice.	1
ClaimBuster	6565	It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	6566	A lot of these people in industries can be converted to the industries of tomorrow, and that's where the high-paying jobs are.	0
ClaimBuster	6567	They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools.	1
ClaimBuster	6568	It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	6569	But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way.	0
ClaimBuster	6570	I'm asking for your vote, and God bless.	0
ClaimBuster	6571	I also want a bridge to the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	6572	They do stand for something.	0
ClaimBuster	6573	And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.	0
ClaimBuster	6574	Now, I wonder if the -- it's been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	6575	I wouldn't single out just food.	0
ClaimBuster	6576	I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way.	0
ClaimBuster	6577	But maybe there ought to be more debates.	0
ClaimBuster	6578	"That's the kind of mindset that said, ""Let's keep it at the United Nations and hope things go well."""	0
ClaimBuster	6579	Well, that is not what happens in these cases.	0
ClaimBuster	6580	We need this kind of strength because we're the guardians of the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	6581	I'm so glad that I have the chance to knock that down.	0
ClaimBuster	6582	Bring them back into the mainstream of public life.	0
ClaimBuster	6583	They're on the front lines.	0
ClaimBuster	6584	We've tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we've excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	6585	But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.	0
ClaimBuster	6586	But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the US Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	6587	We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are.	0
ClaimBuster	6588	A commitment to continuing step-by-step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while.	0
ClaimBuster	6589	And they brought him down.	1
ClaimBuster	6590	Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years?	0
ClaimBuster	6591	What Michael says, don't put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade.	0
ClaimBuster	6592	And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	6593	We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.	0
ClaimBuster	6594	We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	6595	No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.	1
ClaimBuster	6596	All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go.	0
ClaimBuster	6597	This is the worst trade year in American history by far.	1
ClaimBuster	6598	"Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, ""American boys into Indochina."""	1
ClaimBuster	6599	And, you know, in 2006 seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	6600	What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	6601	The question is our future.	0
ClaimBuster	6602	We've also stood up to the new threats of terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	6603	We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	6604	Everybody knows how to fix them.	0
ClaimBuster	6605	I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.	0
ClaimBuster	6606	In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.	1
ClaimBuster	6607	And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one.	1
ClaimBuster	6608	The agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House and the agreement -- the peace treaty with Jordan, I was -- I went to Jordan to sign that -- to be there.	1
ClaimBuster	6609	"His first statement was, ""Both sides ought to show restraint."""	1
ClaimBuster	6610	If you like that, you'll love Canada and England.	0
ClaimBuster	6611	You need a better community, you know, relation.	0
ClaimBuster	6612	Actually, Mr. Vice President, it's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	6613	Thank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us.	0
ClaimBuster	6614	You asked me a question.	1
ClaimBuster	6615	We have made available to the Israelis over 45 percent of the total economic and military aid since the establishment of Israel twenty-seven years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	6616	I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.	0
ClaimBuster	6617	I am very oriented toward the future.	0
ClaimBuster	6618	So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum.	0
ClaimBuster	6619	Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot.	0
ClaimBuster	6620	Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not.	0
ClaimBuster	6621	That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.	1
ClaimBuster	6622	We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.	0
ClaimBuster	6623	We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care.	0
ClaimBuster	6624	Took it three steps, twice we sent welfare reform to the president and he vetoed it.	1
ClaimBuster	6625	And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands.	0
ClaimBuster	6626	Yeah, but wouldn't that suggest to the American people, then, here's a quality person, if he decided that he could automatically get the nomination of either party?	0
ClaimBuster	6627	It should be a helping hand, and tax relief and the proposals I just described should be a good helping hand.	1
ClaimBuster	6628	It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.	0
ClaimBuster	6629	You can't have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law.	1
ClaimBuster	6630	To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs.	0
ClaimBuster	6631	Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.	0
ClaimBuster	6632	This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated.	1
ClaimBuster	6633	Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.	0
ClaimBuster	6634	The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard.	1
ClaimBuster	6635	And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.	0
ClaimBuster	6636	So I'm not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	6637	I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.	0
ClaimBuster	6638	I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.	0
ClaimBuster	6639	Three times since World War II, the Vice President has had to suddenly become the President and commander in chief.	1
ClaimBuster	6640	And I'd like to thank those of you who are watching.	0
ClaimBuster	6641	I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s and 40√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s.	0
ClaimBuster	6642	Uh - another system is where uhh - a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh - can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars - nine hundred mi- thousand dollars - that makes a million - and mark off a great amount of uh - of loss uh - through that procedure.	1
ClaimBuster	6643	Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...	0
ClaimBuster	6644	In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.	0
ClaimBuster	6645	But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are.	0
ClaimBuster	6646	Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes.	0
ClaimBuster	6647	And yet think about where we are: Added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months.	1
ClaimBuster	6648	And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.	0
ClaimBuster	6649	I'm just not going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6650	What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?	0
ClaimBuster	6651	In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.	1
ClaimBuster	6652	On the other things that you've just said about the terrorists, I'm tempted to ask you what you would do.	0
ClaimBuster	6653	Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	6654	And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you.	0
ClaimBuster	6655	I'd like to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	6656	Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn't be spent in any other nation.	1
ClaimBuster	6657	Term limits for members of the US Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	6658	In 1974, we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War.	1
ClaimBuster	6659	It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.	1
ClaimBuster	6660	It's going to help everything.	0
ClaimBuster	6661	Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country.	0
ClaimBuster	6662	They've had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you.	0
ClaimBuster	6663	Make an effort to put a ramp up there so someone in a wheelchair can get up.	0
ClaimBuster	6664	But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education.	1
ClaimBuster	6665	And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests.	0
ClaimBuster	6666	The president inherited growth of over 5 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	6667	That's not what happens in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	6668	I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.	0
ClaimBuster	6669	We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way.	1
ClaimBuster	6670	Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.	1
ClaimBuster	6671	"My opponent says help is on the way, but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harm's way, ""wrong war, wrong place, wrong time""?"	1
ClaimBuster	6672	Number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology.	0
ClaimBuster	6673	So I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly.	0
ClaimBuster	6674	If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation.	1
ClaimBuster	6675	But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from a position of strength.	1
ClaimBuster	6676	I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	6677	I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help.	1
ClaimBuster	6678	But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	6679	But it was a surprise to us, because they outnumbered us 64 to 36 in submarines and 20 percent more bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles than we had.	1
ClaimBuster	6680	And today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense - just working people who believe in me - spread around the country uh - involved in the political campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	6681	With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.	1
ClaimBuster	6682	You're judged by the whole record.	0
ClaimBuster	6683	On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented.	1
ClaimBuster	6684	A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country.	1
ClaimBuster	6685	I think what he should have done is gone before the American people on the front end and said listen, I made a commitment and it was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	6686	And the result is that you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other.	1
ClaimBuster	6687	Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	6688	By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.	1
ClaimBuster	6689	Well, the uh - the assumption that - that you uh - have described as different is in the rate of growth of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	6690	He's the first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	6691	Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6692	"So we had a policy called ""Mend it, don't end it."	1
ClaimBuster	6693	And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	6694	And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6695	The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.	1
ClaimBuster	6696	And I don't agree with them.	0
ClaimBuster	6697	We have got to become more concerned about people who play by the rules and get the balance we require.	0
ClaimBuster	6698	Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.	0
ClaimBuster	6699	It's going to be a hard fight.	0
ClaimBuster	6700	Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself.	1
ClaimBuster	6701	We need to think differently about the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	6702	As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	6703	Yet at the same time, he was very -- we were very unpopular in Europe because of the decisions he made.	1
ClaimBuster	6704	I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took.	0
ClaimBuster	6705	Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, ma'am.	0
ClaimBuster	6706	As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America.	0
ClaimBuster	6707	Government -- he says invest government, grow government.	1
ClaimBuster	6708	We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	6709	I mean, this guy, this is too much.	0
ClaimBuster	6710	If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy.	0
ClaimBuster	6711	After he left the senate, we abandoned that.	1
ClaimBuster	6712	We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	6713	Oh, I just thought about one.	0
ClaimBuster	6714	At his pace, it's going to take 13 years to reduce and get ahold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	6715	And simple things weren't done.	0
ClaimBuster	6716	If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system.	0
ClaimBuster	6717	We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	6718	The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.	0
ClaimBuster	6719	And let me tell you, you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	6720	That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	6721	As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.	1
ClaimBuster	6722	I don't think he misled you when he said that, you know, anyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didn't have the judgment to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	6723	They've got so many loopholes they don't have to pay much in taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	6724	I agree with the governor.	0
ClaimBuster	6725	You take a look at Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	6726	They left -- fired 1,400 people.	1
ClaimBuster	6727	It's one America, one nation.	0
ClaimBuster	6728	And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.	0
ClaimBuster	6729	If the uh - list was, uh - in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it.	0
ClaimBuster	6730	There's a pattern here of appealing to the auto workers and then trying to appeal to the spotted owl crowds or the extremes in the environmental movement.	0
ClaimBuster	6731	Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?	0
ClaimBuster	6732	Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	6733	It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.	1
ClaimBuster	6734	Now, the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	6735	Now let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.	0
ClaimBuster	6736	I will make them famous.	0
ClaimBuster	6737	So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.	0
ClaimBuster	6738	I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.	0
ClaimBuster	6739	I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	6740	I don't want to try to put our troops in all places at all times.	0
ClaimBuster	6741	In some cases, we are going to have to invest.	0
ClaimBuster	6742	I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.	0
ClaimBuster	6743	So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.	1
ClaimBuster	6744	It's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.	0
ClaimBuster	6745	And we need to win that future.	0
ClaimBuster	6746	"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, ""Now, are you willing to join us?"	0
ClaimBuster	6747	And we support the U.N. efforts there.	1
ClaimBuster	6748	You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it.	1
ClaimBuster	6749	Those words really have to mean something.	0
ClaimBuster	6750	I want to correct, the all these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn't have had and we probably voted no.	1
ClaimBuster	6751	That's why I support instant background checks at gun shows.	1
ClaimBuster	6752	And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.	1
ClaimBuster	6753	And that's why it is essential we not leave.	0
ClaimBuster	6754	And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	6755	Let's get him working on Syria, their client state, and see if we can't get them to join Israel and other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region.	0
ClaimBuster	6756	Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	6757	We don't have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems.	1
ClaimBuster	6758	The big drug companies support Governor Bush's prescription drug proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	6759	And the world is better off without him in power.	0
ClaimBuster	6760	Well, but he gets the first word of that segment.	0
ClaimBuster	6761	We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society.	1
ClaimBuster	6762	It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds.	1
ClaimBuster	6763	Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.	0
ClaimBuster	6764	Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.	1
ClaimBuster	6765	New York -- New York has done an excellent job.	0
ClaimBuster	6766	There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...	0
ClaimBuster	6767	Lock your wallet because he's coming right after you just like Jimmy Carter did and just like you're going to get -- you're going to end up with interest rates at 21%, and you're going to have inflation going through the roof.	1
ClaimBuster	6768	But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.	0
ClaimBuster	6769	That ammo is now being used against our kids.	0
ClaimBuster	6770	Well yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous Administrations in the preceding eight years to this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	6771	If you've been on television about it, you think you did it.	0
ClaimBuster	6772	And that's what I've done administratively.	0
ClaimBuster	6773	The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City.	1
ClaimBuster	6774	say, he is our hero.	0
ClaimBuster	6775	Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh - is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record.	0
ClaimBuster	6776	people get so tired of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	6777	It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.	0
ClaimBuster	6778	It's the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	6779	And I would hope to never have to use force.	0
ClaimBuster	6780	They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations.	0
ClaimBuster	6781	He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.	1
ClaimBuster	6782	We shouldn't be dwelling on the past, or even the present.	0
ClaimBuster	6783	It says if you√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body.	1
ClaimBuster	6784	I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus.	1
ClaimBuster	6785	There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.	1
ClaimBuster	6786	We'll stay on the hunt on Al Qaida.	0
ClaimBuster	6787	Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.	1
ClaimBuster	6788	We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco.	0
ClaimBuster	6789	If you don't get a two-thirds, then your resolution doesn't pass.	1
ClaimBuster	6790	I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.	0
ClaimBuster	6791	My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace.	0
ClaimBuster	6792	That made no sense whatsoever.	0
ClaimBuster	6793	We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	6794	Take a look at Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	6795	It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me -- she's got 42 kids in her class.	1
ClaimBuster	6796	Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government.	1
ClaimBuster	6797	Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag.	0
ClaimBuster	6798	But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage - with the tax incentive - the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	6799	I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful.	0
ClaimBuster	6800	This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable.	0
ClaimBuster	6801	I'm going to have a special prosecutor.	0
ClaimBuster	6802	And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill.	0
ClaimBuster	6803	I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say - say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice.	0
ClaimBuster	6804	If they can't make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off.	0
ClaimBuster	6805	You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	6806	We've raised about $10 million.	1
ClaimBuster	6807	Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back.	0
ClaimBuster	6808	You may not be one of them, you're just not one of the right people.	0
ClaimBuster	6809	I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.	0
ClaimBuster	6810	But you're investing in companies doesn't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6811	The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.	0
ClaimBuster	6812	As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	6813	I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.	0
ClaimBuster	6814	I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil.	0
ClaimBuster	6815	I have brought into the top level, top levels of government, into the White House, into administrative offices of the Executive branch, into the judicial system, highly qualified black and Spanish citizens and women who in the past had been excluded.	1
ClaimBuster	6816	I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues, from the armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues and the nuclear issues on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	6817	But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	6818	The uh - description just made of this administration's record is hard to uh - recognize.	0
ClaimBuster	6819	What I would not have had done was left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down.	1
ClaimBuster	6820	Let's talk about corporate taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	6821	We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care.	0
ClaimBuster	6822	You're going to get a repeat of the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	6823	On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.	0
ClaimBuster	6824	I mean, what do you need, a signed document?	0
ClaimBuster	6825	The president's terms are limited to 2, a total of 8 years.	1
ClaimBuster	6826	He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.	0
ClaimBuster	6827	And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6828	They have no idea where they come from.	1
ClaimBuster	6829	Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible.	0
ClaimBuster	6830	When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.	1
ClaimBuster	6831	One is to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	6832	You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	6833	I think the record shows otherwise.	0
ClaimBuster	6834	Governor, we have actually produced more oil --	1
ClaimBuster	6835	The administration says they support the instant check.	1
ClaimBuster	6836	And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	6837	I think that's the essence of leadership, rather than cutting deals in dark rooms in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	6838	But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6839	And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time.	0
ClaimBuster	6840	We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be -- excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation.	1
ClaimBuster	6841	This, I believe, has assured that our interests will be protected in the Persian Gulf region, as we have done in the Middle East and throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6842	And when we talk about deficits, if we're adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don't need them, and we're cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race.	0
ClaimBuster	6843	Everybody got tax relief, so that they get out of the recession.	1
ClaimBuster	6844	Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Government's invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child.	0
ClaimBuster	6845	I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people.	0
ClaimBuster	6846	I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.	0
ClaimBuster	6847	She gets a small pension, but in order to pay for her prescription drug benefits, she has to go out seven days a week several hours a day picking up cans.	1
ClaimBuster	6848	"You know, I saw a movie - ""Crocodile Dundee."""	1
ClaimBuster	6849	And we are bleeding arterially.	0
ClaimBuster	6850	It's what are our capabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	6851	And I never made that statement; never would.	1
ClaimBuster	6852	Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator Quayle, that if you give any of us $200 billion worth of hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity.	1
ClaimBuster	6853	Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...	0
ClaimBuster	6854	And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.	1
ClaimBuster	6855	I can't take anything off the table.	0
ClaimBuster	6856	I use that term with all respect, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	6857	The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.	0
ClaimBuster	6858	Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way.	0
ClaimBuster	6859	Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.	0
ClaimBuster	6860	It's not going to be all done by legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	6861	But I can counsel people.	1
ClaimBuster	6862	You ain't seen nothing yet.	0
ClaimBuster	6863	All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.	0
ClaimBuster	6864	Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about somebody else.	0
ClaimBuster	6865	I believe that Governor Carter doesn't realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	6866	First of all, I don't think he can succeed in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	6867	And we have a duty to our country and to future generations of America to achieve a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, and to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	6868	Look, I love to -- I love teachers, and I'm happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that.	0
ClaimBuster	6869	So all of these things need to be examined, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	6870	Let's see how they do.	0
ClaimBuster	6871	He more than doubled state spending while he was Governor - 122% increase - and had between a 20% and 30% increase in the number of employees	1
ClaimBuster	6872	We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.	0
ClaimBuster	6873	I think that we're showing the proper compassion and concern.	0
ClaimBuster	6874	But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.	0
ClaimBuster	6875	But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before.	0
ClaimBuster	6876	I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	6877	Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	6878	But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	6879	Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.	0
ClaimBuster	6880	But it takes more than that.	0
ClaimBuster	6881	I don't want to rip families apart.	0
ClaimBuster	6882	You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital.	0
ClaimBuster	6883	You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.	0
ClaimBuster	6884	But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	6885	Where we're not making the progress, Sander, is in -- we're making it in teenagers, and thank God, because I thought what Ross said was most appropriate about these families and these children.	0
ClaimBuster	6886	And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.	1
ClaimBuster	6887	And I think, my gosh, wouldn't it be wonderful if every child had that love and support.	0
ClaimBuster	6888	The vice president keeps saying I'm against things.	1
ClaimBuster	6889	We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it's clean burning.	0
ClaimBuster	6890	I have clear eyes on this.	0
ClaimBuster	6891	They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	6892	She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?	1
ClaimBuster	6893	The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.	0
ClaimBuster	6894	That's what a leader does.	0
ClaimBuster	6895	And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	6896	It's very unlike World War II, when FDR's sons flew missions.	1
ClaimBuster	6897	Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care.	1
ClaimBuster	6898	We're the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties we're having.	0
ClaimBuster	6899	... with the Russians and other foreign powers.	0
ClaimBuster	6900	Not to the schools but to -- you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school.	1
ClaimBuster	6901	Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.	1
ClaimBuster	6902	NATO, for example, has kept the peace for many, many years, and I want to see us keep fully staffed in NATO so we'll continue to guarantee the peace in Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	6903	But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.	0
ClaimBuster	6904	And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.	0
ClaimBuster	6905	And I'm, you know -- there would be special rights for different groups in America.	0
ClaimBuster	6906	And if we're strong in each of those things, American influence will grow.	0
ClaimBuster	6907	I didn't say we had the worst education in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	6908	What was he referring to?	0
ClaimBuster	6909	Fewer water complaints since I've been the president.	1
ClaimBuster	6910	We're the reform party, and we're going to make things better, and one of the things we're going to do is stop exporting jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	6911	This was an attack by terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	6912	We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	6913	I don't think the surplus is the government's money.	0
ClaimBuster	6914	Mr. President, the voluntary thing that I suggested many years ago was that with a young man orphaned and raised by an aunt who died, his aunt was ineligible for Social Security insurance because she was not his mother.	1
ClaimBuster	6915	But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.	0
ClaimBuster	6916	We'll spend $25 trillion -- we'll collect $25 trillion in revenue in the next 10 years and spend $21 trillion.	0
ClaimBuster	6917	They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	6918	Do they want to follow United States leadership?	0
ClaimBuster	6919	And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	6920	On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.	1
ClaimBuster	6921	My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	1
ClaimBuster	6922	We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	6923	And that -- don't take my word for it, take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney.	1
ClaimBuster	6924	He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	6925	Ours is a big state, a fast-growing state.	1
ClaimBuster	6926	Then you didn't read it.	0
ClaimBuster	6927	There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up.	1
ClaimBuster	6928	No, because I'm pledged to that, and yes, some taxes have gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	6929	Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement.	0
ClaimBuster	6930	And, absolutely, we need earmark reform.	0
ClaimBuster	6931	"Maybe an 18th resolution would work,"" he would have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off."	0
ClaimBuster	6932	These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	6933	But the key that we're going to have to pursue is a -- is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own.	0
ClaimBuster	6934	I was against the war.	1
ClaimBuster	6935	In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models.	0
ClaimBuster	6936	And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.	0
ClaimBuster	6937	There is no litmus test on any issue.	0
ClaimBuster	6938	And yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe.	1
ClaimBuster	6939	The American people are bright, intelligent, caring, loving people who want a great country for their children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	6940	I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.	0
ClaimBuster	6941	And that's what I want to talk about.	0
ClaimBuster	6942	But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	6943	But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.	0
ClaimBuster	6944	It's kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $30-billion tab to defend your country.	0
ClaimBuster	6945	And we've watched this president actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table.	1
ClaimBuster	6946	That is why Senator wh- President Eisenhower was also correct in his policy in the Formosa Straits, where he declined, and refused to follow the recommendations - recommendations which Senator Kennedy voted for in 1955; again made in 1959; again repeated in his debates that you have heard - recommendations with regard to - again - slicing off a piece of free territory, and abandoning it, if - in effect, to the Communists.	1
ClaimBuster	6947	-- and we don't need more of them in the Senate or more of them in the House.	0
ClaimBuster	6948	Could I just respond to this, please?	0
ClaimBuster	6949	Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.	1
ClaimBuster	6950	I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them.	1
ClaimBuster	6951	And we find bad teachers another line of work.	0
ClaimBuster	6952	I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect.	1
ClaimBuster	6953	And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal.	0
ClaimBuster	6954	I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders.	1
ClaimBuster	6955	Now, for the people earning more than $200,000 a year, you're going to see a rollback to the level we were at with Bill Clinton, when people made a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	6956	They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.	1
ClaimBuster	6957	We don't want to go back to that.	0
ClaimBuster	6958	Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.	1
ClaimBuster	6959	Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	6960	I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced.	0
ClaimBuster	6961	First of all, let me say that I've spent more of my time and life on this in the last 12 years than any other issue.	1
ClaimBuster	6962	I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	6963	And I promise you that that will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	6964	What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology.	0
ClaimBuster	6965	I'm for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don't have good trade agreements across the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6966	But we are protecting both of them.	0
ClaimBuster	6967	I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids.	0
ClaimBuster	6968	And the reason is crack babies being born, babies in the hospital 42 days.	1
ClaimBuster	6969	They are the best workers in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6970	So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	6971	But keep in mind we are spending 30% more on health care than any country in the world, any country, and yet we have 35 million people uninsured, we have no preventing and primary care.	1
ClaimBuster	6972	I've talked with a number of them.	1
ClaimBuster	6973	In Africa - these countries that have newly joined the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	6974	I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.	0
ClaimBuster	6975	But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders.	1
ClaimBuster	6976	You see it in the church burnings.	0
ClaimBuster	6977	I'm going to do it in four years.	0
ClaimBuster	6978	Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.	1
ClaimBuster	6979	And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.	1
ClaimBuster	6980	With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all.	0
ClaimBuster	6981	If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	6982	Well, in fact we saved 1,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	6983	And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	6984	When we do that, instead of shutting the government down over a partisan fight over the budget, we're a better country and that's why we're making progress now.	0
ClaimBuster	6985	I presume the Vice President supported it when the President signed that bill and supports it now.	0
ClaimBuster	6986	Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	6987	Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed.	0
ClaimBuster	6988	It called for uh - conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	6989	I want to keep taxes low.	0
ClaimBuster	6990	I look around the world and I don't feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar any more.	1
ClaimBuster	6991	I'm going to stand by Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	6992	It will be a world of peace because we're going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends.	0
ClaimBuster	6993	I commend you for supporting that.	0
ClaimBuster	6994	There's an interesting issue up in the northwest as well.	0
ClaimBuster	6995	Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny.	0
ClaimBuster	6996	They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.	0
ClaimBuster	6997	And what are his health programs?	0
ClaimBuster	6998	The American people are beginning to vote across racial lines, and I hope it will happen more and more.	1
ClaimBuster	6999	You did -- suffered through that?	0
ClaimBuster	7000	All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.	0
ClaimBuster	7001	I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.	0
ClaimBuster	7002	I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.	0
ClaimBuster	7003	I think first of all, let me -- let me repeat -- let me repeat what I said.	0
ClaimBuster	7004	It's important, it's their future.	0
ClaimBuster	7005	Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	7006	We need to reform these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	7007	We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir government in the Sudan.	1
ClaimBuster	7008	It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years.	1
ClaimBuster	7009	I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.	0
ClaimBuster	7010	The government doesn't require you to do anything.	1
ClaimBuster	7011	At the same time, we put a limitation of thirteen hundred and twenty on MIRVs.	1
ClaimBuster	7012	And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing.	1
ClaimBuster	7013	And it won't help us grow.	0
ClaimBuster	7014	And my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America.	0
ClaimBuster	7015	And I think a woman's right to choose ought to be protected and defended.	0
ClaimBuster	7016	We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	7017	Whether it's Syria, you name it.	0
ClaimBuster	7018	I think he's a good person.	0
ClaimBuster	7019	I'll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers.	0
ClaimBuster	7020	I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	7021	Part of American leadership is making sure that we're doing nation building here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	7022	Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	7023	Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	7024	But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.	1
ClaimBuster	7025	And if we find success we'll praise it.	0
ClaimBuster	7026	You cannot lead the world if you do not honor the contributions of those who are with us.	0
ClaimBuster	7027	And then it gets down to a question of values.	0
ClaimBuster	7028	And I suggested that if this is an insurance program, certainly the person who is paying in should be able to name his own beneficiary.	1
ClaimBuster	7029	In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	7030	Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans.	1
ClaimBuster	7031	And I'm very proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	7032	In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.	1
ClaimBuster	7033	So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net.	0
ClaimBuster	7034	That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make.	0
ClaimBuster	7035	And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children.	0
ClaimBuster	7036	So we're now going to take Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	7037	Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives.	0
ClaimBuster	7038	Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?	0
ClaimBuster	7039	If I can answer the question.	0
ClaimBuster	7040	You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.	0
ClaimBuster	7041	And these grain sales to the Soviet Union have helped us tremendously in meeting the costs of the additional oil and - the oil that we have bought from overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	7042	You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.	1
ClaimBuster	7043	It would've been inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo.	0
ClaimBuster	7044	And I've put ours together in something called the Agenda for American Renewal, and it makes sense, it's sensible, it creates jobs, it gets to the base of the kind of jobs we need.	0
ClaimBuster	7045	And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.	0
ClaimBuster	7046	Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.	0
ClaimBuster	7047	If you're paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working.	1
ClaimBuster	7048	Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	7049	And I'm against price controls.	1
ClaimBuster	7050	The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?	0
ClaimBuster	7051	Under this administration we've also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts.	0
ClaimBuster	7052	I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons.	0
ClaimBuster	7053	It's not like you want to close the loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	7054	I get audited by the IRS.	1
ClaimBuster	7055	We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.	1
ClaimBuster	7056	People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy.	0
ClaimBuster	7057	He said it was a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	7058	So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.	0
ClaimBuster	7059	We've got to have a different energy plan.	0
ClaimBuster	7060	And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.	0
ClaimBuster	7061	Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win.	0
ClaimBuster	7062	600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldn't sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up.	1
ClaimBuster	7063	We'll be resolute, we'll be strong, and we'll wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	7064	But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can - with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction.	0
ClaimBuster	7065	"He went on to say, ""Look at her."	1
ClaimBuster	7066	When Governor Reagan has been asked about that, he makes the very disturbing comment that non-proliferation, or the control of the spread of nuclear weapons, is none of our business.	1
ClaimBuster	7067	But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.	0
ClaimBuster	7068	I do support the other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen other ways of dealing with undocumented workers in this difficult area and dealing with the problem of settling people who have lived here for many, many years and do not have an established status.	0
ClaimBuster	7069	I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto.	0
ClaimBuster	7070	Uh - Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	7071	And I'm sure you'll try to do it again.	0
ClaimBuster	7072	We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	7073	The tax issue, because I think it's very important.	0
ClaimBuster	7074	I don't want to be sending parents away from children.	0
ClaimBuster	7075	Let us move now to the future.	0
ClaimBuster	7076	Take a look at the migration.	0
ClaimBuster	7077	I think of a teacher right here, largely Hispanic school, Jaime Escalante, teaching calculus to young kids, 80 percent of them going on to college.	1
ClaimBuster	7078	And the equal rights amendment only says that equality of rights shall not be abridged for omen b the Federal Government or by he state governments.	1
ClaimBuster	7079	John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important.	0
ClaimBuster	7080	Our energy policies are a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	7081	Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.	1
ClaimBuster	7082	We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office.	0
ClaimBuster	7083	I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in.	0
ClaimBuster	7084	With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me, without a job.	1
ClaimBuster	7085	Well, first, I love great schools.	0
ClaimBuster	7086	And we will come home with victory and with honor.	0
ClaimBuster	7087	We need to shift from oil to coal.	0
ClaimBuster	7088	So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.	1
ClaimBuster	7089	Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	7090	Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	7091	I want to keep this expansion going.	0
ClaimBuster	7092	So, it's conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess.	0
ClaimBuster	7093	We need a new approach.	0
ClaimBuster	7094	But look at that deal.	0
ClaimBuster	7095	And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	7096	And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.	0
ClaimBuster	7097	We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it.	0
ClaimBuster	7098	But I don't think these labels mean a thing and I would hope that tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign, we can have good solid disagreements on issues.	0
ClaimBuster	7099	And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support.	0
ClaimBuster	7100	If you make less than $30,000 a year and you put $500 in a savings account, the federal government will match it with $1500.	1
ClaimBuster	7101	And I'd like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we've probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department.	1
ClaimBuster	7102	They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.	1
ClaimBuster	7103	I could run this string out a long time, but remember this, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	7104	And the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains.	0
ClaimBuster	7105	I wonder if the Governor would lend his support to that law.	0
ClaimBuster	7106	I hope you don't think that.	0
ClaimBuster	7107	I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isn't the end of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7108	But it takes presidential leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	7109	And it is silly putty, folks, and the American people have had enough of it.	0
ClaimBuster	7110	This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.	1
ClaimBuster	7111	Federal government doesn't do that.	1
ClaimBuster	7112	Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.	1
ClaimBuster	7113	But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.	0
ClaimBuster	7114	We have more people who qualify.	1
ClaimBuster	7115	I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	7116	I strongly believe in local control of schools.	0
ClaimBuster	7117	But I won't take them lightly.	0
ClaimBuster	7118	They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.	1
ClaimBuster	7119	Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	7120	And that's the kind of judge that I want.	0
ClaimBuster	7121	It's their route to the sea.	1
ClaimBuster	7122	Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime.	1
ClaimBuster	7123	And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down.	0
ClaimBuster	7124	And we'll continue to do so over the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	7125	I do not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	7126	We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas.	1
ClaimBuster	7127	And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.	0
ClaimBuster	7128	My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	7129	You're not for school choice, you can't be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again.	0
ClaimBuster	7130	And you have to vote for somebody with a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	7131	And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7132	That's what governors ought to do.	0
ClaimBuster	7133	And that can only be done through governmental action.	0
ClaimBuster	7134	These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me.	0
ClaimBuster	7135	The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough.	0
ClaimBuster	7136	It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing.	0
ClaimBuster	7137	Yes, we should make a great effort.	0
ClaimBuster	7138	And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead.	1
ClaimBuster	7139	So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh - work with that Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	7140	But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?	0
ClaimBuster	7141	Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost.	0
ClaimBuster	7142	But it's -- the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good.	0
ClaimBuster	7143	"""So I said all right."	1
ClaimBuster	7144	I want to work for universal free school because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else.	1
ClaimBuster	7145	Let's talk about housing which the question was.	0
ClaimBuster	7146	And the president's been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say I'm wishy-washy, that I'm a flip-flopper.	0
ClaimBuster	7147	We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken.	0
ClaimBuster	7148	You treated him with terrible disrespect.	0
ClaimBuster	7149	So we're still in the fight.	0
ClaimBuster	7150	But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law.	0
ClaimBuster	7151	But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.	1
ClaimBuster	7152	You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill.	0
ClaimBuster	7153	Every American should be aware of the seriousness of the step.	0
ClaimBuster	7154	Colin Powell, our secretary of state, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog of working with the North Koreans.	1
ClaimBuster	7155	That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity.	0
ClaimBuster	7156	Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now?	1
ClaimBuster	7157	Now, I think that it's a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected.	0
ClaimBuster	7158	And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	7159	It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system.	0
ClaimBuster	7160	First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.	0
ClaimBuster	7161	We did the right thing.	0
ClaimBuster	7162	There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that haven't previously been available and so forth, so it was a mutually agreed- upon piece of legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	7163	But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation.	0
ClaimBuster	7164	And -- and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.	1
ClaimBuster	7165	I have fought against spending.	1
ClaimBuster	7166	Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.	0
ClaimBuster	7167	It's a sick art form.	0
ClaimBuster	7168	The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more.	1
ClaimBuster	7169	The president and I have always agreed on that.	1
ClaimBuster	7170	I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.	0
ClaimBuster	7171	I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state.	1
ClaimBuster	7172	Somebody hit me and said Barry Goldwater said you ought to talk on issues more.	1
ClaimBuster	7173	We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said.	1
ClaimBuster	7174	We've also got uh - a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	7175	And the president's right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land.	1
ClaimBuster	7176	But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	7177	I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7178	Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.	1
ClaimBuster	7179	To the extent humanly possible, we get that out.	0
ClaimBuster	7180	We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	7181	So I've been working on it when I was a governor for a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	7182	The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he's often talked as if we should take premature military action.	1
ClaimBuster	7183	The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together.	0
ClaimBuster	7184	We cannot move to the extreme.	0
ClaimBuster	7185	I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there.	0
ClaimBuster	7186	They're growing at 8 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	7187	So what we've got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line.	0
ClaimBuster	7188	Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review.	0
ClaimBuster	7189	And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and it's not a new position for me.	0
ClaimBuster	7190	I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others.	1
ClaimBuster	7191	And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.	0
ClaimBuster	7192	The president said by now we'd be a 5.4 percent unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	7193	I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	7194	I want to be the best president I can be for every American.	0
ClaimBuster	7195	So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?	0
ClaimBuster	7196	They're going to start hiring people.	0
ClaimBuster	7197	And actually -- well, that was very interesting.	0
ClaimBuster	7198	Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.	1
ClaimBuster	7199	You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.	1
ClaimBuster	7200	That's pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war.	0
ClaimBuster	7201	We're moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing.	0
ClaimBuster	7202	We still have trillion-dollar deficits.	1
ClaimBuster	7203	And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected.	0
ClaimBuster	7204	To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, I'm sorry, I think it sets back the cause.	0
ClaimBuster	7205	You're not going to go without food and you're not going to go without medical care.	0
ClaimBuster	7206	These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.	0
ClaimBuster	7207	A great big company can buy -- Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful.	1
ClaimBuster	7208	Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	7209	Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.	0
ClaimBuster	7210	That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case.	1
ClaimBuster	7211	And you need to know the record here.	0
ClaimBuster	7212	I'm thinking of Ross Perot's running mate sitting in the jail.	0
ClaimBuster	7213	Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise.	0
ClaimBuster	7214	Maybe I am, but I just don't think that's right.	0
ClaimBuster	7215	I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	7216	Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there.	0
ClaimBuster	7217	Former chief of the -- Joint Chiefs of Staff said that -- Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.	1
ClaimBuster	7218	But that's as far as I would go with it.	0
ClaimBuster	7219	What were her written instructions?	0
ClaimBuster	7220	In spite of the economic problems, we're the most respected economy around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7221	That, to me, is the key.	0
ClaimBuster	7222	But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	7223	I have a plan for that.	0
ClaimBuster	7224	That is not free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	7225	And I want seniors to have additional choices when it comes to choosing their health care plans.	0
ClaimBuster	7226	Whenever a weapon is tested we count the number of warheads on it, and whenever that warhead is used we count that number of warheads, whether they have that number or less on it, or not.	1
ClaimBuster	7227	And I think that's shocking; it's shameful.	0
ClaimBuster	7228	You need to test every year.	0
ClaimBuster	7229	Now, it's our turn to take that torch.	0
ClaimBuster	7230	That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.	0
ClaimBuster	7231	His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.	1
ClaimBuster	7232	I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.	0
ClaimBuster	7233	I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	7234	We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7235	I have cut defense spending.	1
ClaimBuster	7236	In my own state, we did it.	1
ClaimBuster	7237	But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	7238	And I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children's bedrooms.	1
ClaimBuster	7239	And I wonder if it's our fault, the candidates' fault.	0
ClaimBuster	7240	It doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day.	0
ClaimBuster	7241	Well, Jim, first of all, I would like to thank the sponsors of this debate and the people of Boston for hosting the debate.	0
ClaimBuster	7242	Ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive.	0
ClaimBuster	7243	I think it's important to promote a culture of life.	0
ClaimBuster	7244	In eight years they haven't gotten anything done on Medicare, on Social Security, a patient's bill of rights.	0
ClaimBuster	7245	We don't need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	7246	And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh - continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	7247	I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade.	1
ClaimBuster	7248	-- because if the American people send me there, we'll get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	7249	But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.	0
ClaimBuster	7250	I refer, for example, to distressed areas.	0
ClaimBuster	7251	It wasn't me that was there at that convention.	1
ClaimBuster	7252	The governor is the chief executive officer.	1
ClaimBuster	7253	Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.	0
ClaimBuster	7254	This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America.	0
ClaimBuster	7255	In this particular situation, no.	0
ClaimBuster	7256	You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close.	1
ClaimBuster	7257	Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this.	1
ClaimBuster	7258	So what I'm trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7259	This is a -- this is an important election and I'm concerned about America.	0
ClaimBuster	7260	There are some things that I think have to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	7261	You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	7262	But I can take it.	0
ClaimBuster	7263	You have a differential in wages right now.	1
ClaimBuster	7264	When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.	1
ClaimBuster	7265	He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	7266	But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America.	0
ClaimBuster	7267	I'm very glad to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	7268	And I'm convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	7269	Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	7270	It will not be a re-ignition of the Cold War, but Russia is a challenge.	0
ClaimBuster	7271	We found the people who could least afford it - people on retired incomes uh - people on fixed incomes - we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month.	1
ClaimBuster	7272	Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.	1
ClaimBuster	7273	And that's why it's going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	7274	You've had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you'll understand it.	1
ClaimBuster	7275	He wanted that said -- 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	7276	And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.	0
ClaimBuster	7277	And we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations.	0
ClaimBuster	7278	What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems.	0
ClaimBuster	7279	"We're also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, ""You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support that's necessary."""	1
ClaimBuster	7280	They just wouldn't do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price they're paying by waiting until it's obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems.	0
ClaimBuster	7281	And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	7282	Well among my other experiences in the past, I've - I've been a nuclear engineer, and did graduate work in this field.	1
ClaimBuster	7283	If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.	0
ClaimBuster	7284	We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it's nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose.	1
ClaimBuster	7285	I believe we need some fairness.	0
ClaimBuster	7286	I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done.	0
ClaimBuster	7287	Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	7288	They've never seen anything happen in that town.	0
ClaimBuster	7289	They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system.	0
ClaimBuster	7290	Let me s- look also at what I did.	0
ClaimBuster	7291	And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	7292	That is not a recipe for growth.	0
ClaimBuster	7293	Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	7294	I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential.	0
ClaimBuster	7295	I want workers to have their own assets.	0
ClaimBuster	7296	There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done.	0
ClaimBuster	7297	I ask you for your trust.	0
ClaimBuster	7298	Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle, and before he did it, he said, watch my choice for vice president, it will tell all And it sure did.	1
ClaimBuster	7299	You need somebody working for you and you've got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists.	0
ClaimBuster	7300	You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	7301	And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people.	0
ClaimBuster	7302	I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts.	0
ClaimBuster	7303	It's going to be a test of our strength.	0
ClaimBuster	7304	The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.	0
ClaimBuster	7305	You stay around this long enough, you think about -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it.	0
ClaimBuster	7306	The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50.	1
ClaimBuster	7307	It's a remarkable thing in a country like ours, a man who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for president.	0
ClaimBuster	7308	And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.	1
ClaimBuster	7309	"I knew we'd have somebody out there yelling ""read my lips"", and I did it because I thought it was right."	0
ClaimBuster	7310	The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally.	1
ClaimBuster	7311	Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.	0
ClaimBuster	7312	And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.	0
ClaimBuster	7313	No, I don't happen to share that goal.	0
ClaimBuster	7314	We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	7315	According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.	1
ClaimBuster	7316	Because people shouldn't be taxed twice on their assets.	0
ClaimBuster	7317	We're encouraging it and working with the industry.	1
ClaimBuster	7318	And that's a big, big factor.	0
ClaimBuster	7319	And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	7320	So what I don't know is what the unexpected will be.	0
ClaimBuster	7321	That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	7322	Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World.	0
ClaimBuster	7323	I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.	0
ClaimBuster	7324	The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.	1
ClaimBuster	7325	If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have.	0
ClaimBuster	7326	And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.	1
ClaimBuster	7327	And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them.	1
ClaimBuster	7328	"Faith without works is dead. """	0
ClaimBuster	7329	Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that's a tradition that has served us well.	1
ClaimBuster	7330	And the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here in terms of Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	7331	People care a lot about their land and care about their environment.	0
ClaimBuster	7332	And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	0
ClaimBuster	7333	Khan network has been brought to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	7334	I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	7335	Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.	0
ClaimBuster	7336	So, that was the only place that that was used.	1
ClaimBuster	7337	I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did.	1
ClaimBuster	7338	So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.	1
ClaimBuster	7339	Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it.	0
ClaimBuster	7340	Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it.	0
ClaimBuster	7341	And the difference between Arkansas and the US is that we're going in the right direction and this country's going in the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	7342	Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter.	1
ClaimBuster	7343	There is a considerable anti-Washington feeling throughout the country.	0
ClaimBuster	7344	Not because we coddled them, but because the Administration was pushed into doing something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	7345	When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%.	1
ClaimBuster	7346	Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?	0
ClaimBuster	7347	Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.	0
ClaimBuster	7348	We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	7349	And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.	1
ClaimBuster	7350	But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.	1
ClaimBuster	7351	But this president didn't try to fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	7352	What we got to do is keep working, as the Labor Dept is doing a first-class job on, to break down discrimination, to break down the glass ceiling.	1
ClaimBuster	7353	He was furious because he told me that it was the action of me, President Ford, that saved the lives of the crew of the Mayaguez.	1
ClaimBuster	7354	So did Governor Thompson, so did Governor Rowland.	1
ClaimBuster	7355	I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.	0
ClaimBuster	7356	Those stem- cells lines already existed.	1
ClaimBuster	7357	But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money.	0
ClaimBuster	7358	And you've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	7359	I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done.	0
ClaimBuster	7360	I supported him on NAFTA and GATT.	1
ClaimBuster	7361	The Vice President's plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade.	1
ClaimBuster	7362	And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.	0
ClaimBuster	7363	I could have gone on forever.	0
ClaimBuster	7364	Believe me, people with AIDS are more than willing to take that risk.	0
ClaimBuster	7365	And that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.	0
ClaimBuster	7366	I -- I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate.	0
ClaimBuster	7367	I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again.	0
ClaimBuster	7368	Certainly we can find a coffeepot that costs something less than $7,000.	1
ClaimBuster	7369	But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.	0
ClaimBuster	7370	We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh - Medicaid uh - laws, and the uh - food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh - they don't have to pay any taxes on it.	1
ClaimBuster	7371	Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street.	1
ClaimBuster	7372	And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.	0
ClaimBuster	7373	And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	7374	We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.	0
ClaimBuster	7375	I do hope you will read our plans.	0
ClaimBuster	7376	And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.	0
ClaimBuster	7377	And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.	1
ClaimBuster	7378	One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.	1
ClaimBuster	7379	I do not believe in cutting our military.	0
ClaimBuster	7380	And, unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.	0
ClaimBuster	7381	But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values.	0
ClaimBuster	7382	By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America?	0
ClaimBuster	7383	We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.	0
ClaimBuster	7384	I - I have to say that my campaign has been an open one.	0
ClaimBuster	7385	When a drug comes in from Canada, I want to make sure it cures you and doesn't kill you.	0
ClaimBuster	7386	But it's not a statement about his heart.	0
ClaimBuster	7387	But it was a calculated risk that paid off.	0
ClaimBuster	7388	But I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules, because that's how our economy's grown.	0
ClaimBuster	7389	He refers to one tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	7390	Well, the president and his experts have told America that it's not a question of if; it's a question of when.	1
ClaimBuster	7391	We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.	0
ClaimBuster	7392	And I've never discussed Whitewater, as I've told you personally.	1
ClaimBuster	7393	If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else.	0
ClaimBuster	7394	And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way.	1
ClaimBuster	7395	I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.	0
ClaimBuster	7396	And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.	0
ClaimBuster	7397	But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had.	0
ClaimBuster	7398	We both made promises in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	7399	The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president.	0
ClaimBuster	7400	And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.	0
ClaimBuster	7401	They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.	0
ClaimBuster	7402	And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.	1
ClaimBuster	7403	I gave you back some of that time.	0
ClaimBuster	7404	We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it.	1
ClaimBuster	7405	I consider myself in the mainstream of my party.	0
ClaimBuster	7406	I want to move forward, I want this nation to move forward.	0
ClaimBuster	7407	This man has been disparaging my plan with all this Washington fuzzy math.	0
ClaimBuster	7408	Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	7409	So you've got to create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	7410	Let's get to their questions.	0
ClaimBuster	7411	And I think there may be a couple of reasons.	0
ClaimBuster	7412	You can be on welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	7413	People will be able to take their HMO insurance company to court.	0
ClaimBuster	7414	You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.	0
ClaimBuster	7415	We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.	1
ClaimBuster	7416	They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.	0
ClaimBuster	7417	Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left.	0
ClaimBuster	7418	It's a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself.	1
ClaimBuster	7419	And, Candy, we haven't had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms we've put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed.	1
ClaimBuster	7420	First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.	0
ClaimBuster	7421	The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.	1
ClaimBuster	7422	And my opponent's plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power, and the world would be more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	7423	I wanna see our nation - return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again.	0
ClaimBuster	7424	And then we had a recession and we got attacked, which cost us 1 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	7425	And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier.	1
ClaimBuster	7426	It hasn't worked out that way.	0
ClaimBuster	7427	Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	7428	My opponent thought there was weapons there.	0
ClaimBuster	7429	A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	7430	I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith.	0
ClaimBuster	7431	It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly.	1
ClaimBuster	7432	And that is why, in this field, I have made recommendations which I am confident will move the American economy ahead - move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the Soviet Union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field.	0
ClaimBuster	7433	I think we -- I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them.	0
ClaimBuster	7434	Because someone didn't meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people.	1
ClaimBuster	7435	I think this is a very important moment for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	7436	One of the major issues in this campaign is trust.	0
ClaimBuster	7437	And if we don't act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions.	0
ClaimBuster	7438	If you're poor, they pay all of it.	1
ClaimBuster	7439	I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf.	0
ClaimBuster	7440	We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	7441	I know how to get him.	0
ClaimBuster	7442	Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs.	1
ClaimBuster	7443	We better get it right now.	0
ClaimBuster	7444	Senator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a single payer system.	1
ClaimBuster	7445	Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this.	1
ClaimBuster	7446	conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	7447	They had thirty of them; we had seven of them.	1
ClaimBuster	7448	He's 3 years into this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	7449	If you throw another 50,000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels, you're going to put a lot more out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	7450	But I think it's unconscionable, Ann, that we should be talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average Americans when there are billions out there, over $100 billion, in taxes owed that aren't being paid.	1
ClaimBuster	7451	And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	7452	Thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	7453	Look, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today.	1
ClaimBuster	7454	Freedom is on the march.	0
ClaimBuster	7455	That's Washington in a nutshell right there.	0
ClaimBuster	7456	Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support.	1
ClaimBuster	7457	It caused me to disrupt my private life and my business to get involved in this activity.	0
ClaimBuster	7458	The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that it's not enough just to help those at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	7459	I think that's a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge.	0
ClaimBuster	7460	First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.	1
ClaimBuster	7461	And to take a chance uh - now be - and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	7462	And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.	0
ClaimBuster	7463	And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.	1
ClaimBuster	7464	He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.	0
ClaimBuster	7465	And then you've got to fix it and do something with it.	0
ClaimBuster	7466	The report following the explosion of the barracks disclosed that we had not taken any of the steps that we should have taken.	1
ClaimBuster	7467	And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.	1
ClaimBuster	7468	We'll continue to reach out.	0
ClaimBuster	7469	And that's just a fact.	1
ClaimBuster	7470	But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs.	1
ClaimBuster	7471	He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	7472	But she's lied about a lot of things.	1
ClaimBuster	7473	I want to be very serious.	0
ClaimBuster	7474	On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.	0
ClaimBuster	7475	And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.	0
ClaimBuster	7476	It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	7477	But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.	0
ClaimBuster	7478	We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.	0
ClaimBuster	7479	And the sooner they start, the sooner they'll finish.	0
ClaimBuster	7480	The Arab boycott action was first taken in 1952.	1
ClaimBuster	7481	I want to say just a couple of things.	0
ClaimBuster	7482	We're spending about $7 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	7483	He had the capability of making weapons, and he would have made weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	7484	One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	7485	The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.	1
ClaimBuster	7486	We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.	1
ClaimBuster	7487	And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.	0
ClaimBuster	7488	And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...	0
ClaimBuster	7489	But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	7490	And we pushed our allies aside.	0
ClaimBuster	7491	We need to sit down and reauthorize it.	0
ClaimBuster	7492	We didn't even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957.	1
ClaimBuster	7493	But instead, we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events.	0
ClaimBuster	7494	But I think there is also a national responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	7495	I -- I'm -- I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.	0
ClaimBuster	7496	But you isolate China and turn them inward, and then we've made a tremendous mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	7497	That's the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others.	0
ClaimBuster	7498	Whether it's two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to provide for the family, whether it's a single parent who just barely pays the pressing bills or whether you're worried about an education for your children going to the best schools, or whether you're worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools, crime-free schools.	0
ClaimBuster	7499	Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.	1
ClaimBuster	7500	It's much less than that.	1
ClaimBuster	7501	And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.	0
ClaimBuster	7502	And if they don't, they wind up in prison.	0
ClaimBuster	7503	And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.	0
ClaimBuster	7504	So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	7505	Senator Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didn't meet his ideological standards.	1
ClaimBuster	7506	We have this incredible prosperity, but a lot of people have been left behind.	1
ClaimBuster	7507	If I could respond, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	7508	I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.	0
ClaimBuster	7509	And may God continue to bless our great land.	0
ClaimBuster	7510	We've had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing.	0
ClaimBuster	7511	But we were far stronger relative to the Communists five years ago, and what is of great concern is that the balance of power is in danger of moving with them.	1
ClaimBuster	7512	You can pull it off of the Internet.	0
ClaimBuster	7513	If you want to help somebody, don't run the costs up by making doctors have to have 5 or 6 tests where one would do for fear of being sued, or have somebody along the highway not stop to pick up a guy and help him because he's afraid a trial lawyer will come along and sue him.	0
ClaimBuster	7514	I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.	1
ClaimBuster	7515	Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...	0
ClaimBuster	7516	More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down.	1
ClaimBuster	7517	Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level.	0
ClaimBuster	7518	The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.	0
ClaimBuster	7519	There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reductions in our military uh - appropriation.	0
ClaimBuster	7520	We can't afford that in the next eight years and Senator Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse.	0
ClaimBuster	7521	For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn.	1
ClaimBuster	7522	Got a Republican Congress cutting spending finally and he said it's the best four years ever.	1
ClaimBuster	7523	We'll do exactly what we did in the 1990s.	0
ClaimBuster	7524	Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.	0
ClaimBuster	7525	"And I said, ""How many uh - adults here are out of work?"""	1
ClaimBuster	7526	I just disagree with Mr. Perot.	0
ClaimBuster	7527	I want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit, like President Kennedy and the Congress inaugurated in the early '60s to get industry moving again; a research and development tax credit; a low-income housing tax credit; a long-term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions.	1
ClaimBuster	7528	The uh - fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration.	0
ClaimBuster	7529	And it's just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh - a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War.	0
ClaimBuster	7530	But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama's plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	7531	Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.	0
ClaimBuster	7532	But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.	0
ClaimBuster	7533	And let me make another observation.	0
ClaimBuster	7534	But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	7535	That's the decision of the next president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	7536	"Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, ""Where is Osama bin Laden? """	1
ClaimBuster	7537	"What Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a ""stinking corpse,"" and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments."	0
ClaimBuster	7538	One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked.	0
ClaimBuster	7539	A lot of decent, honorable people felt as he did on the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	7540	Like you, I'm concerned about the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	7541	And in our country we have evolved to a point where we've put millions of innocent people in jail because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they've put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately.	0
ClaimBuster	7542	Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income.	1
ClaimBuster	7543	It's going to help jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	7544	Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.	0
ClaimBuster	7545	So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	7546	And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident.	1
ClaimBuster	7547	The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.	0
ClaimBuster	7548	So I'm pledged to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	7549	They discover great new cures and that's great.	1
ClaimBuster	7550	Well it, after World War I, we had, you know, a policy of disengagement.	1
ClaimBuster	7551	You also have investments through a Cayman's trust.	1
ClaimBuster	7552	Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	7553	No, but let me just stay to the American people in 2 and a half weeks we're going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down.	1
ClaimBuster	7554	They hack into our computers.	1
ClaimBuster	7555	The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D.	0
ClaimBuster	7556	And it's the president's fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	7557	General Ridgway has said the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	7558	But we've got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we've also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	7559	That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing.	0
ClaimBuster	7560	He and I used to have arguments about the war.	1
ClaimBuster	7561	It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.	0
ClaimBuster	7562	Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers' unions going to have to go behind.	0
ClaimBuster	7563	It's not in our national interest to use force in this case.	0
ClaimBuster	7564	Now let me come directly to your question.	0
ClaimBuster	7565	Well, you establish respect for differences.	0
ClaimBuster	7566	Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that don't like us very much.	1
ClaimBuster	7567	National security and human rights must go together.	0
ClaimBuster	7568	And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.	0
ClaimBuster	7569	And never forget, they've got Airbus over there, and it's a government-owned, privately owned, consortium across Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	7570	At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.	0
ClaimBuster	7571	And so I don't know what the answer is.	0
ClaimBuster	7572	And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.	1
ClaimBuster	7573	We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still haven't done it.	1
ClaimBuster	7574	We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras.	1
ClaimBuster	7575	Now, that's not my analysis.	0
ClaimBuster	7576	Try and get a mortgage these days.	0
ClaimBuster	7577	We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.	1
ClaimBuster	7578	I'll just give you one quick example.	0
ClaimBuster	7579	It could also be lots of other people.	0
ClaimBuster	7580	And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife.	0
ClaimBuster	7581	You see all these ads?	0
ClaimBuster	7582	17 new taxes, price controls, 50 new bureaucracies.	1
ClaimBuster	7583	I work with Director Mueller of the FBI; comes in my office when I'm in Washington every morning, talking about how to protect us.	1
ClaimBuster	7584	Now there are three crimes for every policeman.	1
ClaimBuster	7585	And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	7586	We need to have as well a strong military.	0
ClaimBuster	7587	If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	7588	I'm fighting for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	7589	I mean, you've got to care.	0
ClaimBuster	7590	To the millions of fine decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	7591	And I've had conversations with him.	1
ClaimBuster	7592	But I just have to...	0
ClaimBuster	7593	And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	7594	Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?	0
ClaimBuster	7595	If you have a child, you got tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	7596	I want to empower the people.	0
ClaimBuster	7597	Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools.	0
ClaimBuster	7598	As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time.	1
ClaimBuster	7599	It's one of the major priorities of my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	7600	This one concerned uh - Great Britain.	0
ClaimBuster	7601	Make sure that you are getting a good paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security... (CROSSTALK)	0
ClaimBuster	7602	What happened to the FBI, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	7603	Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	7604	At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	7605	So I just left some high representatives of India.	1
ClaimBuster	7606	We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place.	0
ClaimBuster	7607	Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	7608	We either have -- and by the way...	0
ClaimBuster	7609	Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	7610	"I went to a number of women's groups and said, ""Can you help us find folks,"" and they brought us whole binders full of women."	1
ClaimBuster	7611	That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again.	0
ClaimBuster	7612	You've gone up 64 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	7613	It's gone up by $2,500 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	7614	And yes, I think it's something that people need to consider.	0
ClaimBuster	7615	Another example would be the Dred Scott case, which is where judges, years ago, said that the Constitution allowed slavery because of personal property rights.	1
ClaimBuster	7616	I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.	0
ClaimBuster	7617	I don't believe we're going to go back to the Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	7618	And that state we controlled spending.	1
ClaimBuster	7619	And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.	1
ClaimBuster	7620	And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other.	0
ClaimBuster	7621	I don't want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers.	0
ClaimBuster	7622	And only the US could do this.	0
ClaimBuster	7623	She said she thought nuclear weaponry - and the control of nuclear arms.	1
ClaimBuster	7624	82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch.	1
ClaimBuster	7625	President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	7626	At the same time, regulation can become excessive.	0
ClaimBuster	7627	Sure we want family leave.	0
ClaimBuster	7628	He puts his money in the outyears, and even if he were re-elected, he'd be gone before anything would happen, and nothing is going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	7629	Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.	1
ClaimBuster	7630	That's where he was breaking the agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	7631	Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.	1
ClaimBuster	7632	So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	7633	And we've been in - on the whole, uninterested.	0
ClaimBuster	7634	They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.	1
ClaimBuster	7635	... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.	1
ClaimBuster	7636	You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska.	0
ClaimBuster	7637	I have a manufacturing jobs credit.	1
ClaimBuster	7638	Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around team of specialists who know what they're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	7639	And I think he made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	7640	I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation's interests.	0
ClaimBuster	7641	It's about your family; it's about your business, and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba.	0
ClaimBuster	7642	And we've gotten some real progress in the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	7643	This is a government that says younger workers can't possibly have their own assets.	0
ClaimBuster	7644	We cleaned up more brown fields than any other administration in my state's history, 450 of them.	1
ClaimBuster	7645	I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.	0
ClaimBuster	7646	But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted.	0
ClaimBuster	7647	I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and we're making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there.	1
ClaimBuster	7648	I notice that Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	7649	Our hearts and -- and minds go out to them.	0
ClaimBuster	7650	So the choice for America is, you can have a plan that I've laid out in four points, each of which I can tell you more about or you can go to johnkerry.com and see more of it; or you have the president's plan, which is four words: more of the same.	0
ClaimBuster	7651	I wish you would have done this.	0
ClaimBuster	7652	And may God bless the US of America.	0
ClaimBuster	7653	You won't pay a fine, because...	0
ClaimBuster	7654	The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	7655	Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now?	0
ClaimBuster	7656	Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first.	0
ClaimBuster	7657	But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.	0
ClaimBuster	7658	Our water is cleaner now.	1
ClaimBuster	7659	I would rather not critique the 2 candidates.	0
ClaimBuster	7660	When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.	0
ClaimBuster	7661	Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.	0
ClaimBuster	7662	When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.	1
ClaimBuster	7663	It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.	1
ClaimBuster	7664	There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.	0
ClaimBuster	7665	I came from very modest background.	1
ClaimBuster	7666	The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption.	0
ClaimBuster	7667	After all, it isn't paid for by my money, it isn't paid for by his, but by the people's money.	1
ClaimBuster	7668	People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	7669	I want a great relationship with China.	0
ClaimBuster	7670	That's why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same.	0
ClaimBuster	7671	The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	7672	A little child before they're 18 months learns to think well of himself or herself or poorly.	1
ClaimBuster	7673	And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	7674	This is not the America that we've known in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	7675	Well, first of all, the president's figures of $2.2 trillion just aren't accurate.	1
ClaimBuster	7676	And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him.	1
ClaimBuster	7677	their Social Security tax payments by 50%.	1
ClaimBuster	7678	Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	7679	I'm happy to have a longer conversation --	0
ClaimBuster	7680	And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	7681	And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.	0
ClaimBuster	7682	If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.	0
ClaimBuster	7683	We have to change the culture of America.	0
ClaimBuster	7684	Take a look at upstate New York.	0
ClaimBuster	7685	We went from deficit to surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	7686	But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.	0
ClaimBuster	7687	But with regard to whether Mr. Mondale would be strong, as he said he would be, I know that he has a commercial out where he's appearing on the deck of the Nimitz and watching the F - 14's take off.	1
ClaimBuster	7688	And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue.	0
ClaimBuster	7689	But let's look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	7690	The only thing consistent about my opponent's position is that he's been inconsistent.	0
ClaimBuster	7691	Could have a chance to serve as president.	0
ClaimBuster	7692	He's 10 years old now.	1
ClaimBuster	7693	Now let's just see what this means.	0
ClaimBuster	7694	I know what it's like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight.	0
ClaimBuster	7695	I'm not going to talk about a difference of character.	0
ClaimBuster	7696	That's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	7697	You got a 265 billion dollar tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	7698	My opponent says J. Danforth Quayle.	1
ClaimBuster	7699	And members of Senator Dole's own party in the Senate killed it.	1
ClaimBuster	7700	It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.	1
ClaimBuster	7701	And secondly, we've had enough fighting.	1
ClaimBuster	7702	In '17, it implodes by itself.	1
ClaimBuster	7703	This economic package is about families but it's a six-point package.	1
ClaimBuster	7704	And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs...	0
ClaimBuster	7705	We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.	0
ClaimBuster	7706	Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself.	0
ClaimBuster	7707	And I don't want to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	7708	Just a fact clarification real quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	7709	This is one of your own advisers.	1
ClaimBuster	7710	It's time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	7711	What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford.	1
ClaimBuster	7712	We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them.	0
ClaimBuster	7713	I do believe it's wrong to use a litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	7714	I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.	0
ClaimBuster	7715	Something that the vice president√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s running mate supports.	0
ClaimBuster	7716	I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.	0
ClaimBuster	7717	I don't just talk about it.	0
ClaimBuster	7718	And I was embarrassed by it.	0
ClaimBuster	7719	We've uh - ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	7720	And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	7721	And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...	0
ClaimBuster	7722	Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation of immigrants.	0
ClaimBuster	7723	But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.	0
ClaimBuster	7724	We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires -- or -- or cheap Chinese tires.	1
ClaimBuster	7725	What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families.	0
ClaimBuster	7726	I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	7727	... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.	0
ClaimBuster	7728	You picked up a $500-billion bill because of the dumb way the federal government deregulated it.	1
ClaimBuster	7729	Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.	1
ClaimBuster	7730	Secondly, we've set up what's called the -- well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.	0
ClaimBuster	7731	I readily admit I'm not going to grow the size of the federal government like he is.	0
ClaimBuster	7732	Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	7733	And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	7734	So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.	0
ClaimBuster	7735	We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the -- the wrong hands.	0
ClaimBuster	7736	The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas has mandatory emission standards, Mr. Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	7737	The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it's just a welfare program for the rich.	0
ClaimBuster	7738	I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income.	0
ClaimBuster	7739	These people are hurting in the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	7740	They had built covert facilities.	1
ClaimBuster	7741	Probably a lot of kids here disagree with me.	0
ClaimBuster	7742	Because if there's a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically.	1
ClaimBuster	7743	Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy?	0
ClaimBuster	7744	On the 2nd debate, I offered, since both sides want the enterprise zones and we can't get together, I said I'll take a few days off and go to Washington and hold hands with you and we'll get it done.	1
ClaimBuster	7745	I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.	1
ClaimBuster	7746	I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	7747	We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.	0
ClaimBuster	7748	It's going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school.	0
ClaimBuster	7749	We've got chemical warfare being conducted against our children on the streets in this country all day every day, and we don't have the will to stamp it out.	0
ClaimBuster	7750	And you have to have cost controls, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	7751	Let her release the e-mails.	0
ClaimBuster	7752	I will have a unique mandate.	0
ClaimBuster	7753	If there's one thing Africa needs it's technical assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	7754	And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	7755	And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them -- enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest.	0
ClaimBuster	7756	I'll give you one, that HMET, that heavy truck, that's cost what is it $850 million and the Pentagon didn't request it and, yet, a member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	7757	I don't believe I've used those words.	0
ClaimBuster	7758	That's where government should not be.	0
ClaimBuster	7759	First contact should be with the money when she's pregnant.	0
ClaimBuster	7760	We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	7761	I think it's a good decision--took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do.	0
ClaimBuster	7762	I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.	0
ClaimBuster	7763	Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session.	0
ClaimBuster	7764	It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it.	0
ClaimBuster	7765	I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.	1
ClaimBuster	7766	I think you're right that the polls show that the majority of Hispanics want that bill, so I'm not doing it for political reasons.	1
ClaimBuster	7767	I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	7768	The President's favorite question is: Are you better off?	0
ClaimBuster	7769	I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.	0
ClaimBuster	7770	The fact is that he's cut job-training money.	1
ClaimBuster	7771	The tax burden on them has not gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	7772	We've created a mess, don't have much to show for it and we have got to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	7773	(LAUGHTER) Just add up all the numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	7774	But, again, I want to return.	0
ClaimBuster	7775	As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they weren't able to get before.	1
ClaimBuster	7776	I have been a strong force for reform.	0
ClaimBuster	7777	Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	7778	That's what he's done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women's Act.	1
ClaimBuster	7779	the question, to sort of get a new military, get the best in the world, we got it, and they√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢re keeping the peace, and they're respected around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7780	It was my very first bill, and I'm very proud of it because it symbolizes what I think we ought to be doing.	1
ClaimBuster	7781	We reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already.	1
ClaimBuster	7782	The Natl Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon by the year 2000.	1
ClaimBuster	7783	There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity - including Red China - by the end of the presidential office in 1964.	0
ClaimBuster	7784	We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	7785	Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget.	1
ClaimBuster	7786	Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	7787	how well it could be done.	0
ClaimBuster	7788	Uhh - I believe also that uh - there is some merit to a - an amendment that uh - uh - Senator Everett Dirksen uh - proposed very frequently, an amendment that would uh - change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public schools.	0
ClaimBuster	7789	He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	7790	Well, the president's own CIA director says Saddam is stronger now than he was.	1
ClaimBuster	7791	We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.	0
ClaimBuster	7792	And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.	0
ClaimBuster	7793	I hope we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	7794	He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently.	1
ClaimBuster	7795	The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuel.	1
ClaimBuster	7796	This is a town where the White House says, Congress did it; Congress says, the White House did it.	0
ClaimBuster	7797	The -- look, I think anybody out there can check the record.	0
ClaimBuster	7798	That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.	1
ClaimBuster	7799	Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	7800	I just don't believe that's the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	7801	They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.	0
ClaimBuster	7802	That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	7803	I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7804	"But what it does say is that ""insurers, you've got to take everybody."""	0
ClaimBuster	7805	We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.	0
ClaimBuster	7806	And it's important, Jim, not only -- not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy.	0
ClaimBuster	7807	I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	7808	But that progress is only the beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	7809	In the private sector, Governor Romney's company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing.	1
ClaimBuster	7810	Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this nation that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	7811	I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform.	0
ClaimBuster	7812	When the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem, our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat.	1
ClaimBuster	7813	That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program.	0
ClaimBuster	7814	I will let the American people decide that.	0
ClaimBuster	7815	My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education.	0
ClaimBuster	7816	We said you've got -- banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements.	1
ClaimBuster	7817	I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	7818	We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium.	0
ClaimBuster	7819	Look at Lynn Martin, who's fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first-class job on it.	1
ClaimBuster	7820	We came here loving this nation, serving it, and it has served all of our most bountiful dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	7821	I voted for border security in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	7822	In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?	1
ClaimBuster	7823	We think that's very important because a lot of people take care of their parents.	1
ClaimBuster	7824	That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; it's been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	7825	He didn't do any of those things.	0
ClaimBuster	7826	There's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.	0
ClaimBuster	7827	Those are basic American values.	0
ClaimBuster	7828	This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality.	0
ClaimBuster	7829	Be strict and firm about it.	0
ClaimBuster	7830	Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes.	0
ClaimBuster	7831	And she never will change.	0
ClaimBuster	7832	We're increasing the border security of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	7833	Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer.	1
ClaimBuster	7834	We have the most expensive health care system in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	7835	[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	7836	But that's only step one.	1
ClaimBuster	7837	And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	7838	I think human life is very, very precious.	0
ClaimBuster	7839	And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.	0
ClaimBuster	7840	I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points.	0
ClaimBuster	7841	Now, if you just want to get down to brass tacks, first thing you ought to do is get all these folks who've got these 1-way trade agreements that we've negotiated over the years and say fellas, we'll take the same deal we gave you.	1
ClaimBuster	7842	Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.	1
ClaimBuster	7843	He had 16 other resolutions and nothing took place.	1
ClaimBuster	7844	They're from a fertility clinic.	1
ClaimBuster	7845	The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.	0
ClaimBuster	7846	But I believe that this Agenda for American renewal I have is the answer to do it, and I believe we can get it done now, whereas we didn't in the past, because you're going to have a whole brand new bunch of people in the Congress that are going to have to listen to the same American people I'm listening to.	0
ClaimBuster	7847	General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said you're going to need several hundred thousand troops.	1
ClaimBuster	7848	But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.	1
ClaimBuster	7849	But I want all the children -- I want these young people up here to be able to start with nothing but an idea like I did and build a business.	0
ClaimBuster	7850	They didn't volunteer the information.	1
ClaimBuster	7851	If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased.	1
ClaimBuster	7852	But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just don't believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who can't make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country.	0
ClaimBuster	7853	And it would be very difficult for me to answer that in any short period of time.	0
ClaimBuster	7854	If you're in your mid-40's under the governor's plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	7855	You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.	1
ClaimBuster	7856	Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices.	0
ClaimBuster	7857	He talks about middle-class tax cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	7858	People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people--a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years.	1
ClaimBuster	7859	I hope we'll have a chance to get into that tonight, because I can get right to the center of the bull's-eye and tell you why we're losing whole industries in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	7860	But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there.	0
ClaimBuster	7861	And they look at our country and they see what's going on.	0
ClaimBuster	7862	We had a great time.	0
ClaimBuster	7863	Number three, I'll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments.	0
ClaimBuster	7864	And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.	0
ClaimBuster	7865	Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	7866	Appreciate the sacrifices their families make.	0
ClaimBuster	7867	One of the people who's here with me today met a woman in the airport saying her son, Jess was able to be present at the birth of her child because of the Family Leave Law.	1
ClaimBuster	7868	Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	7869	I simply think it's wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards.	1
ClaimBuster	7870	He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined.	1
ClaimBuster	7871	No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	7872	Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student.	0
ClaimBuster	7873	So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives.	0
ClaimBuster	7874	In partnership with the American Health Association...	0
ClaimBuster	7875	Why take it in the first place if you're going to give it back?	0
ClaimBuster	7876	If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.	0
ClaimBuster	7877	And one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America.	0
ClaimBuster	7878	You wonder, Nikki, why it is that people don't like us in some parts of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	7879	We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.	0
ClaimBuster	7880	Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa - will there be others?	1
ClaimBuster	7881	They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.	1
ClaimBuster	7882	Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	7883	In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food.	0
ClaimBuster	7884	You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past.	0
ClaimBuster	7885	And by that I want to have child care where the families, the parents, have control.	0
ClaimBuster	7886	On the other hand, women heads of household -- single women heads of household have -- for the first time there's been a turndown in the rate of poverty for them.	1
ClaimBuster	7887	We cut the cost - the increased cost of government - in half over the eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	7888	The economy is starting downhill with housing failure -- --	1
ClaimBuster	7889	"That's the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, ""health."""	0
ClaimBuster	7890	I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what they've been willing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	7891	How can Barry Goldwater sitting in Arizona know whether I'm talking on the issues or not when we put out position paper after position paper, he puts out position paper after position paper; and we see this much about it, because everyone else is fascinated with polls and who's up or down today and who's going to be up or down tomorrow.	0
ClaimBuster	7892	We need to demand on results.	0
ClaimBuster	7893	It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	7894	Uh - Also, so that we can get the uh - opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate.	0
ClaimBuster	7895	We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...	0
ClaimBuster	7896	It is a question of leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	7897	First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.	0
ClaimBuster	7898	And it goes on and on.	0
ClaimBuster	7899	And that's one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done, because I am determined for those soldiers and for those families, for those kids who put their lives on the line.	0
ClaimBuster	7900	The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also.	0
ClaimBuster	7901	Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans?	1
ClaimBuster	7902	Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you.	0
ClaimBuster	7903	We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.	1
ClaimBuster	7904	We must not be divided on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	7905	Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?	1
ClaimBuster	7906	We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure.	0
ClaimBuster	7907	I have been for the taxpayer bill of rights all along.	1
ClaimBuster	7908	Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	1
ClaimBuster	7909	Our technicians have been working since that time in Geneva, trying to put into technical language a - an agreement that can be verified by both parties.	1
ClaimBuster	7910	It's what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like.	0
ClaimBuster	7911	Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it.	0
ClaimBuster	7912	I'm excited about our prospects as a nation.	0
ClaimBuster	7913	Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.	1
ClaimBuster	7914	We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don't need, can't afford and won't help our defense posture at all.	1
ClaimBuster	7915	He didn't take that position on Budapest.	1
ClaimBuster	7916	The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.	0
ClaimBuster	7917	It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	7918	I have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	7919	You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe.	1
ClaimBuster	7920	We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.	1
ClaimBuster	7921	If they do give us a bona fide, complete uh - accounting of the eight hundred MIA's, then I believe that the United States should begin negotiations for the uh - admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	7922	That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.	0
ClaimBuster	7923	Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	7924	In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	7925	I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	7926	Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	7927	When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that.	1
ClaimBuster	7928	We've got a good, common-sense policy.	0
ClaimBuster	7929	In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	7930	And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill.	0
ClaimBuster	7931	There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes.	1
ClaimBuster	7932	Small business is where jobs come from.	1
ClaimBuster	7933	In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.	1
ClaimBuster	7934	Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this?	0
ClaimBuster	7935	I think the American people would appreciate that.	0
ClaimBuster	7936	The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years.	1
ClaimBuster	7937	Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what we've been talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	7938	We've increased money for ammunition and weapons and pay and homeland security.	1
ClaimBuster	7939	Under the governor's plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he's modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries.	1
ClaimBuster	7940	But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.	0
ClaimBuster	7941	"And the answer is, ""Absolutely not."""	0
ClaimBuster	7942	The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasn't been exercised yet.	1
ClaimBuster	7943	We needed to go to the U.N.	0
ClaimBuster	7944	We have to have modernization, especially if we achieve the 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons that our President is taking the leadership to attain.	1
ClaimBuster	7945	And that was before the war started.	1
ClaimBuster	7946	I have to pay the administration a compliment.	0
ClaimBuster	7947	But we have some work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	7948	That is the same old argument that's gotten us into trouble on the deficit side.	0
ClaimBuster	7949	So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	7950	If we pull back in some isolation and say we don't have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we'll get involved in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	7951	Well, that's a great question.	0
ClaimBuster	7952	He says we have to move from one area of the world to another.	1
ClaimBuster	7953	So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.	0
ClaimBuster	7954	You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments.	1
ClaimBuster	7955	Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it.	0
ClaimBuster	7956	Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.	0
ClaimBuster	7957	No, it was -- we put up the American flag.	1
ClaimBuster	7958	I'll make some news in the 3rd debate.	0
ClaimBuster	7959	We provided more money for daycare in the bill that passed the senate, was vetoed, then it came back and the president signed pretty much the same bill.	1
ClaimBuster	7960	I didn't win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	7961	You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.	1
ClaimBuster	7962	And so we're matching them up.	0
ClaimBuster	7963	I have fought to cut spending.	1
ClaimBuster	7964	Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal.	1
ClaimBuster	7965	And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a president to stand up to a spending Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	7966	Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	7967	The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports.	0
ClaimBuster	7968	She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.	0
ClaimBuster	7969	I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	7970	And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s and 40√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s and more.	0
ClaimBuster	7971	But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	7972	So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it's an open invitation to others to do the same.	0
ClaimBuster	7973	I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side.	1
ClaimBuster	7974	When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.	1
ClaimBuster	7975	I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances.	0
ClaimBuster	7976	So that is my answer to this question.	0
ClaimBuster	7977	And we just have a big disagreement about this.	0
ClaimBuster	7978	That's why I want another 4 years.	0
ClaimBuster	7979	You can decide which of us you think are right.	0
ClaimBuster	7980	It wasn't thought through properly.	0
ClaimBuster	7981	But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	7982	It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships.	1
ClaimBuster	7983	I agree with that, and that's why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative.	1
ClaimBuster	7984	There are whole or this area there are whole blocks of land that are left bare, just bulldozed down flat.	1
ClaimBuster	7985	And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.	0
ClaimBuster	7986	We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.	0
ClaimBuster	7987	No, it can become out of date.	0
ClaimBuster	7988	Those things deserve to be dealt with from day one.	0
ClaimBuster	7989	I would have brought our allies to our side.	0
ClaimBuster	7990	I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.	0
ClaimBuster	7991	But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.	0
ClaimBuster	7992	That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.	0
ClaimBuster	7993	I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay.	1
ClaimBuster	7994	Now in the case of Mr. Nixon, the reason the - the pardon was given, was that, when I took office this country was in a very, very divided condition.	1
ClaimBuster	7995	I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now.	1
ClaimBuster	7996	Why pursue a strategy that would delegate to computers the question of starting a war?	0
ClaimBuster	7997	I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.	1
ClaimBuster	7998	I grew up in the segregated South, thankfully raised by a grandfather with almost no formal education but with a heart of gold who taught me early that all people were equal in the eyes of God.	1
ClaimBuster	7999	And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	8000	But that's the time when you're tested not only -- it's the time to test your mettle, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down.	0
ClaimBuster	8001	The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work.	1
ClaimBuster	8002	We've got to do that in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	8003	These are sophisticated people watching tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	8004	And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	8005	You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.	1
ClaimBuster	8006	You've got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we can't turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.	0
ClaimBuster	8007	I was going to say something...	0
ClaimBuster	8008	The amount of money that has to be raised in taxes for middle-class families to make up for completely eliminating that on the very wealthiest, the billionaires, that would be an extra heavy burden on middle-class families.	0
ClaimBuster	8009	I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.	0
ClaimBuster	8010	Our people feel that we've lost something precious.	0
ClaimBuster	8011	That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	8012	And she always will be.	0
ClaimBuster	8013	I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.	1
ClaimBuster	8014	They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.	0
ClaimBuster	8015	When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father.	1
ClaimBuster	8016	They're against the American way.	0
ClaimBuster	8017	I will accept and have accepted the recommendations of 2 proven leaders, General Colin Powell and Secretary Dick Cheney.	1
ClaimBuster	8018	And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.	1
ClaimBuster	8019	That's how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople, and that's how you gain legitimacy in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8020	Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.	1
ClaimBuster	8021	So one more effort should be made.	0
ClaimBuster	8022	I propose more than twice as much because I think it's needed.	0
ClaimBuster	8023	When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.	1
ClaimBuster	8024	And that's how we're going to be more competitive, by making sure our kids are graduating from school and college.	0
ClaimBuster	8025	And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that.	0
ClaimBuster	8026	It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?	0
ClaimBuster	8027	The question before you comes down to this: Do you want to see America return to the policies of weakness of the last 4 years?	0
ClaimBuster	8028	Senator Dole just said we had the worst economy in the century.	1
ClaimBuster	8029	And I don't have any foreign money in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	8030	I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	8031	You just know you're reading a good judicial decision.	0
ClaimBuster	8032	And businesses did very well.	0
ClaimBuster	8033	And I'll bring new competition to bring the price down.	0
ClaimBuster	8034	While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.	1
ClaimBuster	8035	That is just a downpayment, in my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	8036	That's because we believe in investing in education and in jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	8037	We've got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole.	0
ClaimBuster	8038	So we have -- as we said, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you're going to have to quit pirating our CDs, and they agreed to do things and verify that they had done it, which will make the problem much better.	1
ClaimBuster	8039	That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.	0
ClaimBuster	8040	The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made.	1
ClaimBuster	8041	And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	8042	There are two distinguished authors on arms control in this country -- there are many others, but two that I want to cite tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	8043	So I talk about the corrupt media.	0
ClaimBuster	8044	And we're going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	8045	It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.	0
ClaimBuster	8046	Just think in your own business, if you had all of your long term problems financed short term.	0
ClaimBuster	8047	So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?	0
ClaimBuster	8048	I mean, that's been done.	1
ClaimBuster	8049	I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.	0
ClaimBuster	8050	You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later.	0
ClaimBuster	8051	Where, then, do we disagree?	0
ClaimBuster	8052	That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform.	0
ClaimBuster	8053	And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	8054	Even in Iran they have had an election that began to bring about some change.	1
ClaimBuster	8055	Let's put it in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	8056	And that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition.	1
ClaimBuster	8057	I just described the coalition.	1
ClaimBuster	8058	Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.	0
ClaimBuster	8059	I served as governor and showed I could get them done.	1
ClaimBuster	8060	And people -- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I've made.	0
ClaimBuster	8061	They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	8062	We have freed other nations from dictators.	1
ClaimBuster	8063	I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.	1
ClaimBuster	8064	And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered.	1
ClaimBuster	8065	You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.	1
ClaimBuster	8066	We live in a global economy, not a national economy.	0
ClaimBuster	8067	The Duelfer report confirmed that decision today, because what Saddam Hussein was doing was trying to get rid of sanctions so he could reconstitute a weapons program.	1
ClaimBuster	8068	North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability.	1
ClaimBuster	8069	And I've made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority.	0
ClaimBuster	8070	I think the US has to still have the Statue of Liberty as a symbol, caring for others.	0
ClaimBuster	8071	They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.	1
ClaimBuster	8072	The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.	0
ClaimBuster	8073	I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.	0
ClaimBuster	8074	I have fought against it my career.	1
ClaimBuster	8075	But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 211/2 -- the prime rate.	1
ClaimBuster	8076	But I do believe that with my record in Congress, having led the new Congressmen to a code of ethics through major main emphasis on it in full disclosure, that I've got a good record.	0
ClaimBuster	8077	But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.	0
ClaimBuster	8078	I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record.	0
ClaimBuster	8079	During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	8080	Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we notify them of any uh - military maneuvers that are to be be undertaken.	1
ClaimBuster	8081	We'll continue to build strong coalitions.	0
ClaimBuster	8082	General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959.	1
ClaimBuster	8083	I'll be very proud to.	0
ClaimBuster	8084	They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.	1
ClaimBuster	8085	The problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets.	1
ClaimBuster	8086	And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we've created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone.	1
ClaimBuster	8087	When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.	1
ClaimBuster	8088	We've gotten the Americans for Disabilities Act, which I think is one of the foremost pieces of civil rights legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	8089	There√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, it's been the great honor of my life, and I've been proud to serve.	1
ClaimBuster	8090	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	8091	And likewise you've got more and more debt on your back.	0
ClaimBuster	8092	We won a majority, we didn't win the two-thirds that was necessary nor to pass that resolution, George.	1
ClaimBuster	8093	There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state.	0
ClaimBuster	8094	And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.	0
ClaimBuster	8095	Now, the difference in our plans is I want that $2,000 to go to you, and the vice president would like to be spending the $2,000 on your behalf.	1
ClaimBuster	8096	So we have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8097	And the reason I've had to do that is that he ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record.	1
ClaimBuster	8098	The president hasn't balanced a budget yet.	1
ClaimBuster	8099	Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	8100	And I -- and I honestly don't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, we've seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that.	0
ClaimBuster	8101	So I don't intend to see it undone.	0
ClaimBuster	8102	"I decided I was dumb and didn't understand it so I called a ""Who's Who"" of the folks that have been around it, and I said why won't everybody go south; they said it will be disruptive; I said for how long."	0
ClaimBuster	8103	I want us to invest in you.	0
ClaimBuster	8104	NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	8105	So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	8106	They can't pay for their prescription drugs and so they're some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	8107	And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.	0
ClaimBuster	8108	That is the kind of thing we have to do, give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children.	0
ClaimBuster	8109	And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.	1
ClaimBuster	8110	They said, let us win.	1
ClaimBuster	8111	Pretty simple, folks -- if you're paying more and you don't have the best, if all else fails go copy the people who have the best who spend less, right?	0
ClaimBuster	8112	Tell me how it's affected you again.	0
ClaimBuster	8113	Neither of them have health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	8114	I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.	1
ClaimBuster	8115	And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.	1
ClaimBuster	8116	And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.	0
ClaimBuster	8117	This is an historic time.	0
ClaimBuster	8118	As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...	0
ClaimBuster	8119	We don't need a constitutional amendment for kids to pray, and what I did was to have the justice department and the education department for the first time ever issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every school in America, saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the constitution, just because they were on a public school ground, and I think anyone who's experienced this will tell you that our administration has done more than any in years to clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including in the public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	8120	They talk, they don't get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	8121	In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be.	0
ClaimBuster	8122	I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected.	0
ClaimBuster	8123	What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money.	0
ClaimBuster	8124	We'll honor our commitment to our seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	8125	It's been there for 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	8126	It is a plan that will have 200 new programs -- expanded programs and creates 20,000 new bureaucrats.	1
ClaimBuster	8127	You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money.	0
ClaimBuster	8128	He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	8129	I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.	0
ClaimBuster	8130	Senator, no one's playing with your votes.	0
ClaimBuster	8131	Aren't you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot?	0
ClaimBuster	8132	It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.	0
ClaimBuster	8133	Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication.	1
ClaimBuster	8134	We don't have a person to waste in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	8135	I don't believe that -- did we hear the size of the fine?	0
ClaimBuster	8136	Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.	0
ClaimBuster	8137	I'm not sure what kind of view he's describing to me.	0
ClaimBuster	8138	Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	8139	So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.	0
ClaimBuster	8140	Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.	0
ClaimBuster	8141	We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	8142	But there's one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and that's parents.	0
ClaimBuster	8143	The embryo had already been destroyed prior to my decision.	1
ClaimBuster	8144	Well, could I just finish -- I think I...	0
ClaimBuster	8145	A lot of initials from a guy who's not from Washington, isn't it?	0
ClaimBuster	8146	And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	8147	And Prime Minister Koizumi is going to call countries to account, to get them to contribute.	0
ClaimBuster	8148	I'd go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one.	0
ClaimBuster	8149	I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well.	0
ClaimBuster	8150	... and reduce our violence.	0
ClaimBuster	8151	We've done that by executive order.	1
ClaimBuster	8152	But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.	1
ClaimBuster	8153	So I think the appeal is yes, we care.	0
ClaimBuster	8154	But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	8155	And you don't care about anything but making money.	0
ClaimBuster	8156	Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives.	0
ClaimBuster	8157	Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	8158	But let me -- let me come back -- we can come back.	0
ClaimBuster	8159	I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.	0
ClaimBuster	8160	I think we're going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	8161	And that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	8162	Well, let me just correct something very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	8163	You don't tell countries you're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.	0
ClaimBuster	8164	You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options.	0
ClaimBuster	8165	One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut, but people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kids, family values, that we're supposed to value so much in America -- I'm tired of politicians who talk about family values and don't value families.	1
ClaimBuster	8166	The difference is I want to bring it to 100% and he wants to bring it to 5%.	0
ClaimBuster	8167	And you pull all of it at once and read it and I did, and it's pretty clear what she and Kelly and the other key guys around that thing thought they were doing.	0
ClaimBuster	8168	And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do.	1
ClaimBuster	8169	It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us.	0
ClaimBuster	8170	Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	8171	It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda.	1
ClaimBuster	8172	I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation.	0
ClaimBuster	8173	The three priorities were health...	0
ClaimBuster	8174	People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.	0
ClaimBuster	8175	Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiest's tax burden has gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	8176	They're coming here to work.	0
ClaimBuster	8177	This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me.	1
ClaimBuster	8178	At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the western world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	8179	There may be testing in outer space.	0
ClaimBuster	8180	As a matter of fact, uh - 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	8181	I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.	1
ClaimBuster	8182	And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long-term.	0
ClaimBuster	8183	There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it's a shame it didn't pass, I think it should be made the law -- but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period.	1
ClaimBuster	8184	And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.	0
ClaimBuster	8185	To stand up straight and not scowl.	0
ClaimBuster	8186	I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.	0
ClaimBuster	8187	We've got to create the products of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	8188	You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.	1
ClaimBuster	8189	Now I'm very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind.	0
ClaimBuster	8190	I think you've got to look at how one has handled responsibility in office.	0
ClaimBuster	8191	I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	8192	Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make.	1
ClaimBuster	8193	He hasn't even made a proposal on either one.	1
ClaimBuster	8194	25th of December, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	8195	Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.	1
ClaimBuster	8196	She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.	1
ClaimBuster	8197	Now that's up to 40%.	1
ClaimBuster	8198	I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.	0
ClaimBuster	8199	He wants your kids to pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	8200	The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.	1
ClaimBuster	8201	The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks.	1
ClaimBuster	8202	It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes.	0
ClaimBuster	8203	Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	8204	The horse is up here now.	1
ClaimBuster	8205	Let me just tell you...	0
ClaimBuster	8206	But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.	0
ClaimBuster	8207	Our Guard and reserves have been turned into almost active duty.	1
ClaimBuster	8208	So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it.	0
ClaimBuster	8209	It's not the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	8210	That, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	8211	You'll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8212	We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.	0
ClaimBuster	8213	We've had free and fair elections.	1
ClaimBuster	8214	It is not and I just described it...	0
ClaimBuster	8215	We've now reduced the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by one-third.	1
ClaimBuster	8216	But that doesn't mean it wasn't a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	8217	But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8218	You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...	1
ClaimBuster	8219	I can't handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later.	0
ClaimBuster	8220	It underscores what I had to say in the Hartford debate, that there is really no foreign policy in this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	8221	But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	0
ClaimBuster	8222	First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible.	0
ClaimBuster	8223	possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	8224	What I want to find, if I am privileged to have the opportunity to do it -- and the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	8225	No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.	1
ClaimBuster	8226	It gives you the choice.	0
ClaimBuster	8227	And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	8228	I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights.	1
ClaimBuster	8229	Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn't mean that you - the government doesn't have to put out the money this year.	0
ClaimBuster	8230	We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	8231	The Freedom Support Act is something I got through the Congress, and it's a very good thing, because it does exactly what you say, and I think you agree with that, to help Russian democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	8232	I'm opposed to that, too.	0
ClaimBuster	8233	And I ask you for the privilege of leading our nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8234	It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined.	1
ClaimBuster	8235	We collect 35 cents, and we don't have it to spend.	1
ClaimBuster	8236	This is a mischaracterization of my position.	0
ClaimBuster	8237	I have proposed a managed competition plan for health care.	1
ClaimBuster	8238	The president can't order Congress around.	0
ClaimBuster	8239	This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.	0
ClaimBuster	8240	And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.	1
ClaimBuster	8241	We've stopped that practice now by measuring early.	1
ClaimBuster	8242	Now, let's balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	8243	Now, I want to build on that.	0
ClaimBuster	8244	There are 357, 000 good jobs -- manufacturing jobs, which are lost.	1
ClaimBuster	8245	He doesn't adequately fund it.	0
ClaimBuster	8246	Nor was I misleading on the day that the president decided to go to war when I said that he had made a mistake in not building strong alliances and that I would have preferred that he did more diplomacy.	1
ClaimBuster	8247	You've said publicly that it's now three times the rate of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	8248	And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	8249	I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace.	0
ClaimBuster	8250	I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.	0
ClaimBuster	8251	And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years.	1
ClaimBuster	8252	I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense.	0
ClaimBuster	8253	I'll sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change.	0
ClaimBuster	8254	I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	8255	They know it better than anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	8256	But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.	0
ClaimBuster	8257	All right, the war's over; we know he's dropping mustard gas on his own people, we know he's threatened to incinerate half of Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	8258	We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.	1
ClaimBuster	8259	Governor Romney, you did not...	0
ClaimBuster	8260	So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.	1
ClaimBuster	8261	I've been speaking out since day 1.	1
ClaimBuster	8262	I agree, we shouldn't have quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	8263	Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?	0
ClaimBuster	8264	And, number three, we've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.	0
ClaimBuster	8265	Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases.	0
ClaimBuster	8266	They just passed an electoral...	1
ClaimBuster	8267	And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.	0
ClaimBuster	8268	The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.	0
ClaimBuster	8269	That is just factually incorrect.	1
ClaimBuster	8270	... if you'll let me, Bob, just about education...	0
ClaimBuster	8271	Here's the record: We cut deficit four years in a row for the first time before the Civil War -- I mean, before World War II, and maybe before the Civil War, too.	1
ClaimBuster	8272	Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.	0
ClaimBuster	8273	And we've had great success at revenue enforcement.	0
ClaimBuster	8274	And Donald never tells you what he would do.	0
ClaimBuster	8275	You don't even know who the rebels are.	0
ClaimBuster	8276	First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.	0
ClaimBuster	8277	There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child.	0
ClaimBuster	8278	And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose.	0
ClaimBuster	8279	Therein is the best answer to her.	0
ClaimBuster	8280	I think you'll find the difference reflected in our budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	8281	That's what elections are all about.	0
ClaimBuster	8282	If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	8283	And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said.	0
ClaimBuster	8284	I want to make America great again.	0
ClaimBuster	8285	I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in poverty than four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	8286	We have, as I said, cut the taxes, but we have reduced inflation, and for 2 years now it has stayed down there, not at double digit, but in the range of 4 or below.	1
ClaimBuster	8287	Those are the questions we need answered.	0
ClaimBuster	8288	So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	8289	I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, D. C.	0
ClaimBuster	8290	It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican.	0
ClaimBuster	8291	Well, actually it's -- it's -- it's a lengthy description.	1
ClaimBuster	8292	I noticed that Governor Reagan said that when he was a young man that there was no knowledge of a racial problem in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	8293	This is the kind of change that would be made.	0
ClaimBuster	8294	His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election.	1
ClaimBuster	8295	And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.	1
ClaimBuster	8296	Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight.	0
ClaimBuster	8297	It's very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when you're busy developing a new one.	0
ClaimBuster	8298	He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U.N., pushed them away individually.	1
ClaimBuster	8299	Number 3, on the pension funds, I don't know as much about it, but I will say this.	0
ClaimBuster	8300	So this is, that's a good start.	0
ClaimBuster	8301	And I believe our troops need other allies helping.	0
ClaimBuster	8302	He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	8303	There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.	0
ClaimBuster	8304	Everybody would have been forced into managed care.	0
ClaimBuster	8305	If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9.2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	8306	Now, you asked what mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	8307	It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.	0
ClaimBuster	8308	And I made a good selection.	0
ClaimBuster	8309	And he has a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that is second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	8310	Four years later he is now promising another plan.	1
ClaimBuster	8311	They're making some progress; they need to make more.	0
ClaimBuster	8312	I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	8313	Doesn't make me popular with environmentalists.	0
ClaimBuster	8314	Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	8315	But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.	0
ClaimBuster	8316	Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.	0
ClaimBuster	8317	Doesn't work any better through the private insurers.	0
ClaimBuster	8318	It's so heavy they'd give you a broken back.	0
ClaimBuster	8319	It shows a lack of leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	8320	And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill.	1
ClaimBuster	8321	If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country.	0
ClaimBuster	8322	So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...	1
ClaimBuster	8323	Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas.	1
ClaimBuster	8324	I don't think I need any on-the-job training.	0
ClaimBuster	8325	So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around.	0
ClaimBuster	8326	The President told you in '92 he would cut it 67 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	8327	But you were not an effective senator.	0
ClaimBuster	8328	We're even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam.	1
ClaimBuster	8329	Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?	0
ClaimBuster	8330	I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	8331	In order to defend ourselves, we'd have to get international approval.	0
ClaimBuster	8332	She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.	1
ClaimBuster	8333	... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	8334	So you add it up.	0
ClaimBuster	8335	This is what we have to do.	0
ClaimBuster	8336	As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	8337	I do not say that I have made the decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	8338	"But even after we gave in and said, ""All right, let's discuss it all,'' they walked away from the table."	1
ClaimBuster	8339	As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	8340	A President has to lead his government or it won't be done.	0
ClaimBuster	8341	I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble.	0
ClaimBuster	8342	According to his own numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	8343	We're funding them √É∆í√Ç¬¢√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨≈°√Ç¬¨√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äú I wish there was more money -- but we're funding them far more than any time in the past, and we're going to keep on doing that.	1
ClaimBuster	8344	And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for.	1
ClaimBuster	8345	Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.	0
ClaimBuster	8346	Secondly, we've added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program.	1
ClaimBuster	8347	And we've got a strong family.	0
ClaimBuster	8348	She got it from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	8349	You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	8350	They don't enforce these kinds of things.	0
ClaimBuster	8351	But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.	1
ClaimBuster	8352	That's the war against terror.	0
ClaimBuster	8353	They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance.	1
ClaimBuster	8354	We've got to open up the possibilities of this research.	0
ClaimBuster	8355	I think that's a good investment.	0
ClaimBuster	8356	Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	8357	Cutting our education budget, that's not a smart choice.	0
ClaimBuster	8358	And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.	0
ClaimBuster	8359	Just go to her website.	0
ClaimBuster	8360	We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.	0
ClaimBuster	8361	They would establish a base in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	8362	They're the ones who have the challenges and they are people out there making predictions that it's not going to be the same.	0
ClaimBuster	8363	So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion.	0
ClaimBuster	8364	And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.	0
ClaimBuster	8365	And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8366	I've uh - been one who's loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there's no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	8367	Again, I√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ve supported the President on Bosnia, and I think we were told the troops would be out in a year.	1
ClaimBuster	8368	First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	8369	Now last week I guess it was Donna Shalala said well we'll cut Medicare a hundred billion and appoint a commission.	1
ClaimBuster	8370	He's a very fine research, top doctor, at the National Institute of Health, working hard doing something about research on this disease of AIDS.	1
ClaimBuster	8371	I would very much like to get our troops out of there.	0
ClaimBuster	8372	At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	8373	But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.	0
ClaimBuster	8374	I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I don't want you to let me down again.	0
ClaimBuster	8375	I think that's what leadership is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	8376	They have not done it.	1
ClaimBuster	8377	Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?	0
ClaimBuster	8378	Why do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud?	0
ClaimBuster	8379	Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations.	1
ClaimBuster	8380	And, you know, Governor Romney, I'm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	8381	Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.	1
ClaimBuster	8382	We've got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level.	0
ClaimBuster	8383	It's still the most respected credit.	0
ClaimBuster	8384	That's where I get my name.	1
ClaimBuster	8385	Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious.	0
ClaimBuster	8386	The goal here is to take back Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	8387	And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.	1
ClaimBuster	8388	And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	8389	Giving them access to higher education.	1
ClaimBuster	8390	And the only poll I've ever followed is the one that uh - you know, is taken on election day.	0
ClaimBuster	8391	I agree with that, and I did support that law.	1
ClaimBuster	8392	And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	8393	Senator Kennedy has suggested that he believes he knows the way.	1
ClaimBuster	8394	The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President's budget sought to terminate.	1
ClaimBuster	8395	You may want to focus on scandal.	0
ClaimBuster	8396	I felt very strongly about it, and I didn't want to go at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	8397	So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that's money out of the system.	1
ClaimBuster	8398	Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	8399	You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment.	1
ClaimBuster	8400	And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.	1
ClaimBuster	8401	Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.	0
ClaimBuster	8402	I've done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts.	0
ClaimBuster	8403	It's very simple for him to clear it up.	0
ClaimBuster	8404	Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.	1
ClaimBuster	8405	But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.	0
ClaimBuster	8406	It's not improving our health care system.	0
ClaimBuster	8407	I would like to see their elimination.	0
ClaimBuster	8408	I think that speaks for itself.	0
ClaimBuster	8409	Now, I have a little time left so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions; it's hard to answer these things.	0
ClaimBuster	8410	A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own.	0
ClaimBuster	8411	I saw a high school that is military.	1
ClaimBuster	8412	I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was.	1
ClaimBuster	8413	We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.	0
ClaimBuster	8414	But the top 1% will end up paying one-third of the taxes in America and they get one-fifth of the benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	8415	This one's kind of old.	1
ClaimBuster	8416	Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	8417	And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	8418	I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member.	0
ClaimBuster	8419	... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.	1
ClaimBuster	8420	"""Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal."	0
ClaimBuster	8421	And that's why I support that.	0
ClaimBuster	8422	I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.	0
ClaimBuster	8423	I have a deep religious faith.	1
ClaimBuster	8424	Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district.	0
ClaimBuster	8425	Now, I have not blocked the SALT II treaty, as Mr. Carter and Mr. Mondale suggest I have.	1
ClaimBuster	8426	I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.	1
ClaimBuster	8427	Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.	1
ClaimBuster	8428	I have devoted 24 years of my life to public service and I've said this before and I'll say it again, if you entrust me with the presidency, I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will work hard for you every day.	0
ClaimBuster	8429	But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.	1
ClaimBuster	8430	Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	8431	As a matter of fact,.	0
ClaimBuster	8432	The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process.	0
ClaimBuster	8433	We sit on a conspicuous stage.	0
ClaimBuster	8434	We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.	1
ClaimBuster	8435	You're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them.	0
ClaimBuster	8436	three ways to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8437	I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bush's labor secretary said job growth has been enormous.	1
ClaimBuster	8438	Now, many here who are not involved in farming don't -- won't follow this, so just forgive me.	0
ClaimBuster	8439	I think those are pretty important priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	8440	When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	8441	Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.	0
ClaimBuster	8442	But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.	0
ClaimBuster	8443	And we have to be very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	8444	I mean, you can like it or not like it.	0
ClaimBuster	8445	I don't think you do think that.	0
ClaimBuster	8446	You can't let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law.	0
ClaimBuster	8447	When you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that -- in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says I'm opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	8448	(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.	0
ClaimBuster	8449	I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election.	0
ClaimBuster	8450	Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.	1
ClaimBuster	8451	But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.	0
ClaimBuster	8452	I'd like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in Silicon Valley, two-thirds of whom are Republicans who said they wanted to sign on to a change in America.	1
ClaimBuster	8453	We're facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, they'll strike anywhere, with any means.	0
ClaimBuster	8454	You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate.	1
ClaimBuster	8455	Japan spends a little over 6% of its gross national product.	1
ClaimBuster	8456	It's who you trust, government or people.	0
ClaimBuster	8457	We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.	0
ClaimBuster	8458	The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	8459	Under my leadership we're going to win this war in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	8460	We talked about the economy is more important.	1
ClaimBuster	8461	Then you go to your own pharmacy.	0
ClaimBuster	8462	But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does.	0
ClaimBuster	8463	We're talking about some difference.	0
ClaimBuster	8464	But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates -- the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled -- and that's still the case today.	1
ClaimBuster	8465	They don't want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don't want just Formosa; they want the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8466	But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	8467	As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues.	1
ClaimBuster	8468	Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.	1
ClaimBuster	8469	And that's the testimony of uh - General Twining and the Assistant Secretary of State in fifty-eight.	1
ClaimBuster	8470	And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene.	1
ClaimBuster	8471	But, again, I want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again.	0
ClaimBuster	8472	Ronald Reagan was the last president...	1
ClaimBuster	8473	But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.	1
ClaimBuster	8474	And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?	0
ClaimBuster	8475	Most of all, I'd like to thank all of you who have touched me in some way over this last year, all the thousands of you whom I've seen.	0
ClaimBuster	8476	Now, as far as running away from my party is concerned, Senator Kennedy has said that we have no compassion for the poor, that we are against progress - the enemies of progress, is the term that he's used, and the like.	1
ClaimBuster	8477	They said even if we are the strongest if we don√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢t do something if we don't have a clear vision of the military, if we don't stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and I'm going to prevent that.	0
ClaimBuster	8478	We've got to strengthen the family.	0
ClaimBuster	8479	If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.	0
ClaimBuster	8480	Well, I think Governor Clinton is committed.	0
ClaimBuster	8481	I think it also is a strength.	0
ClaimBuster	8482	A President must know right then.	0
ClaimBuster	8483	The when I can't tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	8484	And it seemed to me if you want to send a signal, you've got to send a signal, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	8485	Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before.	0
ClaimBuster	8486	"Several months ago the Vietnam government said, ""We are ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on MIAs."	1
ClaimBuster	8487	And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	8488	And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.	0
ClaimBuster	8489	And therefore, I've made some proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry by more incentive going in to look for, and find, and produce oil; made some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production.	1
ClaimBuster	8490	If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.	0
ClaimBuster	8491	Of course the president will take credit for that.	0
ClaimBuster	8492	With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effort without the United States, regrettably, to begin to try to move to curb the nuclear possibilities in Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	8493	It's not only what's your philosophy and what's your position on issues, but can you get things done?	0
ClaimBuster	8494	There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.	0
ClaimBuster	8495	The Governor talks about limits, what we can't do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, we'll develop some new kind of a missile.	0
ClaimBuster	8496	And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.	1
ClaimBuster	8497	They produce the most jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	8498	In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	8499	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we still could have enterprise zones, according to both parties, but we don't.	1
ClaimBuster	8500	And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.	0
ClaimBuster	8501	Our relations with Japan have never been better.	0
ClaimBuster	8502	Now I don't know all the answers.	0
ClaimBuster	8503	We're up to $20 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	8504	We talk about fiscal matters.	0
ClaimBuster	8505	I've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first.	1
ClaimBuster	8506	When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion?	1
ClaimBuster	8507	There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.	0
ClaimBuster	8508	We're going to train troops, and we are.	0
ClaimBuster	8509	It is the bipartisan bill that is now pending in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	8510	The great contest for the presidency is about the future, who can lead, who can get things done.	0
ClaimBuster	8511	We're now working on the communications industry.	1
ClaimBuster	8512	We only have ten divisions now.	1
ClaimBuster	8513	It is something that Congress has proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	8514	But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.	0
ClaimBuster	8515	Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8516	This is not mud slinging.	0
ClaimBuster	8517	Well, we always, with the normal growth in our country and increase in population, increase the number of jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	8518	And he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the National Rifle Association.	1
ClaimBuster	8519	But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	8520	He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal.	0
ClaimBuster	8521	It was a glorious day.	0
ClaimBuster	8522	I believe experience counts, but it's not everything.	0
ClaimBuster	8523	I've seen the family values of my people in Arkansas.	0
ClaimBuster	8524	He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.	1
ClaimBuster	8525	What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification.	0
ClaimBuster	8526	And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional.	1
ClaimBuster	8527	It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform.	1
ClaimBuster	8528	We have to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	8529	But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	8530	I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	8531	And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.	1
ClaimBuster	8532	And if I'm elected president that's gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change.	0
ClaimBuster	8533	"It's the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. """	0
ClaimBuster	8534	Over the last eight years, we've seen that dream diminish.	0
ClaimBuster	8535	But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.	1
ClaimBuster	8536	And Donald knows a lot about this.	0
ClaimBuster	8537	Which is a worse decision?	0
ClaimBuster	8538	But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.	0
ClaimBuster	8539	I look forward to the final weeks of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	8540	We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.	0
ClaimBuster	8541	I'll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses.	0
ClaimBuster	8542	We can't say we're going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we're going to pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	8543	When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.	0
ClaimBuster	8544	That's how in banking it works.	0
ClaimBuster	8545	Let's vow to work together to do something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	8546	Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades.	1
ClaimBuster	8547	Look, the world's temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable.	1
ClaimBuster	8548	I'm just trying to keep up with John.	0
ClaimBuster	8549	But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we've got to think about capabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	8550	I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table.	1
ClaimBuster	8551	He was a fantastic governor of Missouri.	0
ClaimBuster	8552	And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us.	0
ClaimBuster	8553	One of the 2 groups has raised it to an art form.	1
ClaimBuster	8554	If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.	0
ClaimBuster	8555	I raise the child-care credit by $1,000 for families to help them be able to take care of their kids.	1
ClaimBuster	8556	I don't uh - look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt.	0
ClaimBuster	8557	We changed many provisions I authored, cover preexisting conditions, portability, and there are other things we can do.	1
ClaimBuster	8558	We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.	0
ClaimBuster	8559	And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare.	1
ClaimBuster	8560	-- all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered.	0
ClaimBuster	8561	And one last point I want to make.	0
ClaimBuster	8562	So we're going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	8563	I think these crimes are different.	0
ClaimBuster	8564	When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call.	1
ClaimBuster	8565	That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?	1
ClaimBuster	8566	Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.	1
ClaimBuster	8567	As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	8568	I salute those who participate in the political process.	0
ClaimBuster	8569	And I think it was Justice Black who talked about great nations, like great men, must keep their word.	0
ClaimBuster	8570	It's not taking anything away from schools, it's new money.	0
ClaimBuster	8571	And the significance of prestige, really, is because we're so identified with the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	8572	That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges.	0
ClaimBuster	8573	Will we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few?	0
ClaimBuster	8574	And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.	0
ClaimBuster	8575	And -- and -- we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they -- they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.	0
ClaimBuster	8576	That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	8577	One, we need more community health centers.	0
ClaimBuster	8578	But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.	0
ClaimBuster	8579	We're doing a little better in interdiction.	0
ClaimBuster	8580	I don't think top-down works in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8581	We need to stand for human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	8582	Well, just listen to what you heard.	0
ClaimBuster	8583	So whether it's diabetes or cancer, they come to hospitals later and it costs America more.	1
ClaimBuster	8584	I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.	0
ClaimBuster	8585	We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.	0
ClaimBuster	8586	I have a $4,000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents -- and kids, if they're earning for themselves -- to be able to pay for college.	1
ClaimBuster	8587	In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over.	0
ClaimBuster	8588	Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	8589	If you'd pass that message on to him.	0
ClaimBuster	8590	Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan.	0
ClaimBuster	8591	I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get.	0
ClaimBuster	8592	It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster.	0
ClaimBuster	8593	There was only four of us there.	1
ClaimBuster	8594	A family involves at least one parent, whether natural or adoptive or foster, and children.	1
ClaimBuster	8595	And in 12 years as governor I guess I've taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change.	1
ClaimBuster	8596	He is for registration of guns.	1
ClaimBuster	8597	And now we're fighting them now.	1
ClaimBuster	8598	Labels don't fit, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	8599	People are going to get paid.	0
ClaimBuster	8600	Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	8601	We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	8602	See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued.	0
ClaimBuster	8603	I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college.	0
ClaimBuster	8604	We ought to be shutting those down.	0
ClaimBuster	8605	Who gave it that name?	0
ClaimBuster	8606	It's not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il.	0
ClaimBuster	8607	Well, I think you're overlooking that we have had major accomplishments in the first term.	1
ClaimBuster	8608	Well, I think the fact that they're facing these repeated call-ups, some of them two and three deployments, and there's a stop- loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces.	1
ClaimBuster	8609	The Vice President talks about a thousand points of light.	1
ClaimBuster	8610	If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers?	0
ClaimBuster	8611	A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.	0
ClaimBuster	8612	I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without.	0
ClaimBuster	8613	In the last two years, I have made policy decisions involving - long-range difficulties and policies and made day-to-day judgments not only as president of the United States but as the leader of the free world What is the result of that leadership?	1
ClaimBuster	8614	And that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and a -- an effective transition so that we get Assad out.	0
ClaimBuster	8615	But this is a very liberal administration.	0
ClaimBuster	8616	You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this.	0
ClaimBuster	8617	The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and -- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.	0
ClaimBuster	8618	We ought to do that, then we can have a commission.	0
ClaimBuster	8619	"You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, ""conservative judges."""	0
ClaimBuster	8620	And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.	0
ClaimBuster	8621	It had several tax increases phased in over a period of time -- there are two more yet to come between now and 1989.	1
ClaimBuster	8622	You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.	1
ClaimBuster	8623	Do people want to be identified with us?	0
ClaimBuster	8624	I don't claim to know his heart.	1
ClaimBuster	8625	What I will do is I'll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.	0
ClaimBuster	8626	I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.	1
ClaimBuster	8627	Governor -- here -- here's -- here's one thing...	0
ClaimBuster	8628	"They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, ""Please, take them out of there.''"	1
ClaimBuster	8629	Let me, Jason, come back to you a minute because there is a big difference in the defense budget.	0
ClaimBuster	8630	And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.	0
ClaimBuster	8631	I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.	0
ClaimBuster	8632	In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.	0
ClaimBuster	8633	But he's an incumbent, and we've got to look at all the facts.	1
ClaimBuster	8634	Words matter when you run for president.	0
ClaimBuster	8635	And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	8636	People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.	1
ClaimBuster	8637	And I think now we've got a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	8638	Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.	1
ClaimBuster	8639	And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.	0
ClaimBuster	8640	We've been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	8641	I think the matter is settled once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	8642	And I've been very clear to them.	0
ClaimBuster	8643	"My message to our troops is, ""Thank you for what you're doing."	0
ClaimBuster	8644	I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.	0
ClaimBuster	8645	... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.	1
ClaimBuster	8646	Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	8647	And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need.	1
ClaimBuster	8648	I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.	1
ClaimBuster	8649	I don't think the American people believe that.	0
ClaimBuster	8650	Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull?	0
ClaimBuster	8651	So she talks about taking them out.	0
ClaimBuster	8652	The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today?	0
ClaimBuster	8653	But I have -- thanks to my mother, God rest her soul -- the firmest possible belief and faith in God.	0
ClaimBuster	8654	And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	8655	I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	8656	And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics.	1
ClaimBuster	8657	I believe in being strong and resolute and determined.	0
ClaimBuster	8658	He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	8659	But you want to know the truth?	0
ClaimBuster	8660	And in a way, I should be complaining.	0
ClaimBuster	8661	We have met your sons and daughters.	1
ClaimBuster	8662	And I don't think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today.	0
ClaimBuster	8663	Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best?	0
ClaimBuster	8664	Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, we're not getting the best cooperation in the world today.	0
ClaimBuster	8665	Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	8666	This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community.	0
ClaimBuster	8667	Nobody running can promise that, there's too much change in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8668	It's been very well studied.	1
ClaimBuster	8669	And we don't want to waste taxpayer money.	0
ClaimBuster	8670	We sent it over to the House, that you could import drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	8671	They tried to have a national health care plan.	1
ClaimBuster	8672	And that's why this election is so terribly important.	0
ClaimBuster	8673	And I suspect one of us will have a pick at the end of next year -- the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	8674	Now, I know the criticism of this.	0
ClaimBuster	8675	I'll tell the American people, but this man said I'll get you a million dollars a day in pro bono advertising, something that's very hard for the government to do.	1
ClaimBuster	8676	Let me tell you who I associate with.	0
ClaimBuster	8677	Our home initiative -- our home ownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.	1
ClaimBuster	8678	Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	8679	So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	8680	We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.	0
ClaimBuster	8681	I don't have a response.	1
ClaimBuster	8682	And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a president who can bring allies to our side.	0
ClaimBuster	8683	Governor, the people in Detroit don't forget.	0
ClaimBuster	8684	And there's just not going to be enough money.	0
ClaimBuster	8685	We can't impose it, but we need to nourish it and that's the kind of thing that I would do as president -- follow those three commitments into the future.	0
ClaimBuster	8686	So I'm not planning on making changes there.	0
ClaimBuster	8687	The FDA has made its decision.	1
ClaimBuster	8688	And so the question is how to get them going again.	0
ClaimBuster	8689	And Mr. Ford hasn't done anything about it.	1
ClaimBuster	8690	That's the way I would do it.	0
ClaimBuster	8691	The point is, they'll get to decide what to think.	0
ClaimBuster	8692	The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, we've faced a lot of opposition to them.	0
ClaimBuster	8693	I don't believe that's the way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	8694	We -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.	0
ClaimBuster	8695	The fact is that the Kyoto treaty was flawed.	0
ClaimBuster	8696	It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.	0
ClaimBuster	8697	And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.	0
ClaimBuster	8698	Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.	1
ClaimBuster	8699	Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined.	0
ClaimBuster	8700	And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.	1
ClaimBuster	8701	Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school.	1
ClaimBuster	8702	But she is absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	8703	Number two, we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; we'll take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently.	1
ClaimBuster	8704	It was very easy to do.	0
ClaimBuster	8705	And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.	0
ClaimBuster	8706	None of them uh are responsible for health care itself.	0
ClaimBuster	8707	You take the raw product you produce, I presume you're a farmer, off your farm, and you convert it.	0
ClaimBuster	8708	Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	8709	President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	8710	And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.	1
ClaimBuster	8711	And maybe it's hardly doable.	0
ClaimBuster	8712	Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	8713	Whether we're going to give our children a world-class education.	0
ClaimBuster	8714	That means he'll either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion.	0
ClaimBuster	8715	I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem.	1
ClaimBuster	8716	Well, we've gone through a tough four years.	0
ClaimBuster	8717	Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	8718	Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.	0
ClaimBuster	8719	I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.	0
ClaimBuster	8720	We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country that's coming apart at the seams.	0
ClaimBuster	8721	We've never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them.	1
ClaimBuster	8722	I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America, one of the ten largest.	1
ClaimBuster	8723	You haven't seen the commercial?	0
ClaimBuster	8724	That's not what the Constitution says.	0
ClaimBuster	8725	He talked about the reconstruction efforts that are beginning to take hold.	1
ClaimBuster	8726	Number five, champion small business.	0
ClaimBuster	8727	Some of it was excised, but the part dealing with political terrorism was continued.	0
ClaimBuster	8728	And I'm going to make it a priority.	0
ClaimBuster	8729	My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there.	1
ClaimBuster	8730	Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the president just talked about, because every part of the president's answer just now promises you more of the same over the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	8731	And so, the answer to your question is: When our general is on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that their stability and that they're on their way to, you know, a nation that's free; that's when.	0
ClaimBuster	8732	We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.	1
ClaimBuster	8733	And now we have all these people just up the road in Los Angeles County, we have people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups and tons of different religions, but the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are the same, and what I try to do is to support policies that would respect religion and then help parents inculcate those values to their children.	1
ClaimBuster	8734	Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question: Can't people be able to import drugs from Canada?	1
ClaimBuster	8735	If it says tilt, you don't get any gun.	0
ClaimBuster	8736	Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them.	1
ClaimBuster	8737	As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	8738	All I know is that we have firm government credit to guarantee the pensions.	1
ClaimBuster	8739	We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.	1
ClaimBuster	8740	We're number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	8741	Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job.	1
ClaimBuster	8742	And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn't denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined.	1
ClaimBuster	8743	We can do better than that.	0
ClaimBuster	8744	And I know that they know that I'll take care of them.	0
ClaimBuster	8745	That's going to help Jeremy get a job.	0
ClaimBuster	8746	I believe we ought to give seniors more options.	0
ClaimBuster	8747	Let me say something about Columbine.	0
ClaimBuster	8748	Well, I have no idea.	0
ClaimBuster	8749	Somebody that can come to Washington and say let's forget all the finger pointing and get positive things done on Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security, and so I take him for his word.	0
ClaimBuster	8750	I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I've discussed tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	8751	I think I've addressed it.	0
ClaimBuster	8752	We have not maintained our position and our prestige.	0
ClaimBuster	8753	I'm all for oil production.	0
ClaimBuster	8754	I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children.	0
ClaimBuster	8755	And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for.	0
ClaimBuster	8756	The worst inflation since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	8757	And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.	0
ClaimBuster	8758	This is a four-star general.	1
ClaimBuster	8759	And when she said deplorables, she meant it.	0
ClaimBuster	8760	And that begins with a strong economy here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	8761	It's been one of secrecy and exclusion.	0
ClaimBuster	8762	"And if he had been in power, in other words, if we would have said, ""Let the inspectors work, or let's, you know, hope to talk him out."	0
ClaimBuster	8763	He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	8764	You worry about the quality and the safety of your children, and the quality of education.	0
ClaimBuster	8765	I think we have to revita1ize our society.	0
ClaimBuster	8766	I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.	0
ClaimBuster	8767	I would have uh - done it opposite.	0
ClaimBuster	8768	Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.	0
ClaimBuster	8769	I wrote about that in my book...	1
ClaimBuster	8770	There won't be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet.	0
ClaimBuster	8771	Why should they insure somebody when the government's going to insure it for them?	0
ClaimBuster	8772	The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	8773	I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court.	1
ClaimBuster	8774	We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else.	1
ClaimBuster	8775	"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."""	1
ClaimBuster	8776	It's your money, it's a part of your retirement benefit.	1
ClaimBuster	8777	I understand the limited role of the federal government, but it could be a constructive role when it comes to reform, by insisting that there be a strong accountability systems.	0
ClaimBuster	8778	"One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, ""Deadly Gambits.''"	0
ClaimBuster	8779	And they want this country to go in a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	8780	My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.	1
ClaimBuster	8781	Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell.	1
ClaimBuster	8782	Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant.	1
ClaimBuster	8783	Again, see, I didn't create this problem.	1
ClaimBuster	8784	Look, I respect his children.	0
ClaimBuster	8785	He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided there'd been a miscalculation.	1
ClaimBuster	8786	She talks about health care.	1
ClaimBuster	8787	And I share them with him.	0
ClaimBuster	8788	We've spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people.	1
ClaimBuster	8789	One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.	0
ClaimBuster	8790	I don't have to worry in the near term about the Federal Reserve.	0
ClaimBuster	8791	And I honor their sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	8792	A charter school run by some people from Teach For America.	1
ClaimBuster	8793	So, yes, I told the American Legion National!	0
ClaimBuster	8794	And then we'll fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate.	0
ClaimBuster	8795	We have -- as I said, we've let government get completely out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	8796	... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.	0
ClaimBuster	8797	To destroy life to save life is -- it's one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face.	0
ClaimBuster	8798	It doesn't set a times schedule.	0
ClaimBuster	8799	What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today?	0
ClaimBuster	8800	I think it would be a great gesture.	0
ClaimBuster	8801	She doesn't have the look.	0
ClaimBuster	8802	And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.	0
ClaimBuster	8803	He apparently wants to spend billions on the MX on railroad cars, a weapons system we don't need and can't afford.	0
ClaimBuster	8804	As the politics change, his positions change.	0
ClaimBuster	8805	He wants you to believe that because he can't come here and tell you that he's created new jobs for America.	0
ClaimBuster	8806	the tone we've just heard might just be the tone we have for the rest of the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	8807	We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward.	0
ClaimBuster	8808	But what did we learn with DNC?	0
ClaimBuster	8809	The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth.	0
ClaimBuster	8810	"And I think if we get rid of the labels--and I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label ""liberal"" at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away."	0
ClaimBuster	8811	And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	8812	I don't think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8813	The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer.	1
ClaimBuster	8814	They want those civil rights laws enforced.	0
ClaimBuster	8815	It is not midnight in America, Senator.	1
ClaimBuster	8816	This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement.	1
ClaimBuster	8817	I think that that's an important part of being a parent.	0
ClaimBuster	8818	They want the equal rights amendment ratified.	0
ClaimBuster	8819	Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights.	0
ClaimBuster	8820	You know, mine doesn't work that way.	0
ClaimBuster	8821	Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	8822	In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years.	1
ClaimBuster	8823	It would only give us a few months' worth of oil and the oil wouldn't start flowing for many years into the future.	0
ClaimBuster	8824	That's twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust.	1
ClaimBuster	8825	That wasn't best for me and I knew it in the very beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	8826	Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation; and I simply will not do that.	0
ClaimBuster	8827	We got Kuwait back to the emir but he's still not his nuclear, his chemical, his bacteriological and he's still over there, right?	0
ClaimBuster	8828	That means you can take a line and cut out some of the pork out of a meaningful bill.	0
ClaimBuster	8829	He's extending the Administration's commitment.	1
ClaimBuster	8830	And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	8831	And months ago, many of us were pressing for action.	1
ClaimBuster	8832	Has an 11 year old son and can't let that son compete in sports and Little League, because he's afraid he's going to get hurt and he won't be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills.	1
ClaimBuster	8833	So more trade but on fair terms -- and favor investment in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8834	Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience.	0
ClaimBuster	8835	What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.	0
ClaimBuster	8836	One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.	0
ClaimBuster	8837	What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days.	1
ClaimBuster	8838	No, Mr. Kraft, we're spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh - by the federal government at the present time for human needs.	1
ClaimBuster	8839	I said it was a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	8840	When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has - has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	8841	Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.	1
ClaimBuster	8842	So that would be priority number one.	0
ClaimBuster	8843	Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact.	0
ClaimBuster	8844	America is not temporary; we're forever.	0
ClaimBuster	8845	They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.	1
ClaimBuster	8846	I would like our farmers feeding the world.	0
ClaimBuster	8847	That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before they're hired.	1
ClaimBuster	8848	I just think I can do that far more effectively, because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	8849	We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.	0
ClaimBuster	8850	"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind."""	1
ClaimBuster	8851	And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home.	0
ClaimBuster	8852	"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, ""proven."""	1
ClaimBuster	8853	That's one of the centerpieces of his campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	8854	There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can't afford them.	0
ClaimBuster	8855	And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.	0
ClaimBuster	8856	Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.	0
ClaimBuster	8857	A deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work.	0
ClaimBuster	8858	I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them.	0
ClaimBuster	8859	He favors this supply maintenance or production controls.	0
ClaimBuster	8860	We knew he'd been -- invaded other countries.	1
ClaimBuster	8861	If I say yes, then that means that we're reigniting the old Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	8862	Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.	1
ClaimBuster	8863	Uh - I might make a correction uh - of what uh - Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh - uh - gun control, uh - yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh - Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.	1
ClaimBuster	8864	But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there.	1
ClaimBuster	8865	Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute.	0
ClaimBuster	8866	But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?	0
ClaimBuster	8867	Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.	1
ClaimBuster	8868	Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.	0
ClaimBuster	8869	I believe what you need to do is some of what Ross is talking about: control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down.	0
ClaimBuster	8870	Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor.	1
ClaimBuster	8871	But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.	0
ClaimBuster	8872	Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more this year.	1
ClaimBuster	8873	It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.	1
ClaimBuster	8874	I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.	0
ClaimBuster	8875	It's the challenges that you don't that end up consuming most of your time.	0
ClaimBuster	8876	And that's exactly what I did.	1
ClaimBuster	8877	That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.	1
ClaimBuster	8878	It's far better for a person sitting in the White House uh - who has a number of options to make certain that the uh - other side, so to speak, doesn't know precisely what you're going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	8879	And the reason Pakistan -- the popular opinion of America had diminished in Pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator, Musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties.	1
ClaimBuster	8880	I talk to Silvio Berlusconi.	1
ClaimBuster	8881	I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.	0
ClaimBuster	8882	We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.	1
ClaimBuster	8883	I work every day with people.	1
ClaimBuster	8884	I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	8885	And I've gotten good people, like former Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin, for instance, who showed how to balance budgets and give you a good economy, to help me crunch these numbers and make them work.	1
ClaimBuster	8886	But they lead in very different directions.	0
ClaimBuster	8887	I've called for a 25% reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures.	1
ClaimBuster	8888	In his last litany of misstatements.	0
ClaimBuster	8889	As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.	1
ClaimBuster	8890	I'd rather answer her question first and then I'll be glad to.	0
ClaimBuster	8891	The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	8892	Governor Thompson of Illinois did.	1
ClaimBuster	8893	We'll give you all the equipment you need.	0
ClaimBuster	8894	So let me get to that.	0
ClaimBuster	8895	Now, forget all this talk about a draft.	0
ClaimBuster	8896	School choice -- public, private or religious.	0
ClaimBuster	8897	But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.	0
ClaimBuster	8898	We have a very different outlook.	0
ClaimBuster	8899	That's why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	8900	They create warheads, and we can't.	1
ClaimBuster	8901	Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.	0
ClaimBuster	8902	We're not going to have a draft, period.	0
ClaimBuster	8903	My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure.	0
ClaimBuster	8904	We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.	1
ClaimBuster	8905	The mission is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	8906	And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	8907	That's the most noble thing that anybody can do.	0
ClaimBuster	8908	We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	8909	Because he will not withdraw, because he's committed to these islands, because we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position.	0
ClaimBuster	8910	Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions, but it's going to be the President who's going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay.	0
ClaimBuster	8911	Governor Carter again is talking in broad generalities.	1
ClaimBuster	8912	Mr. Carter had also promised that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	8913	So seventy percent of our debt is five years or less.	1
ClaimBuster	8914	They may - are not my style.	0
ClaimBuster	8915	My friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down.	0
ClaimBuster	8916	I don't know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children -- of black children in some cities -- dropping out of high school.	1
ClaimBuster	8917	That is what I have tried to do successfully by keeping our country at peace.	0
ClaimBuster	8918	And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?	0
ClaimBuster	8919	And it's all covered in my budget from -- the plans that I've laid out -- from raising taxes on families with incomes above $200,000 and asking foreign corporations to pay the same tax that American corporations do on the same income, from $140 billion in budget cuts, including what I think are very prudent cuts in the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	8920	And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.	0
ClaimBuster	8921	Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down.	1
ClaimBuster	8922	Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	8923	That's what a president does.	0
ClaimBuster	8924	Let me talk about North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	8925	Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	8926	I will tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	8927	Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives.	1
ClaimBuster	8928	Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission.	0
ClaimBuster	8929	So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	8930	I think it ought to be a top priority.	0
ClaimBuster	8931	Energy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up.	1
ClaimBuster	8932	And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school.	0
ClaimBuster	8933	So I, we're going to do better, and we'll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party.	0
ClaimBuster	8934	They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.	0
ClaimBuster	8935	The president hasn't put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems.	1
ClaimBuster	8936	Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair?	0
ClaimBuster	8937	Bob, I think it's going to be important to just -- I'll respond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention.	0
ClaimBuster	8938	And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.	0
ClaimBuster	8939	Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.	0
ClaimBuster	8940	First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.	0
ClaimBuster	8941	I don't think he has to be a dictator.	0
ClaimBuster	8942	And that's about all I can say in a minute.	0
ClaimBuster	8943	And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.	0
ClaimBuster	8944	The financial system had frozen up.	1
ClaimBuster	8945	Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.	1
ClaimBuster	8946	And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow.	0
ClaimBuster	8947	But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.	1
ClaimBuster	8948	Jim, let me just make a point.	0
ClaimBuster	8949	And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.	0
ClaimBuster	8950	My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS -- ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim.	1
ClaimBuster	8951	When I make a mistake I say I'm sorry.	1
ClaimBuster	8952	We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban.	1
ClaimBuster	8953	Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.	0
ClaimBuster	8954	In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas.	1
ClaimBuster	8955	I will balance the budget every year.	0
ClaimBuster	8956	Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.	1
ClaimBuster	8957	Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.	1
ClaimBuster	8958	Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator.	1
ClaimBuster	8959	Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know?	0
ClaimBuster	8960	She knows how to create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	8961	Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies.	0
ClaimBuster	8962	Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something.	1
ClaimBuster	8963	Listen, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland.	0
ClaimBuster	8964	First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	8965	And I think we have a lot of earning back to do.	0
ClaimBuster	8966	We look to Europe uh - to Asia because the struggle is in the underdeveloped world.	0
ClaimBuster	8967	I don't want the talents of any American to go to waste.	0
ClaimBuster	8968	Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	8969	They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	8970	I maybe need to get a new accountant.	0
ClaimBuster	8971	Loves his family, cares about his faith.	0
ClaimBuster	8972	I think a great many of them have come out today.	0
ClaimBuster	8973	Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	8974	No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.	0
ClaimBuster	8975	So I want to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	8976	We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.	1
ClaimBuster	8977	But just tell me now; don't bury until after the election twice.	0
ClaimBuster	8978	It's a question of priorities and values.	0
ClaimBuster	8979	I made some mistakes in appointing people, but I'm not going to name them.	0
ClaimBuster	8980	I would be willing to have another debate this year.	0
ClaimBuster	8981	I've been -- but I'll nevertheless tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	8982	You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba.	0
ClaimBuster	8983	But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	8984	I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.	0
ClaimBuster	8985	But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage, yes, you could say, well, that person got 10 times as much as this other person.	1
ClaimBuster	8986	I think the matter is settled once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	8987	And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken.	0
ClaimBuster	8988	China's been cheating over the years.	1
ClaimBuster	8989	About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population.	1
ClaimBuster	8990	Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?	0
ClaimBuster	8991	Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.	0
ClaimBuster	8992	I said before, watch Ukraine.	1
ClaimBuster	8993	You know, my father came from Kenya.	1
ClaimBuster	8994	That's not in my value system, and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can walk away with another tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	8995	And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish.	0
ClaimBuster	8996	I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek - and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments.	0
ClaimBuster	8997	Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there.	1
ClaimBuster	8998	We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years.	1
ClaimBuster	8999	That's the point I made.	0
ClaimBuster	9000	So this is a show me state.	0
ClaimBuster	9001	And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	9002	She is -- she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor.	1
ClaimBuster	9003	We never would have got there if we had gone for the nuclear freeze crowd; we never would have got there if we had listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending.	0
ClaimBuster	9004	They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	9005	That's something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.	0
ClaimBuster	9006	Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator D'Amato.	1
ClaimBuster	9007	And good management in preserving the peace requires that we control the events and try to intercept before they become a crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	9008	And we have General Flynn.	1
ClaimBuster	9009	That's why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, you know: beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	9010	We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	9011	And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us.	0
ClaimBuster	9012	I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.	0
ClaimBuster	9013	"And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care."	1
ClaimBuster	9014	That's why we've got to make sure that we've got the best science and research in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9015	I have kept the faith.	0
ClaimBuster	9016	The world is changing dramatically in how we work and how we live, how we relate to each other, huge changes.	0
ClaimBuster	9017	And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part.	0
ClaimBuster	9018	For those of you making up your mind, I would be honored to have your support.	0
ClaimBuster	9019	Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.	0
ClaimBuster	9020	And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	9021	Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.	1
ClaimBuster	9022	But we also want our education to be free of federal control.	0
ClaimBuster	9023	And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.	1
ClaimBuster	9024	Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.	1
ClaimBuster	9025	I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market -- which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home -- I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively.	0
ClaimBuster	9026	We have a delicate, tight-wire walk that we must go through at the present time to make sure that we do not cozy up to tyrants, to make sure that they don't get the impression that they can suppress their people.	0
ClaimBuster	9027	Well, again, I'm running on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	9028	Her tax plan is a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	9029	So we just have a different theory.	0
ClaimBuster	9030	You'll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies.	0
ClaimBuster	9031	Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq?	0
ClaimBuster	9032	You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed.	1
ClaimBuster	9033	And I would agree that integrity is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; it's an American issue.	0
ClaimBuster	9034	Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9035	Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we've already sanctioned Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	9036	But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme which I'll say again will blow a hole in the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	9037	There isn't any doubt about that, number one.	0
ClaimBuster	9038	We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9039	In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	9040	Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9041	I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid.	0
ClaimBuster	9042	The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox.	0
ClaimBuster	9043	And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	9044	Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9045	First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections.	1
ClaimBuster	9046	But the important -- I'd like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad.	1
ClaimBuster	9047	But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.	0
ClaimBuster	9048	The American people want this environment protected.	0
ClaimBuster	9049	And that's hopeful, and that's positive.	0
ClaimBuster	9050	We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9051	And we don't have enough troops there.	0
ClaimBuster	9052	Right this very minute we're sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia.	1
ClaimBuster	9053	And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that.	0
ClaimBuster	9054	It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	9055	And there's no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people.	0
ClaimBuster	9056	And as president, I am committed to changing that.	0
ClaimBuster	9057	"There's a great passage of the Bible that says, ""What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds?"	1
ClaimBuster	9058	But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned - that specific case - to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state.	0
ClaimBuster	9059	Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	9060	But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	9061	We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	9062	I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.	0
ClaimBuster	9063	And now the federal government has become the world's greatest slum landlord.	0
ClaimBuster	9064	And we've put unprecedented trade pressure on China.	0
ClaimBuster	9065	But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child's school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren't being met.	0
ClaimBuster	9066	I've been talking about getting a capital gains cut forever, and his friends in Congress have been telling me that's a tax break for the rich.	0
ClaimBuster	9067	I'm not looking at anything now.	1
ClaimBuster	9068	Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible.	1
ClaimBuster	9069	We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	9070	The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session.	1
ClaimBuster	9071	They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	9072	Mr. Mondale, could I ask you to address the question of nuclear strategy then?	0
ClaimBuster	9073	I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.	0
ClaimBuster	9074	I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy.	0
ClaimBuster	9075	And I do have a sad note tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	9076	And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	9077	One's got a good job, one's studying to be a doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	9078	The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not.	0
ClaimBuster	9079	He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	9080	As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9081	Both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves in key roles in their campaigns.	1
ClaimBuster	9082	A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	9083	I want to be the commander in chief of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9084	When they don't pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them.	0
ClaimBuster	9085	We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	9086	There is a ravenous demand for them overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	9087	Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it.	1
ClaimBuster	9088	And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	9089	Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists, and so are the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	9090	And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	9091	I know you talked about it on the Jim, with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show.	1
ClaimBuster	9092	The bottom line is, we went in there alone.	1
ClaimBuster	9093	I think also what you need to think about is not the immediate, but what about Medicare?	0
ClaimBuster	9094	We have a commission on campaign finance reform.	1
ClaimBuster	9095	I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	9096	So long as people have input.	0
ClaimBuster	9097	Values begin at the top, in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	9098	But I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified.	0
ClaimBuster	9099	In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	9100	Senator Dole led the opposition to it.	1
ClaimBuster	9101	And I don't see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	9102	And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.	1
ClaimBuster	9103	It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.	0
ClaimBuster	9104	There is no way of anticipating what may happen.	0
ClaimBuster	9105	I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there.	1
ClaimBuster	9106	I want you to hear a problem we√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ve got here in the USA.	0
ClaimBuster	9107	I am concerned about what that does to our future.	0
ClaimBuster	9108	People didn't want to touch it for fear of getting hurt politically.	0
ClaimBuster	9109	The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972.	0
ClaimBuster	9110	A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power.	0
ClaimBuster	9111	That's the discipline we need, and I'm working for that -- to protect the American taxpayer against the big spenders.	1
ClaimBuster	9112	And the average citizen out here is just working hard every day.	0
ClaimBuster	9113	Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years.	1
ClaimBuster	9114	As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I've got a pen.	0
ClaimBuster	9115	But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.	0
ClaimBuster	9116	But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.	0
ClaimBuster	9117	I believe it does meet the test.	0
ClaimBuster	9118	I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.	0
ClaimBuster	9119	Well of course they add up.	0
ClaimBuster	9120	All over this country, they cannot even buy medicine.	0
ClaimBuster	9121	Now, I voted the way I voted because I saw that he had the policy wrong and I wanted accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	9122	Where we don't have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help.	0
ClaimBuster	9123	Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.	1
ClaimBuster	9124	I don't want to use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward.	0
ClaimBuster	9125	But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care.	1
ClaimBuster	9126	"Mr. Lodge, on ""Meet the Press"" a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident."	1
ClaimBuster	9127	And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	9128	But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children.	0
ClaimBuster	9129	In 1980, President Reagan called you a liberal for voting for Federal gun control.	1
ClaimBuster	9130	But if you're a younger worker, if you're younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise you're gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	9131	The Patriot Act is vital, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	9132	There was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way.	0
ClaimBuster	9133	We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	9134	Of course we're after Saddam Hussein -- I mean bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	9135	The time -- the time...	0
ClaimBuster	9136	But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9137	Look at the INF treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	9138	I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.	1
ClaimBuster	9139	Now, we've got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better.	0
ClaimBuster	9140	They say, what do we need this for?	0
ClaimBuster	9141	But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair.	0
ClaimBuster	9142	Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund.	1
ClaimBuster	9143	I've known him for 35 years.	1
ClaimBuster	9144	Number two, let's look at history.	0
ClaimBuster	9145	It's not an accurate one.	0
ClaimBuster	9146	And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home.	1
ClaimBuster	9147	People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system.	0
ClaimBuster	9148	He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia.	1
ClaimBuster	9149	This is uh - not compatible with the purpose of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	9150	The road to war is always paved with good intentions.	0
ClaimBuster	9151	Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?	0
ClaimBuster	9152	Let me talk about tax cuts one more time.	0
ClaimBuster	9153	They're not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America.	0
ClaimBuster	9154	We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because they'll find us guilty of illegal actions.	0
ClaimBuster	9155	We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	9156	A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996.	1
ClaimBuster	9157	Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America.	0
ClaimBuster	9158	I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.	0
ClaimBuster	9159	Maybe we can work that out.	0
ClaimBuster	9160	Uh - I began campaigning uh - twenty-two months ago.	1
ClaimBuster	9161	We passed two very forward-looking civil rights bills.	1
ClaimBuster	9162	You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavia's dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isn't going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and I'm not going to do that as commander-in-chief.	0
ClaimBuster	9163	I've had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration, and my administration is better off for it in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	9164	I believe we ought to make the system work better.	0
ClaimBuster	9165	Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	9166	You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.	0
ClaimBuster	9167	Well, Theresa (ph), thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	9168	And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.	0
ClaimBuster	9169	Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	9170	And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies.	0
ClaimBuster	9171	It's because I care about education for all of our kids.	0
ClaimBuster	9172	The middle-class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce.	1
ClaimBuster	9173	And that's something I want to lead, something we haven't had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war.	0
ClaimBuster	9174	Believe me, he's not a happy camper.	0
ClaimBuster	9175	I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway.	0
ClaimBuster	9176	So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	9177	If you are part of the -- of the bottom 20% or so of wage earners, then you will get an expanded earned income tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	9178	49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care.	1
ClaimBuster	9179	This goes to our survival.	0
ClaimBuster	9180	I think there ought to be parental notification laws.	0
ClaimBuster	9181	I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.	0
ClaimBuster	9182	I want to hold the line on taxes, and keep this the longest expansion in modern history going until everybody in America benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	9183	...I indicated that you failed to put in place a status...	1
ClaimBuster	9184	Well, this has been a tough campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	9185	And I consider that to be a very good trait.	0
ClaimBuster	9186	Well, where do you want me to begin?	0
ClaimBuster	9187	There's a lot of really good people working hard to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	9188	Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up.	0
ClaimBuster	9189	I want to change the character of the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	9190	And we have to recognize that the way they've been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	9191	Abraham Lincoln was a great president of all the people; but he was selected by his party at a key time in history because his party stood for something.	0
ClaimBuster	9192	The president's path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job.	1
ClaimBuster	9193	Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn't know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn't we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration.	0
ClaimBuster	9194	There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill.	0
ClaimBuster	9195	Actually what I've said, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	9196	But our country is innately very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	9197	It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	9198	Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	9199	Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice.	0
ClaimBuster	9200	And Mr. President, it's good to be with you again.	0
ClaimBuster	9201	And I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance, if people stay there too long.	0
ClaimBuster	9202	I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	9203	First, there's some who should be buying health care who choose not to.	0
ClaimBuster	9204	Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	9205	And the answer is I don't believe people think that's the case --	0
ClaimBuster	9206	But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won't even let us have a vote on it.	0
ClaimBuster	9207	I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people.	0
ClaimBuster	9208	I've got an obligation to make sure our government does everything we can to protect you.	0
ClaimBuster	9209	He was nominated by it.	1
ClaimBuster	9210	And this idea of unleashing a whole bunch-an army, a conventional force army, of IRS agents into everybody's kitchen I mean, he's against most defense matters, and now he wants to get an army of JRS auditors going out there.	0
ClaimBuster	9211	I want to restore a meaningful safety net.	0
ClaimBuster	9212	Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.	1
ClaimBuster	9213	I know what it takes to bring them back, and I'm going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate -- when do you graduate?	0
ClaimBuster	9214	I have met with the legislative leaders.	1
ClaimBuster	9215	As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.	1
ClaimBuster	9216	It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	9217	Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.	1
ClaimBuster	9218	Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.	1
ClaimBuster	9219	I've learned not to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	9220	And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.	0
ClaimBuster	9221	I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.	0
ClaimBuster	9222	It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9223	In Iraq, no doubt about it, it's tough.	0
ClaimBuster	9224	But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty.	1
ClaimBuster	9225	Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests.	0
ClaimBuster	9226	We are not going to spend the billions and trillions that Mr. Bush wants to spend on Star Wars.	0
ClaimBuster	9227	There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.	1
ClaimBuster	9228	I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.	0
ClaimBuster	9229	We're backing up at every way we possibly can.	0
ClaimBuster	9230	We have done a lot more, and I hope we get a chance to talk about it.	0
ClaimBuster	9231	I want to get America's economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	9232	I don't think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs.	0
ClaimBuster	9233	I have a plan to lower the cost of health care for you.	0
ClaimBuster	9234	When FDR established Social Security, they didn't call them IOUs, they called it the full faith and credit of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	9235	And they cry when they see what's happened.	0
ClaimBuster	9236	Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons.	1
ClaimBuster	9237	They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.	0
ClaimBuster	9238	That's not what we want.	0
ClaimBuster	9239	I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.	1
ClaimBuster	9240	It has some very elderly leaders that will not be around too much longer.	0
ClaimBuster	9241	And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	9242	But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.	0
ClaimBuster	9243	I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict.	0
ClaimBuster	9244	Donald wants to tear up our alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	9245	I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.	0
ClaimBuster	9246	Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	9247	There's no way to get the answer to a question.	0
ClaimBuster	9248	If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	9249	No, but he's for weakening it.	0
ClaimBuster	9250	Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker.	0
ClaimBuster	9251	Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, he is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said over his dead body before it gets renewed without being thoroughly rechecked.	1
ClaimBuster	9252	In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.	1
ClaimBuster	9253	I spent a lot of time talking to military families as well as military members all over the world and in bases all across the United States, and I became convinced after talking to the families and the personnel in uniform that we needed to not only have the pay raise but we needed to invest more in child care, housing, and other things to support families, especially when there are longer deployments because of the downsizing of the military.	1
ClaimBuster	9254	"Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, ""I will veto the DREAM Act"", that would allow these young people to have access."""	1
ClaimBuster	9255	It would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back.	0
ClaimBuster	9256	Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved.	1
ClaimBuster	9257	I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package.	0
ClaimBuster	9258	In fact, he first didn't even want to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	9259	You can see it in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	9260	Let's not raise anybody's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	9261	Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.	0
ClaimBuster	9262	Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others.	0
ClaimBuster	9263	You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.	0
ClaimBuster	9264	Why have there been these safety violations?	0
ClaimBuster	9265	He says, √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬•Well, let's concede that the administration has been doing business with Noriega.	1
ClaimBuster	9266	Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	9267	We have no growth in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9268	I believe we have to get ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	9269	And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year, he'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	9270	Well, thank you, Terry (ph).	0
ClaimBuster	9271	The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community.	1
ClaimBuster	9272	I have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Senator Feingold on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Senator Lieberman on trying to address climate change.	1
ClaimBuster	9273	If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still won't be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe.	0
ClaimBuster	9274	But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	9275	And I think it's important for us to make college affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	9276	It's a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I'm going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	9277	We're working right now in trying to be of help in southern Africa with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates, the thousands of them, from Angola.	1
ClaimBuster	9278	I've argued that we should fully funded it.	1
ClaimBuster	9279	Minority ownership of businesses are up, because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong.	1
ClaimBuster	9280	But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	9281	And in conference -- we stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee.	1
ClaimBuster	9282	I've worked on that long and hard.	1
ClaimBuster	9283	So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	9284	Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	9285	I'm going to be a president who believes in science.	0
ClaimBuster	9286	It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.	0
ClaimBuster	9287	In February he said we had the best economy in √É‚Äö 30 years, just February.	1
ClaimBuster	9288	I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000.	0
ClaimBuster	9289	My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which I'm sure we'll get to at some point.	1
ClaimBuster	9290	Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant.	0
ClaimBuster	9291	We have a government that doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	9292	As I said earlier, they don't have any ideas.	0
ClaimBuster	9293	And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.	0
ClaimBuster	9294	I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.	0
ClaimBuster	9295	That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9296	But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020.	0
ClaimBuster	9297	I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	9298	We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don't get weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	9299	I won't, I never repeat what I've talked to the President about.	0
ClaimBuster	9300	There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems.	1
ClaimBuster	9301	The Cold War is over.	1
ClaimBuster	9302	We used to -- you know, we have a goal there for minority set-aside programs, to try to encourage ownership in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	9303	And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning.	0
ClaimBuster	9304	And I want to keep it alive in child care and in other entitlements.	0
ClaimBuster	9305	Not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich.	0
ClaimBuster	9306	If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant.	0
ClaimBuster	9307	That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.	0
ClaimBuster	9308	What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.	1
ClaimBuster	9309	Look, Governor Bush, you have attacked my character and credibility and I am not going to respond in kind.	0
ClaimBuster	9310	I think the contracting business in government can help.	0
ClaimBuster	9311	And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	9312	If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again.	0
ClaimBuster	9313	Here we have our own secretary of state who has had to apologize to the world for the presentation he made to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	9314	The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon.	1
ClaimBuster	9315	The people, some way, have always understood that at a particular time a certain man was the one the country needed.	0
ClaimBuster	9316	We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture.	0
ClaimBuster	9317	So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	9318	So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	9319	I don't have any foreign lobbyists on leave in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	9320	If he, that's what he said, he's not right about that.	1
ClaimBuster	9321	After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.	1
ClaimBuster	9322	I mean, we've got big economic problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams; we're ready for a recovery.	0
ClaimBuster	9323	I notice that his task force that is working for his future plans had some of their ideas revealed in The Wall Street Journal this week.	1
ClaimBuster	9324	If you vote the other way, you will be lucky to save it.	0
ClaimBuster	9325	Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families.	1
ClaimBuster	9326	And so that's what I will do.	0
ClaimBuster	9327	Now, the three things they try to say I've changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven't.	1
ClaimBuster	9328	And, Tom, if -- if we're going to go back and forth, I then -- I'd like to have equal time to go -- to respond to...	0
ClaimBuster	9329	And we have maintained the sanctions.	1
ClaimBuster	9330	But there's also the issue of responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	9331	And that's very important to the economy, but I think we want to make certain.	0
ClaimBuster	9332	And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.	0
ClaimBuster	9333	The president said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the U.N. and go to war as a last resort.	1
ClaimBuster	9334	What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.	0
ClaimBuster	9335	The deficit is the result of excessive government spending.	1
ClaimBuster	9336	I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.	0
ClaimBuster	9337	My plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of a typical community college tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	9338	So he would have been alive today.	0
ClaimBuster	9339	Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence.	0
ClaimBuster	9340	This is part of the choice in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	9341	I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better.	0
ClaimBuster	9342	The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people.	1
ClaimBuster	9343	Are your children getting a better education.	0
ClaimBuster	9344	The president's got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years.	1
ClaimBuster	9345	Sure, there's more work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9346	Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9347	In the last month, we've had a net loss of one hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9348	We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns.	1
ClaimBuster	9349	Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	9350	"And when I hear Governor Romney say he's a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when -- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ""This plant kills,"" and took great pride in shutting it down."	1
ClaimBuster	9351	But I suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9352	Those 209 Americans last Thursday night in Richmond told us they wanted us to stop talking about each other and start talking about Americans and their problems and their promise, and I think we ought to get back to that.	1
ClaimBuster	9353	I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.	1
ClaimBuster	9354	And that's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	9355	Let's make it a strength, not a weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	9356	Well, I mentioned Third World debt.	1
ClaimBuster	9357	We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.	1
ClaimBuster	9358	If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken -- when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops.	1
ClaimBuster	9359	One is we've got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we've got to manufacture here.	0
ClaimBuster	9360	Nuclear power is safe, and it's clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9361	This is a tough campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	9362	Well, one of the very serious things that's happened in our government in recent years, and has continued up until now, is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [twenty-seven-minute delay]	0
ClaimBuster	9363	Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster.	0
ClaimBuster	9364	I am the one that said let's keep the M.F.N.	1
ClaimBuster	9365	"And you know, Senator McCain, I think the ""Straight Talk Express"" lost a wheel on that one."	0
ClaimBuster	9366	But Russia has to make the decision.	0
ClaimBuster	9367	"I can't begin to pay back my student loans."""	0
ClaimBuster	9368	I don't believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner.	0
ClaimBuster	9369	It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.	0
ClaimBuster	9370	Spending money is one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	9371	That's an area where we're going to have to work with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	9372	I respect him for showing tonight - for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me.	0
ClaimBuster	9373	Let me call your attention to the key word there.	0
ClaimBuster	9374	Well, I definitely think there are differences.	0
ClaimBuster	9375	But nevertheless, they're out there.	0
ClaimBuster	9376	This nation is the most religious nation on Earth -- more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth -- and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.	1
ClaimBuster	9377	We'll never have a balanced budget, we'll never meet the needs of our people, we'll never control the inflationary spiral, as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	9378	But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.	0
ClaimBuster	9379	I think that's part of it.	0
ClaimBuster	9380	To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	9381	But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate.	1
ClaimBuster	9382	And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	9383	I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.	0
ClaimBuster	9384	And the idea that has been suggested that I would liquidate the industry, of course not.	0
ClaimBuster	9385	We don't know what the future's going to bring.	0
ClaimBuster	9386	He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times.	1
ClaimBuster	9387	And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.	0
ClaimBuster	9388	I just want to mention if I could --	0
ClaimBuster	9389	And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	9390	I -- of course there's a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	9391	When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues.	0
ClaimBuster	9392	And we have got to put our nation back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	9393	Ross, that's a great speech, but it's not quite that simple.	0
ClaimBuster	9394	This is just another lie.	0
ClaimBuster	9395	Japan is going to have a summit for the donors; $14 billion pledged.	1
ClaimBuster	9396	I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently.	1
ClaimBuster	9397	Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	9398	On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted.	0
ClaimBuster	9399	What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	9400	Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the -- any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.	1
ClaimBuster	9401	We'll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	9402	We didn't go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time.	1
ClaimBuster	9403	"We will go with our allies."""	0
ClaimBuster	9404	He's going to tax everybody here to fund his programs.	0
ClaimBuster	9405	Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now -- the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they'll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know --	0
ClaimBuster	9406	And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.	1
ClaimBuster	9407	We have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 % over the next 4 years, but first get incentives to invest in this economy, put the American people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	9408	And, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him.	0
ClaimBuster	9409	And I do believe that we didn't gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leaders, one refused to come, to Washington D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	9410	By and large it should be local -- the more local, the better.	0
ClaimBuster	9411	The question is the means.	0
ClaimBuster	9412	You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you're paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount.	1
ClaimBuster	9413	But he didn't put in what he promised, and that makes a difference in the lives of our children.	0
ClaimBuster	9414	Neither I nor anybody else, as far a I know, agreed to give him our proxy to say that whatever he did was fine for the workers of this country and for the interests of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9415	But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	9416	I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely.	0
ClaimBuster	9417	The automobile industry is the number one market for steel.	1
ClaimBuster	9418	So it's not one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	9419	But I hope tonight you will get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what he's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	9420	If you're a small business, it's a crushing burden.	0
ClaimBuster	9421	It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	9422	If you did that you could take away the incumbents' advantage because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for House races and Senate races, and then the voters could make up their own mind without being subject to an unfair fight.	0
ClaimBuster	9423	Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.	0
ClaimBuster	9424	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.	1
ClaimBuster	9425	I am -- you know it's really interesting.	0
ClaimBuster	9426	The reason Social Security -- he says it gets 2%.	1
ClaimBuster	9427	Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right.	0
ClaimBuster	9428	It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?	0
ClaimBuster	9429	We need law and order, but we need justice, too.	0
ClaimBuster	9430	We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated.	0
ClaimBuster	9431	For those of you for me, thanks for your help.	0
ClaimBuster	9432	It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.	0
ClaimBuster	9433	I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	9434	Israel could not be blamed for that.	0
ClaimBuster	9435	I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.	0
ClaimBuster	9436	The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged.	0
ClaimBuster	9437	The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9438	The other day, I just - I'll hasten - I just saw one example.	0
ClaimBuster	9439	Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.	0
ClaimBuster	9440	We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military.	0
ClaimBuster	9441	Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...	0
ClaimBuster	9442	The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means.	1
ClaimBuster	9443	And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	9444	Well again, if you're somebody thinking about the future, I think it's fair to say that it'll be -- we'll work it out.	0
ClaimBuster	9445	I want to say, everything I ever learned about leadership I learned from a chief petty officer.	1
ClaimBuster	9446	But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.	0
ClaimBuster	9447	This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.	1
ClaimBuster	9448	And right now I have to tell you I don't think there is any excuse for the interest rates being as high as they are because we have brought inflation down so low.	0
ClaimBuster	9449	We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford's been in office two years, we've had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million.	1
ClaimBuster	9450	And we'll care for these young children.	0
ClaimBuster	9451	The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it's political patronage, stepping stones -- you get the job, give your relatives a janitor's job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week.	0
ClaimBuster	9452	How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?	0
ClaimBuster	9453	We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down.	0
ClaimBuster	9454	I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability.	0
ClaimBuster	9455	That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That's one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.	0
ClaimBuster	9456	The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	9457	And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers.	0
ClaimBuster	9458	And we have to vote it up or down, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	9459	I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth.	1
ClaimBuster	9460	I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices.	0
ClaimBuster	9461	But why start an arms race now?	0
ClaimBuster	9462	Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.	1
ClaimBuster	9463	Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	9464	Listen, we've got gun laws.	1
ClaimBuster	9465	And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children.	0
ClaimBuster	9466	Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.	1
ClaimBuster	9467	There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	9468	I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...	1
ClaimBuster	9469	We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.	0
ClaimBuster	9470	There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.	0
ClaimBuster	9471	I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.	0
ClaimBuster	9472	We've got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year.	1
ClaimBuster	9473	And my whole concept was to make America great again.	0
ClaimBuster	9474	All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.	1
ClaimBuster	9475	I think it's fitting that we're on the campus of a university tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	9476	You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	9477	I'd rather have some jobs left here than just see everything head south, see?	0
ClaimBuster	9478	It's got to be on the timetable of the people that we're trying to bring to the peace table.	0
ClaimBuster	9479	I spend a lot of time in hospitals.	1
ClaimBuster	9480	You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.	1
ClaimBuster	9481	Because you got a big tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	9482	I want to build on our strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	9483	But it's bad, bad experience.	0
ClaimBuster	9484	And we will start putting together teams to put together--to take all the plans that exist and do something with them.	0
ClaimBuster	9485	We're not moving ahead in education the way we should.	0
ClaimBuster	9486	And so budgets reflect choices.	0
ClaimBuster	9487	I'm not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	9488	Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.	1
ClaimBuster	9489	We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	9490	I've been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old.	1
ClaimBuster	9491	But the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project.	1
ClaimBuster	9492	Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition that's coming in this strong economy from the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	9493	For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you there's a 100,000 Americans who said I wish I could have asked that question.	0
ClaimBuster	9494	We gave them $1.7 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	9495	This is the history of dealing with dictators.	0
ClaimBuster	9496	And there is this pattern that has plagued him in the primaries and now about trying to have it both ways on all these issues.	0
ClaimBuster	9497	We have to make health care affordable and available.	0
ClaimBuster	9498	And the mantle of leadership for the -- promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America.	0
ClaimBuster	9499	And I've been a careful steward of your tax dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	9500	But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	9501	And I think it's important to understand what happened here.	0
ClaimBuster	9502	We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill.	0
ClaimBuster	9503	You know what he did?	0
ClaimBuster	9504	If the wrong guy is put to death, then that's a double tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	9505	She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.	1
ClaimBuster	9506	I know the threats that are made against me.	0
ClaimBuster	9507	But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we've tried every other course, if we're sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved.	0
ClaimBuster	9508	It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death.	0
ClaimBuster	9509	And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.	0
ClaimBuster	9510	I certainly hope it won't.	0
ClaimBuster	9511	And so the fundamental question of this campaign is: Who's going to keep the economy growing so people can work?	0
ClaimBuster	9512	And you know what happens?	0
ClaimBuster	9513	It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	9514	Coming out of World War II it made sense.	0
ClaimBuster	9515	Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	9516	And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.	1
ClaimBuster	9517	I'm the president that said hey, don't mess with Social Security, and we haven't.	0
ClaimBuster	9518	I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and I'll do it with five simple steps.	0
ClaimBuster	9519	Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn't going to help the economy grow.	1
ClaimBuster	9520	The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.	1
ClaimBuster	9521	Employment ought to be restored to our people.	0
ClaimBuster	9522	If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break - a tax reduction of that magnitude.	0
ClaimBuster	9523	And I'm going to get our allies back to the table.	0
ClaimBuster	9524	I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding.	0
ClaimBuster	9525	My balanced budget covers mammograms for ladies, women on Medicare and also gives respite care to the million-plus families who have someone with Alzheimer√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s.	1
ClaimBuster	9526	The people that work in Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Congress or the United States senate.	0
ClaimBuster	9527	In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows.	1
ClaimBuster	9528	And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.	1
ClaimBuster	9529	We're going to see unemployment going down, more jobs available, and the rate of inflation going down.	0
ClaimBuster	9530	In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously, before they fully materialize.	1
ClaimBuster	9531	I'm not questioning his patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	9532	They're going backwards on the definition for wetlands.	0
ClaimBuster	9533	"Both said that this administration turned down the ""walk in the woods'' agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security."	1
ClaimBuster	9534	My philosophy on taxes has been simple.	0
ClaimBuster	9535	This is one of the most important issues in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	9536	"And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy."""	1
ClaimBuster	9537	There was a chance to get this done.	0
ClaimBuster	9538	The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.	0
ClaimBuster	9539	The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.	1
ClaimBuster	9540	If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it's a public institution.	1
ClaimBuster	9541	And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families.	1
ClaimBuster	9542	We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	9543	Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back.	0
ClaimBuster	9544	It didn't hurt the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	9545	To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.	0
ClaimBuster	9546	And at the beginning of the year I had about 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	9547	I have a better plan for homeland security.	0
ClaimBuster	9548	Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	9549	That's total over the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	9550	But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.	0
ClaimBuster	9551	In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.	1
ClaimBuster	9552	There's going to be a new Congress because the old one -- I don't want to get this man made at me -- but there was a post office scandal and a bank scandal.	1
ClaimBuster	9553	Let me comment on that.	0
ClaimBuster	9554	90% of our kids go to public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	9555	You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	9556	You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9557	Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	9558	This president rushed to war, pushed our allies aside.	0
ClaimBuster	9559	You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.	0
ClaimBuster	9560	I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.	0
ClaimBuster	9561	They're trying to defeat us.	0
ClaimBuster	9562	And if we didn't tell him that, why won't we even let the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee see the written instructions for Ambassador Glaspie?	0
ClaimBuster	9563	The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	9564	Some people have a mistaken view of it in America.	0
ClaimBuster	9565	We're going to bring back law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	9566	If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	9567	The president -- 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected.	1
ClaimBuster	9568	Because look at the mess that we're in.	0
ClaimBuster	9569	Two days ago in the Oval Office, I met with the finance minister from Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	9570	Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.	1
ClaimBuster	9571	What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy.	0
ClaimBuster	9572	We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages.	1
ClaimBuster	9573	"Now, understand what this means ""without preconditions."""	0
ClaimBuster	9574	I'd be delighted to, because you can't do it the old way.	0
ClaimBuster	9575	And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours.	1
ClaimBuster	9576	And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	9577	Senator McCain continues to repeat this.	1
ClaimBuster	9578	Well, I can't say that I have roundtabled that and sat down with the Chiefs of Staff, but I have said that it seems to me that this could be a logical step in what is my ultimate goal, my ultimate dream, and that is the elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	9579	The number of uninsured has now gone up for the past seven years.	1
ClaimBuster	9580	Well, I come from the computer business, and everybody knows the women are more talented than the men.	1
ClaimBuster	9581	I understand how hard it is.	0
ClaimBuster	9582	This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.	0
ClaimBuster	9583	And I have been given great credit for what I did.	0
ClaimBuster	9584	He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume for the purpose of an - imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.	1
ClaimBuster	9585	Let's go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence.	0
ClaimBuster	9586	Under this administration we've had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other.	0
ClaimBuster	9587	Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	9588	I find that just astonishing.	0
ClaimBuster	9589	I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth.	1
ClaimBuster	9590	He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that's why his proposal didn't work.	1
ClaimBuster	9591	I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.	0
ClaimBuster	9592	I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	9593	That's what's been squeezing middle class families.	1
ClaimBuster	9594	And it's a plan that lowers cost for everybody, covers all children.	1
ClaimBuster	9595	That's the reason I decided to run for president, and I'm hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America.	0
ClaimBuster	9596	I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.	1
ClaimBuster	9597	We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.	0
ClaimBuster	9598	I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.	0
ClaimBuster	9599	Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground.	1
ClaimBuster	9600	I could have rationalized it.	0
ClaimBuster	9601	That's explicitly prohibited in the law.	1
ClaimBuster	9602	Well, I -- I do think...	0
ClaimBuster	9603	So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out.	0
ClaimBuster	9604	I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.	0
ClaimBuster	9605	Well, the record in Arkansas.	0
ClaimBuster	9606	And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	9607	Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they're good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.	0
ClaimBuster	9608	And of course, I've been talking about the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	9609	And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.	1
ClaimBuster	9610	So, look, nobody likes taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	9611	It's very important to me.	0
ClaimBuster	9612	With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to -- to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.	1
ClaimBuster	9613	And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	9614	Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	9615	Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.	0
ClaimBuster	9616	But Syria is no longer Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	9617	I have a different experience.	0
ClaimBuster	9618	They know the Democratic party won't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	9619	First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools.	1
ClaimBuster	9620	We're protecting people, they have to pay up.	0
ClaimBuster	9621	Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but it's also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	9622	And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.	1
ClaimBuster	9623	And we should be able to do that for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	9624	We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.	0
ClaimBuster	9625	And here he says he's going to be a fiscal conservative, all of a sudden.	1
ClaimBuster	9626	Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.	0
ClaimBuster	9627	And I think this will work.	0
ClaimBuster	9628	And they were graphically demonstrated again today.	0
ClaimBuster	9629	And in the first few years they either learn how to learn or don't learn how to learn.	0
ClaimBuster	9630	It's not going to be quick.	0
ClaimBuster	9631	First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...	1
ClaimBuster	9632	And I think that in that case uh - some of the more liberal uh - members of the uh - so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions.	1
ClaimBuster	9633	We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	9634	They're setting new records this year.	0
ClaimBuster	9635	Now, that also means that you've got more customers.	0
ClaimBuster	9636	There are some limited places where that was appropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	9637	Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets.	1
ClaimBuster	9638	So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.	0
ClaimBuster	9639	You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	9640	We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.	1
ClaimBuster	9641	And we'll continue to promote freedom around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	9642	Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.	0
ClaimBuster	9643	May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson -- anybody who can stand in between these three characters here and get the job done -- we owe her a round of applause.	0
ClaimBuster	9644	The Soviet Union, for instance, put pressure on Mr. Ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.	1
ClaimBuster	9645	We've got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don't have those things put away yet.	0
ClaimBuster	9646	And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now.	0
ClaimBuster	9647	And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.	1
ClaimBuster	9648	Well over a million and a quarter Americans are HIV-positive.	1
ClaimBuster	9649	You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.	0
ClaimBuster	9650	"I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like ""terrorist"" and ""kill him,"" and that you're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say ""Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line."""	1
ClaimBuster	9651	"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican."""	1
ClaimBuster	9652	The international community, the international world said this is the right thing to do, but when it came time to authorize the use of force on the Senate floor, my opponent voted against the use of force.	1
ClaimBuster	9653	I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution.	1
ClaimBuster	9654	I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated.	0
ClaimBuster	9655	It would be the largest increase in government health care ever.	0
ClaimBuster	9656	Look, we've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them.	1
ClaimBuster	9657	The vice president has a long resume.	1
ClaimBuster	9658	Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.	1
ClaimBuster	9659	In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	9660	So I don't want the implication to be that somehow everything we say is just cooked up and put in our head by somebody else.	0
ClaimBuster	9661	It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	9662	And this is why a tax reform is so important.	0
ClaimBuster	9663	Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports.	1
ClaimBuster	9664	I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B.	0
ClaimBuster	9665	General Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	9666	It's their ingenuity, I agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	9667	If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	9668	It's completely out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	9669	It wasn't a government takeover of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	9670	Well, I want to make sure we're not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obama's health care plan.	0
ClaimBuster	9671	And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer.	0
ClaimBuster	9672	And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.	0
ClaimBuster	9673	I'm proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	9674	I want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the American families.	0
ClaimBuster	9675	Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.	0
ClaimBuster	9676	I've spent my whole adult life very close to the military.	1
ClaimBuster	9677	Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody else's life?	0
ClaimBuster	9678	But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	1
ClaimBuster	9679	I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.	0
ClaimBuster	9680	But I think marriage is a sacred institution.	0
ClaimBuster	9681	They want to look good.	0
ClaimBuster	9682	Well, I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	9683	I'm not proud of any record.	0
ClaimBuster	9684	There are American jobs that are being lost.	0
ClaimBuster	9685	Plus the fact, that the special prosecutor, on his own initiation, and the attorney general on his initiation, the highest law enforcement official in this country, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.	1
ClaimBuster	9686	I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.	0
ClaimBuster	9687	As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.	0
ClaimBuster	9688	But it seems to me the record is clear.	0
ClaimBuster	9689	So military security and economic security go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	9690	We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh - energy uh - forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor.	0
ClaimBuster	9691	I owe the special interests nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	9692	It's more difficult to defend this nation.	0
ClaimBuster	9693	Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast.	0
ClaimBuster	9694	This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family.	0
ClaimBuster	9695	We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	9696	It's based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great.	1
ClaimBuster	9697	I want to give seniors who are, well, the near elderly, I don't like that term because I am just about in that category, but those 55 to 65 ought to be able to buy into Medicare for premiums that are reasonable and fair and significantly below what they have to get now.	0
ClaimBuster	9698	I'll see you tomorrow night -- (Laughter) on NBC -- 10:30 to 11:00 Eastern Time.	1
ClaimBuster	9699	And you can't just go up and say I'm going to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	9700	That's something I know how to do.	0
ClaimBuster	9701	Now, you're -- and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money.	1
ClaimBuster	9702	I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.	0
ClaimBuster	9703	That's the kind of leadership we've shown.	0
ClaimBuster	9704	But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.	0
ClaimBuster	9705	There was a big story I think in U.S.A. Today of the millions of people who have now registered because of it.	1
ClaimBuster	9706	Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	9707	The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.	0
ClaimBuster	9708	And the -- the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved?	0
ClaimBuster	9709	Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	9710	Five million jobs doesn't even keep up with our population growth.	1
ClaimBuster	9711	I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.	0
ClaimBuster	9712	We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down.	1
ClaimBuster	9713	And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.	0
ClaimBuster	9714	So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.	0
ClaimBuster	9715	We're going to have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	9716	I think once a decision has been made, it's been made unless it's proven to be unsafe to women.	0
ClaimBuster	9717	It was taken away from her.	1
ClaimBuster	9718	He -- he doesn't answer that question.	1
ClaimBuster	9719	No nation will ever have a veto over us.	0
ClaimBuster	9720	They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.	0
ClaimBuster	9721	The connection that's been made again between the deficit and the interest rates -- there is no connection between them.	1
ClaimBuster	9722	The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down.	0
ClaimBuster	9723	Well, I think it should be a right for every American.	0
ClaimBuster	9724	I favor the present depletion allowance.	0
ClaimBuster	9725	And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.	1
ClaimBuster	9726	But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly.	0
ClaimBuster	9727	But just a few years ago you said that's something you'd never do.	1
ClaimBuster	9728	Soldiers know over there that this isn't being done right yet.	0
ClaimBuster	9729	As a matter of fact, I wouldn't support it if I thought that.	0
ClaimBuster	9730	This is an administration that gave you the big tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	9731	Now, this economic package, Tim, I'm glad you asked, because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from a 15 percent across- the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit, or -- you know, estate tax relief which you're not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reduction.	0
ClaimBuster	9732	Your husband disagrees with you.	1
ClaimBuster	9733	But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies.	1
ClaimBuster	9734	We don't have to settle for what we're going through.	0
ClaimBuster	9735	So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.	0
ClaimBuster	9736	But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	9737	And institutions are beginning to function.	1
ClaimBuster	9738	I do want to make sure that -- I do want to make sure that we just understand something.	0
ClaimBuster	9739	I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished - uh - gentlemen.	1
ClaimBuster	9740	And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	9741	And not one thing did I see, with respect, on your network about my views on agriculture, and not one did I read in any newspaper.	0
ClaimBuster	9742	I want to focus on results.	0
ClaimBuster	9743	I don't know what time it is, but it's probably getting late.	0
ClaimBuster	9744	We are today subsidizing housing for more than 10 million people, and we're going to continue along that line.	1
ClaimBuster	9745	I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it.	0
ClaimBuster	9746	Well, we still are the envy of the world in terms of our military.	0
ClaimBuster	9747	We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are.	0
ClaimBuster	9748	I get audited almost every year.	1
ClaimBuster	9749	How are we going to do it?	0
ClaimBuster	9750	You heard what I was for, and that's what I support.	1
ClaimBuster	9751	But in my view, the president should have grabbed it.	0
ClaimBuster	9752	Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.	0
ClaimBuster	9753	Well, I don't have time in 30 seconds, or whatever -- a minute -- to talk about our health care reform plan.	0
ClaimBuster	9754	States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively.	1
ClaimBuster	9755	I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way.	0
ClaimBuster	9756	Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.	0
ClaimBuster	9757	Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	9758	You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.	1
ClaimBuster	9759	I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	9760	Well, let me say that I think that we might ought to review the terms, the way it works.	0
ClaimBuster	9761	When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.	1
ClaimBuster	9762	But it certainly ought to be the long-term goal of all Americans and I think it is.	0
ClaimBuster	9763	So for instance, I would not give driver's licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would.	1
ClaimBuster	9764	I think America's best days are still ahead, but we've got to build the right bridge.	0
ClaimBuster	9765	And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.	0
ClaimBuster	9766	The same is true for Michelle and I'm sure the same is true for a lot of you.	0
ClaimBuster	9767	But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.	0
ClaimBuster	9768	And what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn't being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	9769	I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it.	1
ClaimBuster	9770	Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	9771	And he put a trial lawyer on the ticket.	1
ClaimBuster	9772	Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?	0
ClaimBuster	9773	They want to judge it on the record itself.	0
ClaimBuster	9774	I think everyone's paying too much, but I think this idea that you can go out and -- then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill.	0
ClaimBuster	9775	I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	9776	Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had.	0
ClaimBuster	9777	And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	9778	I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	9779	That's what the election was about.	0
ClaimBuster	9780	But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage.	0
ClaimBuster	9781	And production on gas --	0
ClaimBuster	9782	I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign, and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question, that I would never uh - go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened.	0
ClaimBuster	9783	Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse.	0
ClaimBuster	9784	I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.	0
ClaimBuster	9785	And right now, as you know, the US took the lead in a no-fly operation up there in-- no- fly order up in the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	9786	Well, I would say that one meeting that made a profound impression on me was when the mayors of the big cities, including the mayor of Los Angeles, a Democrat, came to see me, and they unanimously said the decline in urban America stems from the decline in the American family.	1
ClaimBuster	9787	Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	9788	You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.	1
ClaimBuster	9789	I've stood up to Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	9790	But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it.	1
ClaimBuster	9791	They were choking on the sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	9792	The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them.	0
ClaimBuster	9793	I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	9794	And perhaps the biggest is world peace.	0
ClaimBuster	9795	No, but I'm glad you asked that question, because I know it's on many peoples' minds.	0
ClaimBuster	9796	We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.	1
ClaimBuster	9797	So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	9798	The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.	1
ClaimBuster	9799	We balanced the budget in the '90s.	1
ClaimBuster	9800	The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting.	0
ClaimBuster	9801	Bob, let me -- let me respond.	0
ClaimBuster	9802	If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question.	0
ClaimBuster	9803	It gets larger even with growth.	0
ClaimBuster	9804	For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.	1
ClaimBuster	9805	Recognize that we have a voluntary military.	0
ClaimBuster	9806	But don't just sit here slow dancing for 4 years doing nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	9807	We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority.	0
ClaimBuster	9808	We've opened up public lands.	1
ClaimBuster	9809	He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time.	1
ClaimBuster	9810	I'm not gonna raise taxes on middle class Americans to pay for the programs I've recommended.	0
ClaimBuster	9811	They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.	0
ClaimBuster	9812	I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult.	0
ClaimBuster	9813	You're running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	9814	He fails to point out that uh - in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	9815	And you voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	9816	You're going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.	0
ClaimBuster	9817	China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years.	1
ClaimBuster	9818	Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.	0
ClaimBuster	9819	Middle-class people, defined as people with incomes of $52,000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan-Bush years because of 6 increases in the payroll taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	9820	When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers.	1
ClaimBuster	9821	Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	9822	You know, we went on the Libyan raid -- do you remember that one?	1
ClaimBuster	9823	And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.	1
ClaimBuster	9824	And what did you do right after the election?	0
ClaimBuster	9825	If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it.	0
ClaimBuster	9826	We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.	1
ClaimBuster	9827	Number two is to cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	9828	And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family.	1
ClaimBuster	9829	22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally.	1
ClaimBuster	9830	The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job.	0
ClaimBuster	9831	I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot.	1
ClaimBuster	9832	You don't take America to war unless have the plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	9833	We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.	0
ClaimBuster	9834	We have a very divided nation.	1
ClaimBuster	9835	I said well, this is simple.	1
ClaimBuster	9836	If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.	1
ClaimBuster	9837	So why pass a law that won't fix it?	0
ClaimBuster	9838	No insult ever cleaned up a toxic waste dump or helped an elderly person.	1
ClaimBuster	9839	Of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which Senator Obama is correct on.	0
ClaimBuster	9840	It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	9841	All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.	0
ClaimBuster	9842	I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	9843	We need to have more community health centers.	0
ClaimBuster	9844	Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that's the most expensive single element in making the car.	1
ClaimBuster	9845	I cannot let this go by, the old-style Washington politics, of we're going to scare you in the voting booth.	0
ClaimBuster	9846	That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.	0
ClaimBuster	9847	And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.	1
ClaimBuster	9848	I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox.	0
ClaimBuster	9849	And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	9850	"He went so far as to call it ""brutal economics."""	1
ClaimBuster	9851	The Office of Minority Business in the Department of Commerce has made available more money in trying to help uh - black businessmen or other minority businessmen than any other administration since the office was established.	1
ClaimBuster	9852	There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.	0
ClaimBuster	9853	And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements.	0
ClaimBuster	9854	I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all.	0
ClaimBuster	9855	We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated - experience and results.	0
ClaimBuster	9856	It was a trial lawyer's dream.	0
ClaimBuster	9857	I don't appoint people I think are liberal or people who think - who I think are conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	9858	And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.	0
ClaimBuster	9859	I think the reason that we're not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold.	0
ClaimBuster	9860	Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government.	0
ClaimBuster	9861	What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.	1
ClaimBuster	9862	And you know what you'll find?	0
ClaimBuster	9863	And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people can't get car loans.	1
ClaimBuster	9864	The trillion dollars comes out of the surplus so that you can invest some of your own money.	1
ClaimBuster	9865	Now this just wasn't true.	1
ClaimBuster	9866	And I'll tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	9867	And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press.	1
ClaimBuster	9868	We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.	0
ClaimBuster	9869	I said she doesn't have the stamina.	1
ClaimBuster	9870	And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn't have previously health insurance have it now.	1
ClaimBuster	9871	We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	9872	That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.	0
ClaimBuster	9873	His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	9874	And we worked together with Democrats to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay taxes in order to make sure this economy continues to grow.	1
ClaimBuster	9875	I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.	0
ClaimBuster	9876	So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.	1
ClaimBuster	9877	Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.	0
ClaimBuster	9878	I'd like to respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	9879	Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.	0
ClaimBuster	9880	You can't get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030.	0
ClaimBuster	9881	Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.	0
ClaimBuster	9882	I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk.	0
ClaimBuster	9883	And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.	0
ClaimBuster	9884	And everybody's getting a fair shot.	0
ClaimBuster	9885	In other words, there is a growing public confidence in the strength of this economy.	1
ClaimBuster	9886	I thought it was a good program.	0
ClaimBuster	9887	Candy, I don't have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that -- they're not phantom jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	9888	Osama bin Laden isn't going to determine how we defend ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	9889	Because they understand that our military is overextended under the president.	0
ClaimBuster	9890	That's where growth will come from.	0
ClaimBuster	9891	The governor said that he doesn't think this problem is necessarily caused by people.	1
ClaimBuster	9892	I support clean coal technology.	0
ClaimBuster	9893	And we have stood on the side of democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	9894	We're living in an interconnected world.	1
ClaimBuster	9895	And I ask you to embark on that journey with me.	0
ClaimBuster	9896	That's why I fight against poverty.	0
ClaimBuster	9897	We can be once again.	0
ClaimBuster	9898	I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, it's time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	9899	Because she has been a disaster as a senator.	0
ClaimBuster	9900	We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began.	0
ClaimBuster	9901	I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	9902	I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress.	0
ClaimBuster	9903	And they know who appropriates the money.	0
ClaimBuster	9904	But I would like to use my remaining time on this exchange, Jim, to respond to an exchange that took place just a moment ago.	0
ClaimBuster	9905	Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that.	1
ClaimBuster	9906	Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.	1
ClaimBuster	9907	We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh - there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	9908	And that's why it's essential that we have strong alliances, and we do.	0
ClaimBuster	9909	I've got an agenda that I want to get done for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	9910	I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life.	0
ClaimBuster	9911	Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.	1
ClaimBuster	9912	It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.	1
ClaimBuster	9913	It had bipartisan support; it should have had bipartisan support.	1
ClaimBuster	9914	We've got them all out there.	1
ClaimBuster	9915	And I've said this to President Karzai.	1
ClaimBuster	9916	... but those other charges, as she knows, are false.	1
ClaimBuster	9917	Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	9918	I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going.	0
ClaimBuster	9919	And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	9920	If we're $4 trillion down, we should have everything perfect, but we don't.	1
ClaimBuster	9921	They see scandals almost on a daily basis.	0
ClaimBuster	9922	"I don't know how you vote ""present"" on some of that."	0
ClaimBuster	9923	Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous.	1
ClaimBuster	9924	Actually, you'd have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.	0
ClaimBuster	9925	Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	9926	Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up.	0
ClaimBuster	9927	Yes, I think we should look at the punitive and we should have some limitations.	0
ClaimBuster	9928	One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any country.	1
ClaimBuster	9929	I'm optimistic about the future.	0
ClaimBuster	9930	And education is my number one priority, because I think that it's the most important big major change that we can bring in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	9931	He doesn't take that position that I've seen so far in Laos.	0
ClaimBuster	9932	Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country.	0
ClaimBuster	9933	You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.	0
ClaimBuster	9934	Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.	1
ClaimBuster	9935	We were the first ones to put sanctions on.	1
ClaimBuster	9936	I think Mr. Benson's program has failed.	0
ClaimBuster	9937	You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever.	0
ClaimBuster	9938	The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years.	1
ClaimBuster	9939	I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.	1
ClaimBuster	9940	I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	9941	No, Morton, I don't agree to all of those things.	0
ClaimBuster	9942	Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that's what we did in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	9943	Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	9944	Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	9945	And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	9946	I've tried to find the common ground, because that's what makes us strong as Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	9947	No litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	9948	And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.	0
ClaimBuster	9949	There's no easy way to do this when you're dealing with an economy that's traditionally been more closed than one that's traditionally been more open.	0
ClaimBuster	9950	Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year, first.	1
ClaimBuster	9951	And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.	0
ClaimBuster	9952	And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.	0
ClaimBuster	9953	My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	9954	We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	9955	And we made good progress early on.	0
ClaimBuster	9956	As a matter of fact - now- I don't advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon.	0
ClaimBuster	9957	I mention the last debate --	1
ClaimBuster	9958	That's one of the big disagreements that we have with the President -- that they have not pursued the diplomatic opportunities either within El Salvador or as between the countries and have lost time during which we might have been able to achieve a peace	1
ClaimBuster	9959	We may have different approaches.	0
ClaimBuster	9960	And, America, this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	9961	I signed the partial-birth -- the ban on partial-birth abortion.	1
ClaimBuster	9962	And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.	1
ClaimBuster	9963	We keep the good faith and credit of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	9964	And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding.	1
ClaimBuster	9965	We are in a very difficult time.	0
ClaimBuster	9966	As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy.	0
ClaimBuster	9967	That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	9968	It's going to be one of the themes you hear tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	9969	We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.	0
ClaimBuster	9970	"In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq, he just said, ""The enemy attacked us."""	1
ClaimBuster	9971	He voted to increase taxes 98 times.	1
ClaimBuster	9972	Maybe that's part of the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	9973	You're not going to be targeted in or targeted out.	0
ClaimBuster	9974	I certainly agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	9975	I served at the UN.	1
ClaimBuster	9976	I would just point out, on the point Mr. Perot made, I agree that we need to cut spending in Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	9977	And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	9978	Now Governor Romney had a very different response.	1
ClaimBuster	9979	And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.	1
ClaimBuster	9980	This was just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	9981	It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms.	0
ClaimBuster	9982	"You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, ""Oh, no, there you go again, Mr."	1
ClaimBuster	9983	I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...	0
ClaimBuster	9984	One of the reasons I was successful as the governor of Texas is because I didn't try to be all things to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	9985	Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years.	0
ClaimBuster	9986	In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt said in his inaugural that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.	1
ClaimBuster	9987	And I've been out here for 13 months meeting in meetings just like this ever since October, with people like you all over America, people that have lost their jobs, lost their livelihood, lost their health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	9988	Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.	1
ClaimBuster	9989	Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	9990	I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America.	0
ClaimBuster	9991	And in the meantime, they weren't going after Al Qaida, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	9992	By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.	0
ClaimBuster	9993	We're way behind, which means Americans can't come home.	0
ClaimBuster	9994	I don't think that is a smart strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	9995	Well, let me give you some advice.	0
ClaimBuster	9996	And if you're modest income, you're worse off.	0
ClaimBuster	9997	Now, Senator McCain is also right that it's difficult.	0
ClaimBuster	9998	In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.	1
ClaimBuster	9999	We'll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	10000	Now, I believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world - not just America - perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has already indicated, the most important election in our history - it isn't the label that he wears or that I wear that counts.	1
ClaimBuster	10001	We're gonna run out of oil.	0
ClaimBuster	10002	I've had one position, one consistent position, that Saddam Hussein was a threat.	1
ClaimBuster	10003	Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.	1
ClaimBuster	10004	But everybody knew what we were doing and I've opposed that.	0
ClaimBuster	10005	This is about getting the economy moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	10006	And I think you will.	0
ClaimBuster	10007	And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	10008	Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we've forgotten the rights of the innocent.	0
ClaimBuster	10009	Right next to the last.	0
ClaimBuster	10010	So the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	10011	Congress can't order the president around.	1
ClaimBuster	10012	And you see, I think we're facing a real opportunity for world peace.	0
ClaimBuster	10013	They're not able to do it and our future depends upon it.	1
ClaimBuster	10014	But the president's been slow to do that, even in Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	10015	Margaret, once again, I don't know which George Bush I'm talking about here or looking at.	0
ClaimBuster	10016	In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends.	1
ClaimBuster	10017	Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.	0
ClaimBuster	10018	If you're happy with the system you can stay in it.	0
ClaimBuster	10019	We use something called Race to the Top.	1
ClaimBuster	10020	I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	10021	Now that is the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	10022	He talks about a grand idea: Let's have a summit; we're going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit.	1
ClaimBuster	10023	I don't really think about him very much.	0
ClaimBuster	10024	We obviously have to stop this spending spree that's going on in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	10025	There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.	1
ClaimBuster	10026	They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork.	1
ClaimBuster	10027	The United Nations was not effective at removing Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	10028	But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.	0
ClaimBuster	10029	[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?	1
ClaimBuster	10030	This uh - administration's record on environment is very bad.	0
ClaimBuster	10031	It's how we unfortunately label certain children.	1
ClaimBuster	10032	Let me tell you my position.	0
ClaimBuster	10033	And I will tell you: No, I have not.	0
ClaimBuster	10034	It becomes a tool, a corrective tool.	0
ClaimBuster	10035	We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	10036	Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.	1
ClaimBuster	10037	I asked for and received the same briefing.	1
ClaimBuster	10038	Well, we have in our economic pack, -- individual retirement accounts where we think it will encourage savings.	0
ClaimBuster	10039	He said he was optimistic when he came here, then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric and all of a sudden he was pessimistic.	0
ClaimBuster	10040	And we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and they're blowing people up.	1
ClaimBuster	10041	The President doesn't have any ideas so he's out trashing ours.	0
ClaimBuster	10042	They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program.	0
ClaimBuster	10043	And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	10044	We've got battling green eye shades.	0
ClaimBuster	10045	And what I did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe?	0
ClaimBuster	10046	We won the Olympics, in part, because we've had civil rights laws and the laws that prohibit discrimination against women.	0
ClaimBuster	10047	It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.	1
ClaimBuster	10048	I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens.	1
ClaimBuster	10049	That has not been debunked.	1
ClaimBuster	10050	That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	10051	I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that's fair.	1
ClaimBuster	10052	And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.	0
ClaimBuster	10053	We have record numbers of new small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	10054	He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.	1
ClaimBuster	10055	Boy, to listen to that -- the president, I don't think, is living in a world of reality with respect to the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	10056	We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.	0
ClaimBuster	10057	That's an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we're funding some of those programs.	0
ClaimBuster	10058	I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture.	1
ClaimBuster	10059	.... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.	0
ClaimBuster	10060	On the other hand, two years ago, I said that we've got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with.	1
ClaimBuster	10061	Every parent should know what's going on there.	0
ClaimBuster	10062	He would rather spend the family's $1800 and I would rather the Strunks spend their own money.	0
ClaimBuster	10063	And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.	0
ClaimBuster	10064	It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.	0
ClaimBuster	10065	Look, you have to build a consensus, but in some things -- Ross mentioned Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	10066	We're going to make elections.	0
ClaimBuster	10067	The Governor has to balance the budget in his state he is required to by law.	1
ClaimBuster	10068	That's saying we're cutting the rates.	1
ClaimBuster	10069	We may have different approaches.	0
ClaimBuster	10070	You may have said that, too.	0
ClaimBuster	10071	I am a son of a Methodist minister.	1
ClaimBuster	10072	We can make it move.	0
ClaimBuster	10073	Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.	0
ClaimBuster	10074	He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything.	1
ClaimBuster	10075	And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present.	0
ClaimBuster	10076	This is 1980 and not 1966.	1
ClaimBuster	10077	Now, just for the record, I don't have any spin doctors.	1
ClaimBuster	10078	Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.	0
ClaimBuster	10079	That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...	1
ClaimBuster	10080	We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.	1
ClaimBuster	10081	Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	10082	I remember the night before I became Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	10083	It has been a good, lively exchange.	0
ClaimBuster	10084	I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country.	1
ClaimBuster	10085	That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.	0
ClaimBuster	10086	And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent.	0
ClaimBuster	10087	And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform.	0
ClaimBuster	10088	What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.	0
ClaimBuster	10089	And abroad, we're at war.	1
ClaimBuster	10090	Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	0
ClaimBuster	10091	We've got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	10092	But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.	0
ClaimBuster	10093	And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10094	Chris Reeve exercises every single day to keep those muscles alive for the day when he believes he can walk again, and I want him to walk again.	1
ClaimBuster	10095	But all this by itself is not enough.	0
ClaimBuster	10096	China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	10097	I want to do something about Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	10098	We suggested -- I think it has been over a year ago now -- we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick.	1
ClaimBuster	10099	I've worked hard in the State of Texas to make sure our institutions reflect the state with good, smart policy.	0
ClaimBuster	10100	But I've supported Medicare ever since.	1
ClaimBuster	10101	America owes you a debt of gratitude.	0
ClaimBuster	10102	You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.	0
ClaimBuster	10103	I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did--and I applaud that.	1
ClaimBuster	10104	Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.	0
ClaimBuster	10105	The matter has been thoroughly looked into.	0
ClaimBuster	10106	That's been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.	0
ClaimBuster	10107	He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.	1
ClaimBuster	10108	They're a member of the axis of evil.	0
ClaimBuster	10109	And I want to make sure the outcome honors that nobility.	0
ClaimBuster	10110	I know that the CIA is already going forward with one.	1
ClaimBuster	10111	It would ruin the quality of health care in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10112	It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that God's given us in the greatest nation on earth - the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	10113	"First thing I'm going to do,"" despite the fact that it's the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well."	1
ClaimBuster	10114	And I will invest in education, health care, protecting the environment and retirement security.	0
ClaimBuster	10115	General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	10116	The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence.	0
ClaimBuster	10117	I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	10118	Four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	10119	We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production.	1
ClaimBuster	10120	Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	10121	We're going to make it affordable and accessible.	0
ClaimBuster	10122	They don't want us to control it, very candidly.	0
ClaimBuster	10123	Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.	0
ClaimBuster	10124	And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.	0
ClaimBuster	10125	And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.	0
ClaimBuster	10126	And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that's not the case.	0
ClaimBuster	10127	I know how to win.	0
ClaimBuster	10128	By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, who's been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obama's depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue.	1
ClaimBuster	10129	Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.	0
ClaimBuster	10130	Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said.	0
ClaimBuster	10131	I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources.	0
ClaimBuster	10132	We have inflation because the Government is living too well.	0
ClaimBuster	10133	The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10134	I'd like to mention one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10135	We've got to put an end to that.	0
ClaimBuster	10136	"I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, ""Vote for me because I'm a Democrat."""	0
ClaimBuster	10137	But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers?	0
ClaimBuster	10138	The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	10139	(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.	0
ClaimBuster	10140	My word is my bond.	0
ClaimBuster	10141	Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy.	1
ClaimBuster	10142	And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.	0
ClaimBuster	10143	I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.	0
ClaimBuster	10144	And he will not advise me in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	10145	I've done more to eliminate Affirmative Action programs I didn't think were fair and tighten others up than my predecessors have, since affirmative action's been around.	1
ClaimBuster	10146	You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators.	1
ClaimBuster	10147	And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	10148	We also need to hold on to equal pay.	0
ClaimBuster	10149	They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we've been focused on Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	10150	I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit.	0
ClaimBuster	10151	You've been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine.	0
ClaimBuster	10152	I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	10153	If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	10154	But let me just tell you my position on guns in general, sir, if you don't mind.	0
ClaimBuster	10155	Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here.	0
ClaimBuster	10156	But I've always said trickle-down government is bad.	1
ClaimBuster	10157	My priority is putting people back to work in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10158	And that's what's happening in Afghanistan and Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	10159	During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation.	1
ClaimBuster	10160	I don't believe Mr. Perot feels this way, but I know Governor Clinton did because I want to accurately quote him.	0
ClaimBuster	10161	We haven't got 12 days, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	10162	And that's why the FDA and that's why the surgeon general are looking very carefully to make sure it can be done in a safe way.	1
ClaimBuster	10163	Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon.	1
ClaimBuster	10164	"When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, ""Any place, any time,"" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas."	1
ClaimBuster	10165	And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	10166	And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids.	1
ClaimBuster	10167	Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	10168	This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.	1
ClaimBuster	10169	Put a head fake on us.	0
ClaimBuster	10170	We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.	1
ClaimBuster	10171	It happened because I could work with people -- Republicans and Democrats.	1
ClaimBuster	10172	Again, if you're not rich, you're not a superpower.	0
ClaimBuster	10173	The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	10174	You see, I want the families to have the choice.	0
ClaimBuster	10175	We have written agreements and we have some missiles that have been destroyed, but we have a huge number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are still in place in Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	10176	Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?	0
ClaimBuster	10177	President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.	1
ClaimBuster	10178	Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	10179	And we've got too much government and too much spending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	10180	This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	10181	But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money.	0
ClaimBuster	10182	And then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	10183	We are sitting on a ticking time bomb folks, because we have totally mismanaged our country, and we had better get it back under control.	0
ClaimBuster	10184	So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	10185	I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	10186	"It isn't enough for him to say ""I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution."""	0
ClaimBuster	10187	And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.	0
ClaimBuster	10188	Everybody who pays taxes ought to get some relief.	0
ClaimBuster	10189	I think we ought to be looking at modernization, I think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on land, and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	10190	I've been involved myself in negotiating and helping to move along the negotiations with the Internet service providers to get a parents' protection page every time 95% of the pages come up.	1
ClaimBuster	10191	We've got seven and a half million people out of jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	10192	And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.	0
ClaimBuster	10193	And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	10194	All I say is this.	0
ClaimBuster	10195	Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn't a handout.	1
ClaimBuster	10196	Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart ally -- the Shah of Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	10197	I would pick somebody who would not allow their personal opinion to get in the way of the law.	0
ClaimBuster	10198	I am not going to commit US forces until I know what the mission is, till the military tell me that it can be completed, and till I know how they can come out.	0
ClaimBuster	10199	And Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea, with nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	10200	And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.	1
ClaimBuster	10201	People look to the President of the United States more than any other person in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10202	Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	10203	I think this is the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	10204	We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.	0
ClaimBuster	10205	So that is where my income limit would trigger.	0
ClaimBuster	10206	But we can't kill our way out of this mess.	0
ClaimBuster	10207	And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	10208	Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad.	1
ClaimBuster	10209	And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet build-up, which has been going forward at a rapid pace, and for quite some time.	1
ClaimBuster	10210	So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.	0
ClaimBuster	10211	He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.	1
ClaimBuster	10212	I don't think it's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10213	Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core.	0
ClaimBuster	10214	What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.	1
ClaimBuster	10215	And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	10216	She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.	0
ClaimBuster	10217	I never thought I'd ever be involved in anything like this.	0
ClaimBuster	10218	You're judged by the entire record.	0
ClaimBuster	10219	I don't like to see the country's principles violated.	0
ClaimBuster	10220	And this is the greatest country on Earth.	0
ClaimBuster	10221	But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	10222	And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don't work, we should cut.	0
ClaimBuster	10223	Well, thank you for the question.	0
ClaimBuster	10224	There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six.	1
ClaimBuster	10225	I think she's a terrific person...	0
ClaimBuster	10226	You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	10227	This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.	1
ClaimBuster	10228	What I don't accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country's at war.	0
ClaimBuster	10229	By the way, when I'm subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee.	0
ClaimBuster	10230	... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.	1
ClaimBuster	10231	(Laughter) And so our America 2000 program also says this.	0
ClaimBuster	10232	He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.	1
ClaimBuster	10233	We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.	0
ClaimBuster	10234	The third thing I would say -- it doesn't bear directly on gun control, but it's very important -- we need more police on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	10235	We were on one side; they were on the other side.	1
ClaimBuster	10236	Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back.	0
ClaimBuster	10237	I think it shows the difference between the two parties.	0
ClaimBuster	10238	And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.	1
ClaimBuster	10239	Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.	0
ClaimBuster	10240	We opened a great opportunity in l972, which has pretty well been frittered - frit- frittered away under Mr. Ford, that ought to be a constant uh - inclination toward - uh - toward friendship.	0
ClaimBuster	10241	My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.	0
ClaimBuster	10242	That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	10243	And we're of course going to have to consider the costs.	0
ClaimBuster	10244	But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make.	0
ClaimBuster	10245	The future will be the greatest time in this country's history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10246	Well, I hope I made my answer clear.	0
ClaimBuster	10247	And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.	0
ClaimBuster	10248	I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and here's how it works.	0
ClaimBuster	10249	So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.	1
ClaimBuster	10250	You don't measure it by a percentage increase.	0
ClaimBuster	10251	Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	10252	There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled.	1
ClaimBuster	10253	I do know what he has said about mine.	1
ClaimBuster	10254	There will be a job-sucking sound going south.	0
ClaimBuster	10255	We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden.	1
ClaimBuster	10256	There's not a more important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	10257	And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.	1
ClaimBuster	10258	Well, let me just say -- let me just say.	0
ClaimBuster	10259	And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.	0
ClaimBuster	10260	I want to change those provisions.	0
ClaimBuster	10261	There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.	0
ClaimBuster	10262	We agree on a couple of things on education.	1
ClaimBuster	10263	And the president chose the wrong way.	0
ClaimBuster	10264	We need a hundred thousand more police on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	10265	And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	10266	First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.	1
ClaimBuster	10267	Let me go back a minute to racial divisiveness.	0
ClaimBuster	10268	There is a difference with what the president did in Kosovo which I supported and this.	1
ClaimBuster	10269	In the last five pres- vice presidential uh - nominees, uh - incumbents, three of them have become president.	1
ClaimBuster	10270	They'll never be the same.	0
ClaimBuster	10271	Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear.	0
ClaimBuster	10272	We've got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans, who've been involved, in their initiative.	1
ClaimBuster	10273	The Vice President is right, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	10274	Now those are the wrong priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	10275	I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another - and the United States must not spread itself too thinly - that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam - but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences.	0
ClaimBuster	10276	And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes.	0
ClaimBuster	10277	Actually, I understand it pretty well.	0
ClaimBuster	10278	I was the floor manager.	1
ClaimBuster	10279	Surely we can send 5% back to you that pay the bills.	0
ClaimBuster	10280	If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	10281	That is an outrageous claim.	0
ClaimBuster	10282	Every debate I bring this up, and nobody ever addresses it.	1
ClaimBuster	10283	If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less.	0
ClaimBuster	10284	As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patient's bill of rights through.	1
ClaimBuster	10285	One I don't have a list yet.	0
ClaimBuster	10286	And I'm going to spend what it takes to win the war, more than just $120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	10287	It's called the automated check or the instant check.	1
ClaimBuster	10288	No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you.	0
ClaimBuster	10289	And if you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me, I do.	0
ClaimBuster	10290	First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low.	0
ClaimBuster	10291	Now, Social Security has never done that.	1
ClaimBuster	10292	We want -- we want to make sure that we're seeing progress throughout the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	10293	First, we ought to prevent more of this on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	10294	We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	10295	Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.	1
ClaimBuster	10296	But I think that it's important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that, and that we do have interests there.	0
ClaimBuster	10297	We're spending $1 billion to come up with the technologies to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	10298	And they're showing up in Iraq for the same reason.	0
ClaimBuster	10299	Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for and let them decide whether they're going to support me or not.	0
ClaimBuster	10300	But let's look at the facts here.	0
ClaimBuster	10301	From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	10302	We need to deal with managed care.	0
ClaimBuster	10303	It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh - party that was in power.	0
ClaimBuster	10304	We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	10305	And so does Michael Feinberg.	0
ClaimBuster	10306	It helped lead me through a war, leads me today.	0
ClaimBuster	10307	Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support.	1
ClaimBuster	10308	What's he say to Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland?	0
ClaimBuster	10309	We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.	0
ClaimBuster	10310	And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.	0
ClaimBuster	10311	"I -- well, maybe they say, ""Well, it was a youthful indiscretion."""	0
ClaimBuster	10312	She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip.	1
ClaimBuster	10313	You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.	1
ClaimBuster	10314	What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10315	I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.	0
ClaimBuster	10316	We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.	1
ClaimBuster	10317	Yes, and I'm certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh - bad period of time in American political history.	0
ClaimBuster	10318	So we're making dramatic progress.	0
ClaimBuster	10319	You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.	0
ClaimBuster	10320	Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	10321	That's what this race is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	10322	If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	10323	I think our Cabinet members are key people.	0
ClaimBuster	10324	She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.	0
ClaimBuster	10325	I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	10326	"I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don't want to see ""under God"" come out from our currency."	0
ClaimBuster	10327	If you've got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.	0
ClaimBuster	10328	Incomes went up for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	10329	We need to rebuild our alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	10330	He had bilateral talks with the North Koreans.	1
ClaimBuster	10331	Let's go back in terms of accepting responsibility for your actions.	0
ClaimBuster	10332	It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.	0
ClaimBuster	10333	Don't talk about growth, because even though we need growth, that's not helping.	0
ClaimBuster	10334	Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we don't have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	10335	I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.	1
ClaimBuster	10336	I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10337	It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they're housed better and have a focused mission for our military.	0
ClaimBuster	10338	Because we cut taxes on everybody -- remember, we ran up the child credit by $1,000, we reduced the marriage penalty, we created a 10 percent bracket, everybody who pays taxes got relief -- the recession was one of the shortest in our nation's history.	1
ClaimBuster	10339	And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.	1
ClaimBuster	10340	And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion.	0
ClaimBuster	10341	He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live.	1
ClaimBuster	10342	And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well.	0
ClaimBuster	10343	Or do you just keep lunging in at will?	0
ClaimBuster	10344	We don't want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they've created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years -- but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	10345	As I said the other night, I hope a lot of them lose because they're liberal Democrats --	0
ClaimBuster	10346	In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	10347	Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices.	0
ClaimBuster	10348	He said I want to take it from the rich, raise $150 billion from the rich.	1
ClaimBuster	10349	Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.	0
ClaimBuster	10350	The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient.	1
ClaimBuster	10351	He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	10352	But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record.	0
ClaimBuster	10353	Now whether or not he'll do that again I've heard some of the people say, well, that's the model we ought to use and if he's reelected maybe he will come back and try it again.	0
ClaimBuster	10354	We had family leave in our office, I'm certain.	1
ClaimBuster	10355	Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.	1
ClaimBuster	10356	You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.	1
ClaimBuster	10357	And let me explain why.	0
ClaimBuster	10358	So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access.	0
ClaimBuster	10359	I had something very nice to say in there.	0
ClaimBuster	10360	Let me see where to start here.	0
ClaimBuster	10361	I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis.	0
ClaimBuster	10362	Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	10363	Houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	10364	Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated.	0
ClaimBuster	10365	Well, that vote wasn't exactly -- a lot of the supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded.	1
ClaimBuster	10366	And I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election.	0
ClaimBuster	10367	We need to cut the business tax rate in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10368	Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	10369	Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	10370	Because -- because this is important.	0
ClaimBuster	10371	Of course it's on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	10372	There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority.	1
ClaimBuster	10373	"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great."	1
ClaimBuster	10374	And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì raise interest rates and put our prosperity at risk.	1
ClaimBuster	10375	Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	10376	On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	10377	There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem.	0
ClaimBuster	10378	One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh - New York City is to - is to finance welfare.	1
ClaimBuster	10379	These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.	1
ClaimBuster	10380	And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again.	0
ClaimBuster	10381	And uh - it would be of - of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers' money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.	0
ClaimBuster	10382	We are a government by the people, and when we move, it should be for very severe and extreme reasons that serve our national interests and end up with a stronger country behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	10383	We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	10384	But we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.	0
ClaimBuster	10385	I wouldn't have supported either.	0
ClaimBuster	10386	Syria -- Syria's not just a tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic -- strategically significant player for America.	1
ClaimBuster	10387	We've come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country.	1
ClaimBuster	10388	We don't have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work.	1
ClaimBuster	10389	I wouldn't relish doing it but I wouldn't shrink from it.	0
ClaimBuster	10390	I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.	1
ClaimBuster	10391	Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision.	1
ClaimBuster	10392	Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.	0
ClaimBuster	10393	Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor's life with a gun will understand that that's not the way America is meant to be.	0
ClaimBuster	10394	See, I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	10395	I'm for an investment tax allowance; I'm for a tax break for first- time homebuyers.	0
ClaimBuster	10396	I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.	0
ClaimBuster	10397	I mean, women know what's it like to be paid an unequal amount for equal work.	0
ClaimBuster	10398	And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.	0
ClaimBuster	10399	He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	10400	I'd be honored and humbled.	0
ClaimBuster	10401	Well, I have to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	10402	And I know the president will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	10403	I thought the Oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in Oregon were trying to do something.	0
ClaimBuster	10404	The second, you've got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries--have another one on that.	0
ClaimBuster	10405	You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose.	1
ClaimBuster	10406	And so, look, I'm going to -- what you need to know about me is I will uphold the law, I'm going to have an attorney general that enforces the law.	0
ClaimBuster	10407	We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others.	1
ClaimBuster	10408	I don't think it's possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did.	0
ClaimBuster	10409	A President must know the essential facts essential to command.	0
ClaimBuster	10410	There is going to be hundreds of experiments off the 22 lines that now exist that are active, and hopefully we find a cure.	1
ClaimBuster	10411	That's called business, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	10412	They're not going to be solved overnight.	0
ClaimBuster	10413	He's been in the United States Senate for 20 years and he hasn't addressed it.	1
ClaimBuster	10414	I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	10415	A little experience, a little age, a little intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	10416	We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.	0
ClaimBuster	10417	Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	10418	Is the behavior you're using prone to cause AIDS?	0
ClaimBuster	10419	26 days from today you and millions of Americans will choose two people to lead us into the future as president and vice president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	10420	It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.	0
ClaimBuster	10421	People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.	1
ClaimBuster	10422	And when you look at what you are proposing...	0
ClaimBuster	10423	Bob, let me just respond.	0
ClaimBuster	10424	Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy's last answer.	0
ClaimBuster	10425	In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, we've got to get it right in the education system, and we're beginning to close a minority achievement gap now.	0
ClaimBuster	10426	It's not going to happen on its own.	0
ClaimBuster	10427	We're going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we ask you to post the results on the Internet.	0
ClaimBuster	10428	If you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund, that means the trust fund goes bankrupt in this generation within 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	10429	We have considered inflation in our figures.	1
ClaimBuster	10430	The measurement is not: Are we safer?	0
ClaimBuster	10431	I'm going to let him keep his wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	10432	And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.	1
ClaimBuster	10433	Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	10434	"I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, ""I've been out of work since May."	1
ClaimBuster	10435	Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬§	1
ClaimBuster	10436	I strongly support local control, so does Governor Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	10437	But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring.	0
ClaimBuster	10438	In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.	0
ClaimBuster	10439	Am I wrong about that?	0
ClaimBuster	10440	I'm really excited about getting it done, too.	0
ClaimBuster	10441	And the way we're going to get it done is we're going to have a brand new Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	10442	We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology.	0
ClaimBuster	10443	When the original treaty was signed back in the early 1900s, when Theodore Roosevelt was president, Panama retained sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone.	1
ClaimBuster	10444	... to -- to -- to...	0
ClaimBuster	10445	That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	10446	Again and again and again, the mother disappears in 3 days, and the child becomes a ward of the state because he's permanently and genetically damaged.	0
ClaimBuster	10447	We'll deny sanctuary to these terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	10448	One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they don't come north, come north despite all the risks.	0
ClaimBuster	10449	He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours.	1
ClaimBuster	10450	And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service.	1
ClaimBuster	10451	There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	10452	I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	10453	And I've never seen a presidential campaign where the presidential nominee runs against my vice presidential nominee; never seen one before.	0
ClaimBuster	10454	I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.	0
ClaimBuster	10455	Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point.	0
ClaimBuster	10456	I'm using the same words that your advisers use.	0
ClaimBuster	10457	But, you know, it's gotten to be about $122 difference.	1
ClaimBuster	10458	There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home.	1
ClaimBuster	10459	Now, just because we don't want to get involved everywhere doesn't mean we should back off anywhere it comes up.	0
ClaimBuster	10460	Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically.	0
ClaimBuster	10461	Because the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people.	1
ClaimBuster	10462	You talk about the Brady Bill.	0
ClaimBuster	10463	And I -- I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.	1
ClaimBuster	10464	There's only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base -- see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact.	0
ClaimBuster	10465	Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives.	0
ClaimBuster	10466	Because that's the way we elect a president in this country, and it's the way we should.	0
ClaimBuster	10467	Because I understand the stakes of this war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	10468	They look at the fact that we owe 'em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that.	1
ClaimBuster	10469	I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training.	1
ClaimBuster	10470	He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	10471	Let me give you the example of Mexico.	0
ClaimBuster	10472	Small businesses are not going to have a mandate.	0
ClaimBuster	10473	So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	10474	Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and - and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court.	0
ClaimBuster	10475	In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.	1
ClaimBuster	10476	That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	10477	And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to.	1
ClaimBuster	10478	And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we've put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever.	1
ClaimBuster	10479	I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families.	0
ClaimBuster	10480	I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion.	1
ClaimBuster	10481	I want to keep this economic recovery going.	0
ClaimBuster	10482	We're going to be able to.	0
ClaimBuster	10483	So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	10484	Now, I can only say this.	0
ClaimBuster	10485	Quotas are bad for America.	0
ClaimBuster	10486	How much for my family?	0
ClaimBuster	10487	But I've got confidence in my country.	0
ClaimBuster	10488	I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	10489	And I think there has to be -- I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth.	0
ClaimBuster	10490	Now that isn't the test of whether America moves.	0
ClaimBuster	10491	I will not agree to another debate.	0
ClaimBuster	10492	I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh - we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice.	0
ClaimBuster	10493	And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	10494	"The Communists say, ""Come with us; look what we've done."""	1
ClaimBuster	10495	And this is your plan, John.	0
ClaimBuster	10496	And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket.	1
ClaimBuster	10497	And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's -- some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for pursuing that.	0
ClaimBuster	10498	It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick.	0
ClaimBuster	10499	He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program.	1
ClaimBuster	10500	I think there're several reasons.	0
ClaimBuster	10501	But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	10502	For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job.	1
ClaimBuster	10503	We still have them on, on some things.	1
ClaimBuster	10504	But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	10505	Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment.	1
ClaimBuster	10506	We provide for managed competition, not government models, in every states.	0
ClaimBuster	10507	We -- we make decisions today in the military that -- that will confront challenges we can't imagine.	0
ClaimBuster	10508	We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.	0
ClaimBuster	10509	Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.	1
ClaimBuster	10510	About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	10511	Benefits were not affected at all.	1
ClaimBuster	10512	And uh - the Playboy thing has been of great - very great concern to me.	0
ClaimBuster	10513	We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet.	1
ClaimBuster	10514	We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	10515	I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.	0
ClaimBuster	10516	Well, we, the living Americans, have gone through four wars.	1
ClaimBuster	10517	We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.	1
ClaimBuster	10518	Let me tell you a little what it's like to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	10519	Well, here we go again.	0
ClaimBuster	10520	And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.	1
ClaimBuster	10521	I have a little foundation for the disabled called the Dole Foundation.	1
ClaimBuster	10522	In Longview, Texas the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer.	1
ClaimBuster	10523	He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	10524	And you can't convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency.	0
ClaimBuster	10525	Now, you don't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	10526	What happens in those forests, because of lousy federal policy, is they grow to be -- they are not -- they're not harvested.	1
ClaimBuster	10527	It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	10528	I didn't hear any plan to fix Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	10529	I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.	1
ClaimBuster	10530	Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world?	0
ClaimBuster	10531	But suppose we came up with that?	0
ClaimBuster	10532	Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped.	0
ClaimBuster	10533	But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	10534	I'm sure there are hundreds of others.	0
ClaimBuster	10535	But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.	0
ClaimBuster	10536	We're talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people.	1
ClaimBuster	10537	Boy, great question and important question, because you're absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	10538	You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	10539	Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest.	0
ClaimBuster	10540	And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that's what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	10541	But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	10542	Now, either he's going to break all these wonderful promises he's told you about or he's going to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	10543	And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.	1
ClaimBuster	10544	"It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, ""Jerry Ford, you've done a good job, keep on doing it."""	0
ClaimBuster	10545	But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.	0
ClaimBuster	10546	Kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	10547	First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.	1
ClaimBuster	10548	I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.	0
ClaimBuster	10549	Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.	1
ClaimBuster	10550	But I'll tell you something, I'm proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	10551	You've been all over the country repeating something that, I will admit, the press has also been repeating -- that I believed that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back.	1
ClaimBuster	10552	A shameless plug there, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	10553	I did to because I too hope that we'll discover cures from the stem cells and from the research derived.	0
ClaimBuster	10554	When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.	1
ClaimBuster	10555	But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American.	0
ClaimBuster	10556	Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬•Mr.	0
ClaimBuster	10557	Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.	0
ClaimBuster	10558	What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?	0
ClaimBuster	10559	And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	10560	I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it.	0
ClaimBuster	10561	I think you know better.	0
ClaimBuster	10562	Where did you find this?	0
ClaimBuster	10563	Why should they be rifling through your files?	0
ClaimBuster	10564	The trial lawyers, big supporters of the president.	1
ClaimBuster	10565	But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.	0
ClaimBuster	10566	I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him.	0
ClaimBuster	10567	I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.	0
ClaimBuster	10568	Millions and millions of people at work.	1
ClaimBuster	10569	A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so -- but, you know, this is a very important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	10570	Let's have community health centers.	0
ClaimBuster	10571	So the net tax increase in his plan's somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	10572	Maybe we can work it out.	0
ClaimBuster	10573	I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off.	0
ClaimBuster	10574	You should have changed the law.	0
ClaimBuster	10575	It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.	1
ClaimBuster	10576	In addition to that, the money that I raise from upper-income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in America that American corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper-income people.	0
ClaimBuster	10577	Let me help the governor.	0
ClaimBuster	10578	public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews.	1
ClaimBuster	10579	"Windows smashed out, painted on one of them ""Unkept promises;"" on another, ""Despair."""	1
ClaimBuster	10580	To get the interest rates down.	0
ClaimBuster	10581	Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.	1
ClaimBuster	10582	Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered.	0
ClaimBuster	10583	That's-at least that's what I read.	0
ClaimBuster	10584	If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	10585	We wish you a lot of luck.	0
ClaimBuster	10586	They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.	1
ClaimBuster	10587	It's a nation that's not like -- like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.	1
ClaimBuster	10588	You know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself.	0
ClaimBuster	10589	That's a test of prestige.	0
ClaimBuster	10590	I'd say, several hundred of them.	1
ClaimBuster	10591	In 1957 I was in Havana.	1
ClaimBuster	10592	Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	10593	And I believe that's very, very important.	0
ClaimBuster	10594	One party is ready to move in these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	10595	As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy.	0
ClaimBuster	10596	I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker.	0
ClaimBuster	10597	I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform.	0
ClaimBuster	10598	China had a space launch and a space walk.	1
ClaimBuster	10599	President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term, but he didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	10600	All right, I'm not going to cut education funding.	0
ClaimBuster	10601	Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues.	1
ClaimBuster	10602	And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.	0
ClaimBuster	10603	But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.	0
ClaimBuster	10604	And -- and they're throughout many nations in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	10605	It has - uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately.	1
ClaimBuster	10606	Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	10607	So I want to keep the quality of health care.	0
ClaimBuster	10608	It's kind of one of those exaggerations.	0
ClaimBuster	10609	You said that they could get it in the private marketplace.	1
ClaimBuster	10610	But let's get back to the core issue here.	0
ClaimBuster	10611	We got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert a hostile world to a peaceful world.	0
ClaimBuster	10612	And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.	1
ClaimBuster	10613	We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government.	1
ClaimBuster	10614	As a matter of fact, we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	10615	But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.	0
ClaimBuster	10616	I talk to Tony Blair all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	10617	You've got some pretty strong-willed guys up there that argue with you.	0
ClaimBuster	10618	And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.	1
ClaimBuster	10619	Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	10620	He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he'll be a strong Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	10621	In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery.	0
ClaimBuster	10622	The fact that you have an agreement is one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10623	At least we have low interest rates that the Fed can control.	0
ClaimBuster	10624	Republicans have cut 53 billion dollars in spending, that's why the budget looked good.	1
ClaimBuster	10625	It's the sunrise side, not the sunset side.	0
ClaimBuster	10626	I know it's not popular, and I understand the nature of your question.	0
ClaimBuster	10627	It hasn't been undone since I was there.	1
ClaimBuster	10628	But I think there are personal differences.	0
ClaimBuster	10629	I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.	0
ClaimBuster	10630	I do not add a penny to the national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	10631	I'd like to just respond, if I might.	0
ClaimBuster	10632	He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that.	1
ClaimBuster	10633	So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.	0
ClaimBuster	10634	And this was a -- this was a program of the government.	1
ClaimBuster	10635	Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America.	0
ClaimBuster	10636	We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.	1
ClaimBuster	10637	I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10638	I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there.	1
ClaimBuster	10639	That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.	1
ClaimBuster	10640	My concerns about the senator is that, in the course of this campaign, I've been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changes positions on the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	10641	You said you'd cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	10642	The question was about the Supreme Court.	1
ClaimBuster	10643	They're not going to follow somebody who says this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time.	0
ClaimBuster	10644	In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures.	0
ClaimBuster	10645	And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can't compete.	1
ClaimBuster	10646	That the best is over.	0
ClaimBuster	10647	Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations.	1
ClaimBuster	10648	And he said at that time, in a quote, and this is a paraphrase, a freeze, that's easy.	1
ClaimBuster	10649	Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?	0
ClaimBuster	10650	You're going to have plans...	0
ClaimBuster	10651	We've got potentially 600,000 jobs and 100 years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas.	1
ClaimBuster	10652	That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.	1
ClaimBuster	10653	We've got to be tough on international terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	10654	They didn't do the planning.	0
ClaimBuster	10655	Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?	0
ClaimBuster	10656	A lot of great single moms, single dads.	0
ClaimBuster	10657	We've also got to look to the future.	0
ClaimBuster	10658	That doesn't cost any more money.	0
ClaimBuster	10659	And I have devoted a major portion of this campaign to going across this country and looking for opportunities to go to white groups and African American groups and Latino groups and Asian American groups and say the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10660	The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956.	1
ClaimBuster	10661	That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh - we all know that it would've controlled our economy, it would've added uh - ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government.	1
ClaimBuster	10662	Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems.	0
ClaimBuster	10663	We'll even give it to you.	0
ClaimBuster	10664	I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened, when our treaty commitments are at stake, when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest, and that is a part of being president.	0
ClaimBuster	10665	Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	10666	I believe there are certain principles we must find in dealing with him and his colleagues - principles, if followed, that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	10667	Every place I go I talk about it, and I think they want it done.	0
ClaimBuster	10668	That little child needs to be loved and hugged and nurtured and made to feel special, like your children were.	0
ClaimBuster	10669	And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.	0
ClaimBuster	10670	This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors can pull our troops or diplomats up for trial.	1
ClaimBuster	10671	We've got to sit down together across the table.	0
ClaimBuster	10672	I worry about federalizing education if I were you.	0
ClaimBuster	10673	I felt that -- I wish we'd have had a better vision of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	10674	And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	10675	But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	10676	I remember one day on the floor I said now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, why haven't we thought of that before.	1
ClaimBuster	10677	I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.	1
ClaimBuster	10678	Well, I think it's terrible.	0
ClaimBuster	10679	They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.	1
ClaimBuster	10680	Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	10681	A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.	0
ClaimBuster	10682	I can't tell you how lucky I am.	0
ClaimBuster	10683	He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.	1
ClaimBuster	10684	We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.	0
ClaimBuster	10685	In other words, there are practical things we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	10686	Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10687	We've spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that we're on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, it's going to go well over $1 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	10688	We've got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher.	0
ClaimBuster	10689	Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it.	0
ClaimBuster	10690	The people want economic reform.	0
ClaimBuster	10691	If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	10692	Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools.	0
ClaimBuster	10693	One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.	0
ClaimBuster	10694	Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature.	0
ClaimBuster	10695	And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight our way back.	0
ClaimBuster	10696	Our allies - the smaller countries get trampled in the rush.	0
ClaimBuster	10697	It's not to increase the scope of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	10698	I think it is respecting life to do it in an ethical way.	0
ClaimBuster	10699	Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	10700	That's going to change when I'm president, but we can't change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	10701	One percent of America, the highest one percent of income earners in America, got $89 billion of tax cut last year.	1
ClaimBuster	10702	But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard.	0
ClaimBuster	10703	We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.	1
ClaimBuster	10704	That's why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates and weaken the economy and that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy.	1
ClaimBuster	10705	And our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and it's a great threat.	1
ClaimBuster	10706	And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	10707	We are all in this together.	0
ClaimBuster	10708	But when we look at the growth of G.N.P.	0
ClaimBuster	10709	She's been doing this for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	10710	I think I'm a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated four years ago against President Ford.	0
ClaimBuster	10711	And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.	0
ClaimBuster	10712	This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	10713	See, the subjective thing is when does President Bush react?	0
ClaimBuster	10714	We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	10715	And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	10716	They want to get into our market.	1
ClaimBuster	10717	I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I don't think we need to touch Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	10718	I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere.	0
ClaimBuster	10719	The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.	0
ClaimBuster	10720	I wanted us to pay for it, since we're at war.	0
ClaimBuster	10721	If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	10722	We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...	0
ClaimBuster	10723	It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	10724	I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.	0
ClaimBuster	10725	Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up.	1
ClaimBuster	10726	No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.	0
ClaimBuster	10727	And I think we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	10728	I went to New York.	1
ClaimBuster	10729	And yet even though Ambassador Smith and Ambassador Gardner, both Republican Ambassadors, both warned of Castro, the Marxist influences around Castro, the Communist influences around Castro, both of them have testified in the last six weeks, that in spite of their warnings to the American government, nothing was done.	1
ClaimBuster	10730	But I want to get our private sector growing and I know how to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	10731	Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	10732	And the plans that I talked about will create even more.	0
ClaimBuster	10733	My record on world affairs is pretty well known because I've been president for 4 years, so I feel I've been talking issues.	1
ClaimBuster	10734	And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term.	0
ClaimBuster	10735	And it is important that we don't provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests.	0
ClaimBuster	10736	There's no doubt, I think, about that.	0
ClaimBuster	10737	We get nothing for it.	0
ClaimBuster	10738	It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	10739	They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.	1
ClaimBuster	10740	I don't believe the present administration has done that.	0
ClaimBuster	10741	They're looking to us for leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	10742	Secondly, I think one thing that if I were sent to do the job, I would sit down with FDA, look at exactly where we are.	0
ClaimBuster	10743	But I also know how to lead those alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	10744	Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	10745	The fact is that we now have people from the Middle East, allegedly, coming across the border.	1
ClaimBuster	10746	But I salute him for his passion.	0
ClaimBuster	10747	I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	10748	But at least it took that burden away from them.	0
ClaimBuster	10749	I think we're going to have to do better.	0
ClaimBuster	10750	And so I don't support censorship.	0
ClaimBuster	10751	We have made remarkable success.	0
ClaimBuster	10752	A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasn't through any fault of their own, but they were defeated.	1
ClaimBuster	10753	Well, as a matter of fact there is.	0
ClaimBuster	10754	This is a government that thinks a 2% rate of return on your money is satisfactory.	0
ClaimBuster	10755	So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon.	1
ClaimBuster	10756	He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years.	1
ClaimBuster	10757	We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	10758	I support it; the president opposes it.	0
ClaimBuster	10759	What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.	0
ClaimBuster	10760	I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation.	0
ClaimBuster	10761	Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate.	0
ClaimBuster	10762	And right now, Osama bin Laden might be in jail or dead.	0
ClaimBuster	10763	Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching.	0
ClaimBuster	10764	Just going to make a point.	0
ClaimBuster	10765	The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.	1
ClaimBuster	10766	That's my difference with the President.	0
ClaimBuster	10767	Now, private schools play a great role in our society.	0
ClaimBuster	10768	I think Mr. Perot has confronted this deficit issue, but I think it's important to point out that we really have 2 deficits in America, not one.	1
ClaimBuster	10769	He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason: He wanted to restart his weapons programs.	1
ClaimBuster	10770	We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.	0
ClaimBuster	10771	A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.	0
ClaimBuster	10772	I will pick judges who will interpret the Constitution, but I'll have no litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	10773	I'll remind mothers and dads the best weapon is the off/on button, and paying attention to your children, and eating dinner with them and being -- I'm sorry.	0
ClaimBuster	10774	Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions.	0
ClaimBuster	10775	And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?	0
ClaimBuster	10776	What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.	0
ClaimBuster	10777	And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.	1
ClaimBuster	10778	The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind.	0
ClaimBuster	10779	This current campaign financing system has not reflected credit on anybody in either party.	1
ClaimBuster	10780	They would not be in the budget, but you want one now?	0
ClaimBuster	10781	And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.	0
ClaimBuster	10782	I visited some of those kids with no limbs today, because they didn't have the armor on those vehicles.	1
ClaimBuster	10783	You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	10784	I made a mistake in the way I talk about it.	1
ClaimBuster	10785	Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.	1
ClaimBuster	10786	I think we should stiffen the embargo on the Belgrade government, and I think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the Bosnians, since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing.	1
ClaimBuster	10787	Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot.	1
ClaimBuster	10788	The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people.	1
ClaimBuster	10789	So it's not that we always disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	10790	That shows a lack of understanding.	0
ClaimBuster	10791	Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management.	0
ClaimBuster	10792	And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless, economic policies that won't create jobs, won't reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don't have to play by the same rules that you do.	0
ClaimBuster	10793	Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.	0
ClaimBuster	10794	Taxes are going up when you run up the top two brackets.	1
ClaimBuster	10795	Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.	0
ClaimBuster	10796	Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	10797	And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.	1
ClaimBuster	10798	And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.	1
ClaimBuster	10799	It's in this way, by making wise choices, that we're stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control.	0
ClaimBuster	10800	It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.	0
ClaimBuster	10801	I don't want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers.	0
ClaimBuster	10802	That in itself is a big difference.	0
ClaimBuster	10803	But I'm not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America.	0
ClaimBuster	10804	And the -- the challenge we have -- I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy -- but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	10805	"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership."""	1
ClaimBuster	10806	And we have a responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	10807	Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.	1
ClaimBuster	10808	He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform.	1
ClaimBuster	10809	I would like to tell you a quick story.	0
ClaimBuster	10810	And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.	0
ClaimBuster	10811	And I read in the bulletin about teenage pregnancies, about the difficulties that families are having to make ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	10812	I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million-and-a-half on my plan, which means he doesn't want you to know what he's doing is loading up IOUs for future generations.	1
ClaimBuster	10813	And there are a long list of thing.	0
ClaimBuster	10814	And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.	1
ClaimBuster	10815	And we're going to keep on doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	10816	The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers.	1
ClaimBuster	10817	There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	10818	And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour; then it's leveled again, but in the meantime you've wrecked the country with these kind of deals.	1
ClaimBuster	10819	I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we're glad to have a comparison with the previous administration.	0
ClaimBuster	10820	We had navy vessels that couldn't leave harbor because of lack of crew or, again, lack of spare parts.	1
ClaimBuster	10821	I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too.	1
ClaimBuster	10822	It's invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd to none and revitalize the private economy.	0
ClaimBuster	10823	I'm also against the pipeline embargo, which you folks attempted to impose.	1
ClaimBuster	10824	There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live.	0
ClaimBuster	10825	I served for eight years in the House of Representatives and I served on the Intelligence Committee, specialized in looking at arms control.	1
ClaimBuster	10826	That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	10827	Let's just make that very clear.	0
ClaimBuster	10828	We haven't adequately funded veterans' care.	1
ClaimBuster	10829	Uhh - and I think uh - we've tightened it up; we've uh - straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years.	0
ClaimBuster	10830	Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again.	0
ClaimBuster	10831	And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.	0
ClaimBuster	10832	I think that's an important part of leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	10833	Certainly we care about the people, we care about the children, we care about the tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	10834	Remember, he's the person who's accusing me of not acting multilaterally.	1
ClaimBuster	10835	But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10836	I don't have time in 30 seconds to respond to fix all that.	0
ClaimBuster	10837	Bringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive.	1
ClaimBuster	10838	We tried this with Hitler.	1
ClaimBuster	10839	It immediately was put to use.	1
ClaimBuster	10840	My own background is different from his.	1
ClaimBuster	10841	And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions.	1
ClaimBuster	10842	Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	10843	I want to finally get something done on Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	10844	But the price of coal is down worldwide.	1
ClaimBuster	10845	I'm in public service because I love this country.	1
ClaimBuster	10846	I served as a pastor in my congregation for about 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	10847	What we do need to do, though, is control the growth of these mandatory programs.	0
ClaimBuster	10848	I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency.	0
ClaimBuster	10849	That's not the way we're going to create jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	10850	We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations.	0
ClaimBuster	10851	Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living.	1
ClaimBuster	10852	I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.	0
ClaimBuster	10853	She's going to get rid of nobody.	0
ClaimBuster	10854	Why can't they do it quietly?	0
ClaimBuster	10855	Now, the Vice President will probably tell you that it's going to take an army of IRS collectors again.	0
ClaimBuster	10856	I am proud of what we did at the Democratic Convention, putting 2 HIV-positive people on the platform, and I am proud of the leadership that I'm going to bring to this country in dealing with the AIDS crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	10857	And what we've said is let's change those certifications.	0
ClaimBuster	10858	I don't think there are any villains, but, boy, is the system rotten.	0
ClaimBuster	10859	And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980.	0
ClaimBuster	10860	"I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated -- this was in Philadelphia -- and she said, ""I've got my degree."	1
ClaimBuster	10861	But frankly, I don't think that's the problem today.	0
ClaimBuster	10862	She should not be allowed to run.	0
ClaimBuster	10863	And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who's shown the ability to get things done?	0
ClaimBuster	10864	It's the largest increase in federal government health care ever.	1
ClaimBuster	10865	My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker's wife.	1
ClaimBuster	10866	We see in -- in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against -- against our people there, four people dead.	1
ClaimBuster	10867	I'm simply not going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	10868	What I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10869	But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left.	0
ClaimBuster	10870	Your premiums are going up.	1
ClaimBuster	10871	He had to be subpoenaed.	0
ClaimBuster	10872	My opponent says we didn't have any allies in this war.	1
ClaimBuster	10873	And that's how best it is to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	10874	I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	10875	He chose a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans over getting that equipment out into the homeland as fast as possible.	1
ClaimBuster	10876	So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times.	1
ClaimBuster	10877	Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for moderating.	0
ClaimBuster	10878	Marijuana use is up 141percent.	1
ClaimBuster	10879	We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	10880	My opponent was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	10881	I am -- I have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000.	0
ClaimBuster	10882	So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term.	0
ClaimBuster	10883	They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices.	1
ClaimBuster	10884	And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.	1
ClaimBuster	10885	We've seen uh - in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there.	1
ClaimBuster	10886	We paid down the debt for two years.	1
ClaimBuster	10887	But I'm concerned that that will get overturned.	0
ClaimBuster	10888	We don't have modernization now.	1
ClaimBuster	10889	As I said a couple of months ago, I stand here as my own man and I want you to see me for who I really am.	0
ClaimBuster	10890	Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	1
ClaimBuster	10891	Secondly, I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	10892	We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal.	1
ClaimBuster	10893	Even the administration has admitted they haven't done the training, because they came back to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money.	1
ClaimBuster	10894	I think that some common sense gun safety measures are certainly needed with the flood of cheap handguns that have sometimes been working their way into the hands of the wrong people.	0
ClaimBuster	10895	There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	10896	I'll have an administration that will make you proud.	0
ClaimBuster	10897	It's the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency we've had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS.	1
ClaimBuster	10898	Because I went to Washington to fix problems.	1
ClaimBuster	10899	This isn't the kind of Administration we need.	0
ClaimBuster	10900	I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	10901	And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	1
ClaimBuster	10902	We need all the talent we can get.	0
ClaimBuster	10903	Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology.	0
ClaimBuster	10904	And that means tax cuts for the middle-class.	0
ClaimBuster	10905	In our first debate he proposed America pass a global test.	1
ClaimBuster	10906	Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	10907	And the president just walks on by this problem.	0
ClaimBuster	10908	I want our legal system to work better.	0
ClaimBuster	10909	That's why I think it's important.	0
ClaimBuster	10910	What you're interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you?	0
ClaimBuster	10911	I also thought the wealthiest people in America ought to pay for it, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	10912	In addition, uh - the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others.	1
ClaimBuster	10913	And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.	0
ClaimBuster	10914	It's stuck in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	10915	Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war.	0
ClaimBuster	10916	But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	10917	Let me just mention three things very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	10918	The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word, that we stand with you, that we believe you want to be free.	0
ClaimBuster	10919	I was a school board member, and a library board member.	1
ClaimBuster	10920	Actually, in constant dollars, in the domestic side of the budget, there has been no spending increase in the 4 years that we have been here.	1
ClaimBuster	10921	One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.	0
ClaimBuster	10922	And so now we've got to take some decisive action.	0
ClaimBuster	10923	You're not going to worry about it anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	10924	The fact is, we haven't done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will.	0
ClaimBuster	10925	We'll start working on Day 1 in the Dole- Kemp administration.	0
ClaimBuster	10926	The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.	1
ClaimBuster	10927	The president said he would.	1
ClaimBuster	10928	I'm asking you to see me for who I really am.	0
ClaimBuster	10929	And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	10930	So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	10931	And that's why people are so concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	10932	And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has Al Qaida, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.	0
ClaimBuster	10933	I believe we're overextended in too many places.	0
ClaimBuster	10934	We had an $800 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	10935	You've got people doing two and three rotations.	1
ClaimBuster	10936	Number four, we do have to develop their economic -- their economic capabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	10937	I really don't think your rights are being watered down.	0
ClaimBuster	10938	So I don't think we can judge on, the stock market has been strong.	0
ClaimBuster	10939	And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.	0
ClaimBuster	10940	When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February.	1
ClaimBuster	10941	I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.	0
ClaimBuster	10942	Now, what do we do about it?	0
ClaimBuster	10943	But because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember -- freeze it, back in the late 70s -- freeze, don't touch it; we're going to lock it in now or else we'll have war.	0
ClaimBuster	10944	I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my child's school isn't doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education.	0
ClaimBuster	10945	It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.	0
ClaimBuster	10946	It finally gets to 50 cents at the end of the 5th year.	1
ClaimBuster	10947	The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	10948	And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	10949	And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building.	0
ClaimBuster	10950	I'm looking at our economic plan because I'm concerned about the future for young people.	0
ClaimBuster	10951	But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.	0
ClaimBuster	10952	The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.	0
ClaimBuster	10953	And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.	1
ClaimBuster	10954	I offer a new approach.	0
ClaimBuster	10955	Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	10956	Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded.	1
ClaimBuster	10957	You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.	0
ClaimBuster	10958	They're going to expand their companies.	0
ClaimBuster	10959	I've said it's going to take some work.	1
ClaimBuster	10960	I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president's term and even further back than that, that we'd have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn't explode in the way that it did.	0
ClaimBuster	10961	Next Tuesday all of you will go to the polls, will stand there in the polling place and make a decision.	0
ClaimBuster	10962	But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	10963	But it's good that we have them.	0
ClaimBuster	10964	But he wants to raise taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	10965	But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that don't change - those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	10966	It's very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows.	0
ClaimBuster	10967	Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion.	1
ClaimBuster	10968	The Vice President talks about national security.	1
ClaimBuster	10969	Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?	1
ClaimBuster	10970	I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can't come into our ports.	0
ClaimBuster	10971	And secondly, only a liberal senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough.	1
ClaimBuster	10972	This president just -- I don't know if he sees what's really happened over there.	0
ClaimBuster	10973	And actually, you said it back in 2010.	1
ClaimBuster	10974	What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	10975	Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.	1
ClaimBuster	10976	But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	10977	It is America that's in the lead in helping with humanitarian relief for Somalia.	1
ClaimBuster	10978	Well, let me say, first of all, I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission.	0
ClaimBuster	10979	Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.	1
ClaimBuster	10980	I am for clean water.	0
ClaimBuster	10981	When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.	1
ClaimBuster	10982	Let -- let -- let me say that we obviously would not wait for the United Nations Security Council.	0
ClaimBuster	10983	George Bush, who I think is one of the finest Vice Presidents this country has ever had -- George Bush and I have crisscrossed the country, and we've had, in these last few months, a wonderful experience.	1
ClaimBuster	10984	But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support.	0
ClaimBuster	10985	He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.	0
ClaimBuster	10986	And I have proposed that.	1
ClaimBuster	10987	I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures - a one-for-one proposition.	1
ClaimBuster	10988	That is what I want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	10989	But if we sit around blowing all this energy out the window on racial strife and hatred, we are stuck with a sure loser because we have been a melting pot.	0
ClaimBuster	10990	When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.	1
ClaimBuster	10991	If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.	0
ClaimBuster	10992	Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	10993	That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.	0
ClaimBuster	10994	President Lincoln opposed the war and there were people who said maybe he shouldn't be president, but I think he made us a pretty good president in wartime.	1
ClaimBuster	10995	I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.	1
ClaimBuster	10996	It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman - the labor subcommittee - in fifty-five.	1
ClaimBuster	10997	For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months.	1
ClaimBuster	10998	There's a lot of young folks saying, you know, why do I want to be involved with this mess?	0
ClaimBuster	10999	I think they noticed that as well.	0
ClaimBuster	11000	So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that.	0
ClaimBuster	11001	Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.	1
ClaimBuster	11002	But let me say this, because he spent millions and millions of dollars of advertising on the subject of Boston Harbor.	1
ClaimBuster	11003	We want to be sure it's fair and equitable.	0
ClaimBuster	11004	No, let me tell you something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	11005	This is a real important election.	0
ClaimBuster	11006	Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations.	1
ClaimBuster	11007	Sarah Palin knows about that better than most.	0
ClaimBuster	11008	I believe when we're strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	11009	We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.	0
ClaimBuster	11010	It takes eight years, ten years, to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	11011	So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.	1
ClaimBuster	11012	We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	11013	Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn't even understand that.	0
ClaimBuster	11014	We've signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program.	1
ClaimBuster	11015	The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	11016	He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	11017	I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes.	0
ClaimBuster	11018	And I can't tell how proud I am of her and her family.	0
ClaimBuster	11019	And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.	1
ClaimBuster	11020	Now, I've told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that.	1
ClaimBuster	11021	When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize.	1
ClaimBuster	11022	That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that.	0
ClaimBuster	11023	So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget.	1
ClaimBuster	11024	I would do the opposite in every respect.	0
ClaimBuster	11025	It's time to have somebody to step up and say look, let's let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets.	0
ClaimBuster	11026	That could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids.	1
ClaimBuster	11027	Virginia's in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms.	1
ClaimBuster	11028	Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?	0
ClaimBuster	11029	But they're now back in helping with elections.	1
ClaimBuster	11030	Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	11031	There's going to be 125,000 trained by the end of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	11032	We've expanded the Brady Bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids.	1
ClaimBuster	11033	It's never quite as simple as the president wants you to believe.	0
ClaimBuster	11034	And you can be part of our America and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us.	0
ClaimBuster	11035	Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that we've had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period.	1
ClaimBuster	11036	You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	11037	And there's going to be an Arab summit, of the neighborhood countries.	1
ClaimBuster	11038	So I complain about that.	0
ClaimBuster	11039	We√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and we√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise we'll be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude.	1
ClaimBuster	11040	Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.	1
ClaimBuster	11041	I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn't hold public office, didn't have very much money.	1
ClaimBuster	11042	If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up.	1
ClaimBuster	11043	But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	11044	When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	11045	They talk about family income being up.	0
ClaimBuster	11046	Well, Mr. Carter has uh indicated that uh - he would give a blanket pardon to all uh - draft evaders.	1
ClaimBuster	11047	And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.	1
ClaimBuster	11048	No other state programs do that.	1
ClaimBuster	11049	And we have to keep our military strong.	0
ClaimBuster	11050	I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	11051	I'm offering you my own vision, my own experience, my own proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	11052	Invest in American jobs, American education, control health care costs, bring this country together again.	0
ClaimBuster	11053	I have a plan to provide for our schools so we keep the standards but we help our teachers teach and elevate our schools by funding No Child Left Behind.	0
ClaimBuster	11054	And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.	0
ClaimBuster	11055	He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	11056	And sometimes those projects, not -- not the overhead projector that Senator Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have -- will have to be eliminated, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	11057	I don't want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I've never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration - Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	11058	Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.	1
ClaimBuster	11059	And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.	0
ClaimBuster	11060	And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.	1
ClaimBuster	11061	The intelligence I looked at was the same intelligence my opponent looked at, the very same intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	11062	"We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television"" in your famous discussion in the kitchen."	1
ClaimBuster	11063	Those children will all go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	11064	Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.	1
ClaimBuster	11065	We've lost credibility around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11066	Today it will take 12 generations.	0
ClaimBuster	11067	We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.	1
ClaimBuster	11068	I saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yassir Arafat signed on the West Bank.	1
ClaimBuster	11069	Sometimes we've been embarrassed and sometimes we've been ashamed.	0
ClaimBuster	11070	Nobody called for the invasion of Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	11071	Yes, we want change but we are the change.	0
ClaimBuster	11072	Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.	0
ClaimBuster	11073	And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that.	0
ClaimBuster	11074	Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them.	0
ClaimBuster	11075	Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.	0
ClaimBuster	11076	"I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a ""K,"" a ""G,"" and a ""B."""	0
ClaimBuster	11077	Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover.	0
ClaimBuster	11078	The next four years we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses.	0
ClaimBuster	11079	we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.	1
ClaimBuster	11080	In terms of this one on taxes spells out the biggest difference between us.	0
ClaimBuster	11081	We have not been firm and strong.	0
ClaimBuster	11082	-- because we were worried to death that Gaddafi might be building up chemical weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	11083	You've shared your stories with me.	1
ClaimBuster	11084	But I have no loans with Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	11085	Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	11086	I also want to make sure that we get this economy going.	0
ClaimBuster	11087	I propose a detailed budget, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	11088	Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.	1
ClaimBuster	11089	It certainly wasn't the attitude that took place out west, however.	0
ClaimBuster	11090	And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	11091	Now, my fellow Americans, that's an invitation to disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	11092	We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.	1
ClaimBuster	11093	If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed.	0
ClaimBuster	11094	It's been my great honor to serve it for many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	11095	And in the meantime, we have to be strong enough to make certain that the Soviet Union never tempts us.	0
ClaimBuster	11096	I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns.	0
ClaimBuster	11097	Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college.	0
ClaimBuster	11098	You don't send troops to war without the body armor that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	11099	I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.	0
ClaimBuster	11100	That's quite different than some.	0
ClaimBuster	11101	And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.	1
ClaimBuster	11102	But I would cite that as a major accomplishment.	0
ClaimBuster	11103	Now that means the best leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	11104	It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential.	0
ClaimBuster	11105	It's a tax that taxes people twice.	1
ClaimBuster	11106	I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.	0
ClaimBuster	11107	Now that will change America.	0
ClaimBuster	11108	Equality of opportunity in the field of housing, which could be done on all federal supported housing by a stroke of the president's pen.	1
ClaimBuster	11109	We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	11110	Mr. Nixon talks about our being the strongest country in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11111	And we know that there were further diplomatic efforts under way.	0
ClaimBuster	11112	And certainly, I'm not proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	11113	So we have two that I'd put as number one.	0
ClaimBuster	11114	The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council.	1
ClaimBuster	11115	It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer.	1
ClaimBuster	11116	And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us.	0
ClaimBuster	11117	The president's put it in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.	1
ClaimBuster	11118	The last thing I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country, in Washington with more police on the street, in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in Southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.	1
ClaimBuster	11119	We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies.	0
ClaimBuster	11120	Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.	0
ClaimBuster	11121	We have bridges and tunnels that aren't being secured, chemical plants, nuclear plants that aren't secured, hospitals that are overcrowded with their emergency rooms.	0
ClaimBuster	11122	But it's very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced.	0
ClaimBuster	11123	I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead.	0
ClaimBuster	11124	There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.	0
ClaimBuster	11125	And I'll take responsibility for them.	0
ClaimBuster	11126	And at that point they'll just be like apples falling out of a tree.	0
ClaimBuster	11127	And he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he took a very unfair pounding.	0
ClaimBuster	11128	We're far away from that now.	0
ClaimBuster	11129	A recent poll was taken among 1,000 enlisted personnel, as well as officers, over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up.	1
ClaimBuster	11130	We've got to stop this greed and excess.	0
ClaimBuster	11131	He's talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states.	0
ClaimBuster	11132	Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	11133	Thank you very, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	11134	We're not going to get rid of all regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	11135	You have to have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	11136	I would say this; that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	11137	But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.	1
ClaimBuster	11138	Medicare, I know you talked about it, but Medicare is relevant for all of us, young and old alike.	1
ClaimBuster	11139	I know what it means to be poor.	0
ClaimBuster	11140	It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	11141	I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	11142	But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.	0
ClaimBuster	11143	That's what I learned in Vietnam.	0
ClaimBuster	11144	That's why I'm a big proponent of clean coal technology, to make sure we can use coal but in a clean way.	0
ClaimBuster	11145	The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect.	1
ClaimBuster	11146	Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	11147	There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money.	0
ClaimBuster	11148	I'm going to find people that want to serve their country.	0
ClaimBuster	11149	We'll make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	11150	And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching.	1
ClaimBuster	11151	Step one, if I get up there, we're going to clean that up.	0
ClaimBuster	11152	I have never supported quotas.	1
ClaimBuster	11153	Well he made the promise.	1
ClaimBuster	11154	And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	11155	We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	11156	And the American people are willing to have fair, shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	11157	Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal I'm making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor.	1
ClaimBuster	11158	And so while it's true that nobody's completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history.	1
ClaimBuster	11159	We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.	1
ClaimBuster	11160	Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.	0
ClaimBuster	11161	I said last week I believed in a balanced budget.	1
ClaimBuster	11162	Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they're paying higher taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	11163	And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	11164	The choices were not good then.	0
ClaimBuster	11165	We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.	0
ClaimBuster	11166	I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and that's the role of goverment to encourage that.	0
ClaimBuster	11167	Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge.	0
ClaimBuster	11168	No president, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	11169	We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.	0
ClaimBuster	11170	And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders.	0
ClaimBuster	11171	Government ought to stand on the side of parents.	0
ClaimBuster	11172	And we've got to attend to them.	0
ClaimBuster	11173	And they buried it till right after the election.	1
ClaimBuster	11174	And when he -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	11175	Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?	0
ClaimBuster	11176	You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11177	Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	11178	If you want somebody who will fight for you and who will fight to have middle-class tax cuts, then I am your man.	0
ClaimBuster	11179	I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.	1
ClaimBuster	11180	The best America is yet to come.	0
ClaimBuster	11181	But I've had my anxious moments in my life.	0
ClaimBuster	11182	And in 2006, our seniors will get a prescription drug coverage in Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	11183	I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.	1
ClaimBuster	11184	All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors.	0
ClaimBuster	11185	I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they don't, they don't stick around very long.	0
ClaimBuster	11186	Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions.	0
ClaimBuster	11187	But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.	1
ClaimBuster	11188	You get more money, you keep more of your taxes by going abroad.	1
ClaimBuster	11189	And we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills.	1
ClaimBuster	11190	But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.	0
ClaimBuster	11191	Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process.	0
ClaimBuster	11192	The grain sales have been a benefit to American agriculture.	0
ClaimBuster	11193	If you take care of an elderly in your home, you're going to get the personal exemption increased.	1
ClaimBuster	11194	And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.	0
ClaimBuster	11195	No, they haven't had talks in two years.	1
ClaimBuster	11196	We feel that uh - in education we can have a slight increase - not a major increase.	0
ClaimBuster	11197	You own your own account.	1
ClaimBuster	11198	It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.	0
ClaimBuster	11199	And this is uh - the point of my first statistics that I gave you - that - that the present tax benefits that have been carved out over a long period of years - fifty years - by sharp tax lawyers and by lobbyists have benefited just the rich.	1
ClaimBuster	11200	In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free.	1
ClaimBuster	11201	They are plotting to kill Americans right now.	1
ClaimBuster	11202	He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not.	1
ClaimBuster	11203	And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal: Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	11204	I supported the President's trade policy.	1
ClaimBuster	11205	We talk about it all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	11206	Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow.	0
ClaimBuster	11207	So here's what I would do.	0
ClaimBuster	11208	Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable.	1
ClaimBuster	11209	"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87."	1
ClaimBuster	11210	But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there.	0
ClaimBuster	11211	South Korea faces a very delicate situation.	0
ClaimBuster	11212	You know, I think about Missy Johnson.	0
ClaimBuster	11213	You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...	0
ClaimBuster	11214	It shouldn't be that way.	0
ClaimBuster	11215	First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members.	1
ClaimBuster	11216	This is for Governor Romney?	0
ClaimBuster	11217	And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	11218	Let me tell you what the facts are.	0
ClaimBuster	11219	If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do.	0
ClaimBuster	11220	Our children will not see the American dream because of this debt that somebody somewhere dropped on us.	0
ClaimBuster	11221	Secondly was the federal aid to education bill.	0
ClaimBuster	11222	And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.	0
ClaimBuster	11223	That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity.	0
ClaimBuster	11224	"You might say, ""Well, you got an example of one that worked better?"""	0
ClaimBuster	11225	Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country.	1
ClaimBuster	11226	I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today.	0
ClaimBuster	11227	But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year.	1
ClaimBuster	11228	Look, we're gonna face some serious new challenges in the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	11229	I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls, seeing their dads out there campaigning.	0
ClaimBuster	11230	The President was opposed to it in 1993.	1
ClaimBuster	11231	It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.	0
ClaimBuster	11232	Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA.	1
ClaimBuster	11233	You call yourself the King of Debt.	0
ClaimBuster	11234	Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	11235	But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books.	1
ClaimBuster	11236	What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer.	1
ClaimBuster	11237	I know how these people think.	0
ClaimBuster	11238	And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.	0
ClaimBuster	11239	Then the question is, can we govern?	0
ClaimBuster	11240	All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled.	1
ClaimBuster	11241	Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.	0
ClaimBuster	11242	Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.	0
ClaimBuster	11243	He just doesn't understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that.	0
ClaimBuster	11244	It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	11245	In the Middle East, we've worked for a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, successfully, and have tied ourselves together with Israel and Egypt in a common defense capability.	1
ClaimBuster	11246	Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities.	0
ClaimBuster	11247	We need to say here's your tax incentive: if you create American jobs, the old-fashioned way.	0
ClaimBuster	11248	And one thing I have to say.	0
ClaimBuster	11249	Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.	1
ClaimBuster	11250	I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.	0
ClaimBuster	11251	Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said we will plan carefully.	1
ClaimBuster	11252	He put $139 billion of windfall profit into the pockets of the drug companies right out of your pockets.	1
ClaimBuster	11253	That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	11254	And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.	1
ClaimBuster	11255	We will select the best man we can get.	0
ClaimBuster	11256	There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500.	1
ClaimBuster	11257	Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.	0
ClaimBuster	11258	I have a plan to protect the environment so that we leave this place in better shape to our children than we were handed it by our parents.	1
ClaimBuster	11259	And uh - the individuals that uh - with whom I've consulted have not uh - convinced me that uh - a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem you're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	11260	I support the right to keep and bear arms.	0
ClaimBuster	11261	The President exempts the IRS which creates three-fourths of the paperwork.	1
ClaimBuster	11262	Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country.	1
ClaimBuster	11263	Our long-term interest rates are still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance.	1
ClaimBuster	11264	support the uh - Republican uh - platform, which calls for the constitutional amendment that would uh - outlaw abortions.	1
ClaimBuster	11265	It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.	0
ClaimBuster	11266	We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide.	0
ClaimBuster	11267	We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.	0
ClaimBuster	11268	"If we don't have access to their markets the same way they've access our markets, we ought to say, ""Wait, that's enough."	0
ClaimBuster	11269	And we're going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	11270	Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	11271	Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him.	0
ClaimBuster	11272	And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.	0
ClaimBuster	11273	And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.	0
ClaimBuster	11274	The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	11275	"And I once called on somebody, ""Well, change your behavior."	1
ClaimBuster	11276	Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	11277	That gets to the national honor.	0
ClaimBuster	11278	That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	11279	And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	11280	The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.	0
ClaimBuster	11281	And nothing has been done, and they are now charging to take tourists there to see this terrible desolation.	1
ClaimBuster	11282	One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component.	0
ClaimBuster	11283	We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.	1
ClaimBuster	11284	And then you cut education spending when you came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	11285	And meanwhile, North Korea has got nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	11286	As a matter of fact, in the proposal for the Alaska lands legislation, 100% of all the offshore lands would be open for exploration, and 95% of all the Alaska lands, where it is suspected or believed that minerals might exist.	1
ClaimBuster	11287	There is now a federal judge's opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judge's language about this.	1
ClaimBuster	11288	We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.	1
ClaimBuster	11289	This Janet Yellen of the Fed.	0
ClaimBuster	11290	Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security.	0
ClaimBuster	11291	And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	11292	Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed.	0
ClaimBuster	11293	And his Secretary of the Treasury said he's studying a sales tax or a value-added tax.	1
ClaimBuster	11294	And local -- it's not enough to leave it up to the local school districts.	0
ClaimBuster	11295	Let me say this about AIDS.	0
ClaimBuster	11296	I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti.	0
ClaimBuster	11297	And the black market sale price was about $250 million.	1
ClaimBuster	11298	I will not cut our commitment to our military.	0
ClaimBuster	11299	But we cannot guarantee equal results in America.	0
ClaimBuster	11300	The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh - hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh - supporting the bill.	1
ClaimBuster	11301	He's called them phony and fuzzy.	0
ClaimBuster	11302	So, in terms of priorities, we've got to be financially strong.	0
ClaimBuster	11303	And I'm going to try to do better.	0
ClaimBuster	11304	Now this tax bill - that hasn't reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two - it's about fifteen hundred pages.	1
ClaimBuster	11305	This has hurt this country, and a President's supposed to command.	0
ClaimBuster	11306	Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	11307	As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	11308	We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.	1
ClaimBuster	11309	We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.	0
ClaimBuster	11310	The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.	1
ClaimBuster	11311	I think we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	11312	I have recommended to the Congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, which is a publicly owned - U.S. government facility and have indicated that the private program which would follow on in Alabama is one that may or may not uhh - be constructed.	1
ClaimBuster	11313	I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	11314	I disagree with both of them.	0
ClaimBuster	11315	He's already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we -- we're not going to get money that way.	1
ClaimBuster	11316	You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	11317	I think we need a president who has the credibility to bring the allies back to the table and to do what's necessary to make it so America isn't doing this alone.	0
ClaimBuster	11318	When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	11319	So -- but, look, you're not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers.	0
ClaimBuster	11320	It's about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America.	0
ClaimBuster	11321	Obviously if Social Security is a very important program, it should -- it will be preserved.	0
ClaimBuster	11322	And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.	0
ClaimBuster	11323	My plan drops the rate from 15% to 10% and increases the child credit from $500 to $1,000 to make the code more fair for everybody, not just a few, not just a handful.	1
ClaimBuster	11324	And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.	1
ClaimBuster	11325	I see it as a security issue, I see it as an economic issue, and I see it as a human-rights issue.	0
ClaimBuster	11326	I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida.	1
ClaimBuster	11327	I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.	0
ClaimBuster	11328	What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren't loopholes.	1
ClaimBuster	11329	It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.	0
ClaimBuster	11330	Keep the Federal Reserve independent, but let's live in a world of reality.	0
ClaimBuster	11331	But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.	0
ClaimBuster	11332	You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	11333	For the first time in history, you will be taxing people's health care benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	11334	He didn't happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests.	0
ClaimBuster	11335	Do you remember the Senator from Boston chanting out there and the ridicule factor from that lady from Texas that was on there; I mean, come on, this was just outrageous.	0
ClaimBuster	11336	I hope he would grant me the same.	0
ClaimBuster	11337	This nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate.	0
ClaimBuster	11338	You've suggested a commission, Newt Gingrich did, I suggested that at least four or five years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	11339	I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.	0
ClaimBuster	11340	And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.	1
ClaimBuster	11341	Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	11342	In other words, what I'm talking about is not putting government back to getting less money than government's been getting, but simply cutting the increase in in spending.	0
ClaimBuster	11343	Thank you, all of you, for taking part.	0
ClaimBuster	11344	But we didn't use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him.	1
ClaimBuster	11345	He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.	1
ClaimBuster	11346	I'm going to get it right for those soldiers, because it's important to Israel, it's important to America, it's important to the world, it's important to the fight on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	11347	He did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	11348	But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.	1
ClaimBuster	11349	I said that we would create jobs for our people, and we did -- 6 million in the last 20 or 21 months.	1
ClaimBuster	11350	The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.	0
ClaimBuster	11351	You should expect that from both of us.	0
ClaimBuster	11352	It's been my record as Governor of Texas, it will be how I conduct myself if I'm fortunate enough to earn your vote as President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11353	Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject.	0
ClaimBuster	11354	A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	11355	My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	11356	The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...	0
ClaimBuster	11357	Not until again in 1996 -- I don't want anybody to smoke.	0
ClaimBuster	11358	Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that.	1
ClaimBuster	11359	Jim, we have a direct disagreement on this.	0
ClaimBuster	11360	They do have stakes in it.	0
ClaimBuster	11361	But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on.	1
ClaimBuster	11362	But don't get into this smoke screen here Oscar.	0
ClaimBuster	11363	If you're in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	11364	There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally.	1
ClaimBuster	11365	Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate.	0
ClaimBuster	11366	She wants to have open borders.	1
ClaimBuster	11367	I know the morality that's prompting that question, and I respect it enormously.	0
ClaimBuster	11368	And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he.	0
ClaimBuster	11369	And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run.	0
ClaimBuster	11370	And so let me just say this.	0
ClaimBuster	11371	I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.	0
ClaimBuster	11372	Is -- is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?	0
ClaimBuster	11373	He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings.	1
ClaimBuster	11374	I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	11375	I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.	0
ClaimBuster	11376	"That I don't think is an example of ""speaking softly."""	0
ClaimBuster	11377	A message just won't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	11378	And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.	0
ClaimBuster	11379	Here is Ahmadinenene (ph), Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, they've probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.	1
ClaimBuster	11380	In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here.	1
ClaimBuster	11381	The governor's wife has been very active in the homeless.	1
ClaimBuster	11382	I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.	1
ClaimBuster	11383	One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	11384	Your question is difficult to answer, because, in the situation right now, no one wants to say anything that would inadvertently delay, in any way, the return of those hostages if there if there is a chance that they're coming home soon, or that might cause them harm.	0
ClaimBuster	11385	And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.	0
ClaimBuster	11386	There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.	1
ClaimBuster	11387	Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.	1
ClaimBuster	11388	You don't test every year.	0
ClaimBuster	11389	I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.	1
ClaimBuster	11390	(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature.	0
ClaimBuster	11391	He says he wants a system that will make nuclear wars safe, so nobody's going to get hurt.	0
ClaimBuster	11392	I think we have to respect that.	0
ClaimBuster	11393	We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.	1
ClaimBuster	11394	And we can do better than the past administration has done.	0
ClaimBuster	11395	That will not help us compete with China.	1
ClaimBuster	11396	We've become almost a welfare state.	0
ClaimBuster	11397	We found out today that over the past 13 months, we've added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months.	1
ClaimBuster	11398	And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.	0
ClaimBuster	11399	A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	11400	But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	11401	Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I'm trying to do is increase our exports.	1
ClaimBuster	11402	I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin, Texas, is that I've had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	11403	We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't want us very -- like us very much.	1
ClaimBuster	11404	So I'm the only one that's untarnished at this point?	0
ClaimBuster	11405	We need to have strong allies.	0
ClaimBuster	11406	But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile.	0
ClaimBuster	11407	And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope.	1
ClaimBuster	11408	Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way.	1
ClaimBuster	11409	I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.	0
ClaimBuster	11410	We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.	0
ClaimBuster	11411	In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.	1
ClaimBuster	11412	So I think that could help.	0
ClaimBuster	11413	Now, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	11414	If we're not an economic superpower, we're a used to be and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11415	I will tell you I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation.	0
ClaimBuster	11416	Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	11417	He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86.	1
ClaimBuster	11418	You know, Bob, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	11419	What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today they're producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	11420	On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time.	0
ClaimBuster	11421	Well, it starts with enforcing law.	0
ClaimBuster	11422	You see the turmoil in Poland today.	0
ClaimBuster	11423	Mr. Bush made that charge.	1
ClaimBuster	11424	I'd like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto.	1
ClaimBuster	11425	We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.	1
ClaimBuster	11426	I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.	0
ClaimBuster	11427	So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.	0
ClaimBuster	11428	But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.	0
ClaimBuster	11429	If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	11430	So that really isn't an issue in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	11431	I tell it like it is.	0
ClaimBuster	11432	I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend.	0
ClaimBuster	11433	I'm a governor of state and I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do.	1
ClaimBuster	11434	In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.	1
ClaimBuster	11435	This administration tried to take over healthcare and impose a governmental system.	1
ClaimBuster	11436	The gun lobby's on his side.	1
ClaimBuster	11437	And it also requires us to maintain some continuity -- some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.	0
ClaimBuster	11438	He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own.	1
ClaimBuster	11439	We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and they have done very well.	0
ClaimBuster	11440	I have kept the faith with our country.	0
ClaimBuster	11441	I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror by strengthening our military, strengthening our intelligence, by going after the financing more authoritatively, by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances, by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the president has almost not done, and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	11442	And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.	1
ClaimBuster	11443	The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves.	0
ClaimBuster	11444	At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.	0
ClaimBuster	11445	Maybe they -- they probably are addictive.	0
ClaimBuster	11446	I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.	1
ClaimBuster	11447	They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	11448	Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.	1
ClaimBuster	11449	So 80% -- now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	11450	I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	11451	We're suing each other too much and caring for each other too little.	0
ClaimBuster	11452	I think it's, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	11453	I'm in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance.	1
ClaimBuster	11454	Let's do it that way.	0
ClaimBuster	11455	It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.	1
ClaimBuster	11456	Some time ago, Mr. Mondale said something about education and college students and help of that kind.	1
ClaimBuster	11457	Well, thank you, Oliver, and that's an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that it's rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that.	1
ClaimBuster	11458	We've got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now.	1
ClaimBuster	11459	He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free.	0
ClaimBuster	11460	And that cost us revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	11461	"Yes, I had used -- ""last resort'' would always be with me."	0
ClaimBuster	11462	But 9/11 changed it all.	0
ClaimBuster	11463	It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.	1
ClaimBuster	11464	So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.	0
ClaimBuster	11465	We need to do this together and we can.	0
ClaimBuster	11466	John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains.	1
ClaimBuster	11467	So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.	0
ClaimBuster	11468	Iran has power over North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	11469	It was just right through the roof.	0
ClaimBuster	11470	The president has been AWOL for four years.	1
ClaimBuster	11471	We have to practice what we preach.	0
ClaimBuster	11472	Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in all the newspapers.	1
ClaimBuster	11473	We need to be doing more in education, not less.	0
ClaimBuster	11474	Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming.	0
ClaimBuster	11475	And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	11476	I have fought against excessive spending and outrages.	1
ClaimBuster	11477	We have to have strong borders.	0
ClaimBuster	11478	Our hearts go out to you.	0
ClaimBuster	11479	Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October.	1
ClaimBuster	11480	We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.	1
ClaimBuster	11481	I remember what the administration tried to do in 1993.	0
ClaimBuster	11482	During the course of the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the death penalty.	1
ClaimBuster	11483	The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesn't stop there.	0
ClaimBuster	11484	Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	11485	The drunk driver had no money.	1
ClaimBuster	11486	I have seen Communism abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	11487	I have a clear record of bipartisanship.	1
ClaimBuster	11488	Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	11489	Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	11490	Number four, the rule of law.	0
ClaimBuster	11491	And I was very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	11492	He said he would work through a real alliance.	1
ClaimBuster	11493	In addition to that, we need to have - uh a realization that we've got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world.	1
ClaimBuster	11494	Now, it's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.	0
ClaimBuster	11495	We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we've got to control the health care costs for those people -- otherwise we can't keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets.	0
ClaimBuster	11496	We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral.	0
ClaimBuster	11497	And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we're doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon's view.	0
ClaimBuster	11498	That was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us.	0
ClaimBuster	11499	If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be glad to go up there and we'll get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	11500	At the same time, in our Judeo-Christian tradition, we recognize the right of taking a human life in self-defense.	1
ClaimBuster	11501	I think the real winners of the debates were the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	11502	Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	11503	And that's what this country should be doing.	0
ClaimBuster	11504	Meanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some -- and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing.	1
ClaimBuster	11505	I think he gets a -- oh, I'm sorry, you're right, go ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	11506	We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	11507	Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets?	0
ClaimBuster	11508	We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	11509	I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.	1
ClaimBuster	11510	Governor Clinton keeps hitting me on vetoing legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	11511	Again, I will say I will do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults.	0
ClaimBuster	11512	And that's to make sure the education system works.	0
ClaimBuster	11513	You voted to increase taxes 98 times.	1
ClaimBuster	11514	I would pick somebody who would strictly interpret the Constitution of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11515	Now, this is not standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	11516	I think we've been fighting from day one to do something about the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	11517	I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not.	0
ClaimBuster	11518	A lot of people are sick and tired of the bitterness in Washington, D.C. and therefore they don't want any part of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	11519	Before I hit the ground, my cell phone rang and this trial lawyer said, I think we've got a case here.	1
ClaimBuster	11520	"Actually just going to them and saying, ""We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate."""	1
ClaimBuster	11521	I'm standing here as proof that in America the possibilities are unlimited.	0
ClaimBuster	11522	As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11523	However, if the insurance company doesn't follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law.	0
ClaimBuster	11524	And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.	0
ClaimBuster	11525	But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues.	0
ClaimBuster	11526	There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children.	1
ClaimBuster	11527	In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.	0
ClaimBuster	11528	The last year I was in office uh - our budget was - was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement.	1
ClaimBuster	11529	You can quote all the numbers you want, but I'm telling you we care about our people in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	11530	I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.	0
ClaimBuster	11531	And I think it will happen in my lifetime.	0
ClaimBuster	11532	I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	11533	My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country.	0
ClaimBuster	11534	And one of the reasons our selection of a running mate is so important, it is such a test of the kinds of standards we'll set, is because it tells the American people in advance of the election just what kind of people we're looking for.	0
ClaimBuster	11535	Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.	0
ClaimBuster	11536	As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.	1
ClaimBuster	11537	And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.	0
ClaimBuster	11538	We've wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry.	1
ClaimBuster	11539	Oh, you're going to let me.	0
ClaimBuster	11540	Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.	0
ClaimBuster	11541	But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?	0
ClaimBuster	11542	We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families.	0
ClaimBuster	11543	Federal funding for education is up substantially -- Pell grants are up.	1
ClaimBuster	11544	The sooner the better off we'll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him.	0
ClaimBuster	11545	You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.	0
ClaimBuster	11546	But I built a phenomenal company.	0
ClaimBuster	11547	And we have a very important decision to make.	0
ClaimBuster	11548	And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.	1
ClaimBuster	11549	When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo.	0
ClaimBuster	11550	I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future.	0
ClaimBuster	11551	I just care whether it works for America and whether it's going to make us stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	11552	We know where they're cutting.	0
ClaimBuster	11553	We took it out of politics.	1
ClaimBuster	11554	Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost.	1
ClaimBuster	11555	The same country that's helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that's killing young Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	11556	And also General Petraeus said the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	11557	But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we're asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh - we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation.	0
ClaimBuster	11558	And so if Kim Jong Il decides again to not honor an agreement, he's not only doing injustice to America, he'd be doing injustice to China, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	11559	Crime has gone down but it's because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City.	1
ClaimBuster	11560	We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view.	0
ClaimBuster	11561	We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system.	0
ClaimBuster	11562	They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11563	With interest rates down and inflation down, the cruelest tax of all, caught up in a global slowdown right now, that that will change if you go with the programs I've talked about and if you help with job retraining and education.	1
ClaimBuster	11564	We hadn't caught bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	11565	And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	11566	Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country.	1
ClaimBuster	11567	You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.	1
ClaimBuster	11568	But that's not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	11569	But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.	1
ClaimBuster	11570	Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.	0
ClaimBuster	11571	I would indict him for it.	0
ClaimBuster	11572	If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent -- we're not far from there -- by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level.	1
ClaimBuster	11573	We don't need mass armies anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	11574	Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out.	0
ClaimBuster	11575	We have worked hard for peace and freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	11576	Let me tell you what I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	11577	I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.	0
ClaimBuster	11578	It's cut federal aid to education; it's cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country.	1
ClaimBuster	11579	I make those charts you see on television.	1
ClaimBuster	11580	But we've also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies.	0
ClaimBuster	11581	We don't yet know what our tax revenues are going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	11582	So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.	0
ClaimBuster	11583	And it's fair, shared sacrifice to do the right thing for our country and for our children.	0
ClaimBuster	11584	That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending.	1
ClaimBuster	11585	I just don't believe we ought to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	11586	America has a lot of families that are in trouble today.	0
ClaimBuster	11587	Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	11588	The American people want arms control.	0
ClaimBuster	11589	And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff.	1
ClaimBuster	11590	What I ask is this.	0
ClaimBuster	11591	Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.	1
ClaimBuster	11592	And are they good for our national security?	0
ClaimBuster	11593	I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship.	0
ClaimBuster	11594	I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.	0
ClaimBuster	11595	But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks.	1
ClaimBuster	11596	In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite.	0
ClaimBuster	11597	And terrorist acts are such that our own United States Capitol in Washington has been bombed twice.	1
ClaimBuster	11598	And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	11599	2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country.	0
ClaimBuster	11600	You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.	0
ClaimBuster	11601	But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	11602	And I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has alluded everybody else because we know how to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	11603	There've been more disputes in its area where there's more volatility than any other place in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	11604	There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil.	0
ClaimBuster	11605	What's a question I think the -- the president will have a chance to answer right now.	0
ClaimBuster	11606	And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.	1
ClaimBuster	11607	That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.	0
ClaimBuster	11608	And it hasn't been finished at all.	1
ClaimBuster	11609	I don't think most people do.	0
ClaimBuster	11610	When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.	1
ClaimBuster	11611	If they're space weapons, I assume they'll be in space.	0
ClaimBuster	11612	If I'm poor and you're rich, and I can get you to defend me, that's good.	0
ClaimBuster	11613	Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.	1
ClaimBuster	11614	I think science is real.	0
ClaimBuster	11615	But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.	1
ClaimBuster	11616	I know what it takes to create good jobs again.	0
ClaimBuster	11617	But there's still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	11618	And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military.	0
ClaimBuster	11619	A jury found them guilty.	1
ClaimBuster	11620	It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	11621	I talk about strengthening the American family and it's very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and, you know, send their kid down to get a loaf of bread.	0
ClaimBuster	11622	And here I do have, on this particular question, a big difference with my opponent.	0
ClaimBuster	11623	A lot of folks on Medicare are out there every day making the choice between food and medicine; not poor enough for Medicare-Medicaid, not wealthy enough to buy their medicine.	1
ClaimBuster	11624	Robert Rubin looked at his plan and said it won't work.	1
ClaimBuster	11625	Remember, it's your money; it's not his money.	0
ClaimBuster	11626	Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don't change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	11627	But here's the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them.	0
ClaimBuster	11628	I agree that we cannot commit ground forces to become involved in the quagmire of Bosnia or in the tribal wars of Somalia.	0
ClaimBuster	11629	I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but I'm not for a government-run system.	0
ClaimBuster	11630	I said we'd get tougher with child support and child support enforcement's up 50 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	11631	And uh - I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia.	0
ClaimBuster	11632	We need the things in it that coordinate the FBI and the CIA.	0
ClaimBuster	11633	Many would trade for it.	0
ClaimBuster	11634	I didn't need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	11635	The Governor may not have heard my uh - established criteria for the selection of a vice president, but uh - it was a well-established criteria that the person I selected would be fully qualified to be president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	11636	But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	11637	They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.	1
ClaimBuster	11638	I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both.	1
ClaimBuster	11639	We are better off than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	11640	What happens -- the money goes to them.	0
ClaimBuster	11641	And we've got to make sure that we reduce our deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	11642	We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.	0
ClaimBuster	11643	Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.	1
ClaimBuster	11644	Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition.	1
ClaimBuster	11645	In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.	1
ClaimBuster	11646	And what's happened in the meantime?	0
ClaimBuster	11647	It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it.	0
ClaimBuster	11648	John Edwards and I support tort reform.	1
ClaimBuster	11649	But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	11650	He'd been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	11651	We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we've told you where the money is coming from.	1
ClaimBuster	11652	And I'll tell you exactly how.	0
ClaimBuster	11653	Well, John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years.	1
ClaimBuster	11654	You can't bring back jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	11655	Now that's not a flip-flop.	0
ClaimBuster	11656	That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh - that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh - correction, but he still insists uh - on repeating an erroneous statement.	1
ClaimBuster	11657	But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace.	0
ClaimBuster	11658	"A year ago he said, ""I was right then."	1
ClaimBuster	11659	I'm going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.	0
ClaimBuster	11660	My faith affects everything that I do, in truth.	0
ClaimBuster	11661	And the principles that we put in place, we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to -- to be able compete, but also if they graduated the quarter of their class, they got a four-year tuition- free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning.	1
ClaimBuster	11662	With all this instability and breaking into republics, and all the Middle Eastern countries going over there and shopping for weapons, we've got our work cut out for us.	1
ClaimBuster	11663	And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	11664	These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.	1
ClaimBuster	11665	The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.	1
ClaimBuster	11666	And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.	0
ClaimBuster	11667	You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.	1
ClaimBuster	11668	The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say.	0
ClaimBuster	11669	But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.	0
ClaimBuster	11670	I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	11671	And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that's unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	11672	We will take a look.	0
ClaimBuster	11673	And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care.	0
ClaimBuster	11674	The Soviet Union is no more and we're working with a democratic country.	1
ClaimBuster	11675	Tonight in the audience there's one elected state senator who is a Democrat, a former state-wide officer who is a Democrat, a lot of Democrats who are here in the debate to -- because they want to show their support that shows I know how to lead.	1
ClaimBuster	11676	Does that make you feel safer in America?	0
ClaimBuster	11677	But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	11678	He did block it, because we passed it in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	11679	In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.	0
ClaimBuster	11680	And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question.	0
ClaimBuster	11681	And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.	1
ClaimBuster	11682	Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	11683	I'm not sure where he's coming from.	0
ClaimBuster	11684	He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	11685	And so, my change had come earlier than that.	1
ClaimBuster	11686	They didn't view their service as a back-door draft.	1
ClaimBuster	11687	"Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, ""you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,"" you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option."	1
ClaimBuster	11688	It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	11689	And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	11690	With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	11691	And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well.	0
ClaimBuster	11692	So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?	0
ClaimBuster	11693	Who's the best person to manage money?	0
ClaimBuster	11694	I don't think you can deny that.	0
ClaimBuster	11695	He is an indicted war criminal.	1
ClaimBuster	11696	Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America?	0
ClaimBuster	11697	The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	11698	That's the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma.	0
ClaimBuster	11699	And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.	1
ClaimBuster	11700	I thank you for that.	0
ClaimBuster	11701	I'll keep you in suspense.	0
ClaimBuster	11702	I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	11703	I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	11704	You've got to read what he said...	0
ClaimBuster	11705	And so I've told him my opinion.	1
ClaimBuster	11706	I don't have a one of them, and I haven't taken a penny of foreign money, and I never will.	1
ClaimBuster	11707	That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.	0
ClaimBuster	11708	I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	11709	Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.	1
ClaimBuster	11710	It's a great question about Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	11711	I believe in the need for increased oil production.	0
ClaimBuster	11712	But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?	1
ClaimBuster	11713	Four Democrats voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	11714	And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.	0
ClaimBuster	11715	So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not.	0
ClaimBuster	11716	First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe.	1
ClaimBuster	11717	We came into office and the Social Security Trust Fund was in great jeopardy and the President took the leadership working with the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress some tough calls were made and the Social Security Trust Fund was put back into sound, solvent condition.	1
ClaimBuster	11718	How do you make them bring the jobs back?	0
ClaimBuster	11719	You don't have anywhere to sleep.	0
ClaimBuster	11720	"We're shipping the quote, ""low paying jobs"" overseas."	0
ClaimBuster	11721	I'm -- I'm -- I'm happy.	0
ClaimBuster	11722	I believe that this country is electing more and more African Americans and Latinos and Asian Americans who are representing districts that are themselves not necessarily of a majority of their race.	0
ClaimBuster	11723	I believe that since I've been in office, there have been six or eight areas of combat evolved in other parts of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	11724	I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity.	0
ClaimBuster	11725	This one must be stepped up.	0
ClaimBuster	11726	You look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to 10 years.	0
ClaimBuster	11727	No attack ever created a job or educated a child, or helped a family make ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	11728	Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.	0
ClaimBuster	11729	I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.	0
ClaimBuster	11730	But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti.	1
ClaimBuster	11731	It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	11732	On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	11733	All the people I've met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children.	0
ClaimBuster	11734	There are so many things there, I don't quite know where to begin.	0
ClaimBuster	11735	You can also deduct long-term care now, so it's a good it's a good start.	0
ClaimBuster	11736	I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut.	0
ClaimBuster	11737	I don't trust the Russians.	0
ClaimBuster	11738	That's got to be changed.	0
ClaimBuster	11739	-- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.	0
ClaimBuster	11740	And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize.	0
ClaimBuster	11741	I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.	0
ClaimBuster	11742	Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	11743	I have -- I understand everybody in this country doesn't agree with the decisions I've made.	1
ClaimBuster	11744	We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	11745	The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?	0
ClaimBuster	11746	Thank you very much, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	11747	And so, we have set a standard that those loans and those grants are directed to the people who otherwise could not go to college, their family incomes were so low.	0
ClaimBuster	11748	And we need to be very clear about that.	0
ClaimBuster	11749	Gene, there is a problem in the sense that there are some problem banks, and on December 19th new regulations will go into effect which will in effect give the government the responsibility to close some banks that are not technically insolvent but that are plainly in trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	11750	I don√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢t know where the vice president stands but that√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s a renewable energy source of energy.	0
ClaimBuster	11751	Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000.	1
ClaimBuster	11752	They were eventually saying, Mexican jobs will eventually come to $7.50 an hour, ours will eventually go down to $7.50 an hour.	1
ClaimBuster	11753	I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes.	0
ClaimBuster	11754	But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.	0
ClaimBuster	11755	So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	11756	Lester, one thing I'd like to say.	0
ClaimBuster	11757	I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.	0
ClaimBuster	11758	Let's think it through here.	0
ClaimBuster	11759	Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.	0
ClaimBuster	11760	We reformed our school system, and now there's an achievement gap in America that's beginning to close.	0
ClaimBuster	11761	But take a look at the Democratic convention take a look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	11762	This is the only one country he's ever known.	1
ClaimBuster	11763	Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	11764	I will keep this nation strong.	0
ClaimBuster	11765	Because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions.	0
ClaimBuster	11766	I believe the president made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was: build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job and go through the U.N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort.	1
ClaimBuster	11767	We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and we're doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured.	1
ClaimBuster	11768	We ought to insist on access.	0
ClaimBuster	11769	That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.	0
ClaimBuster	11770	But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse.	1
ClaimBuster	11771	We don't give away our hand before we sit down at the head table.	0
ClaimBuster	11772	They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.	0
ClaimBuster	11773	It is going to require a new spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	11774	Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, amen.	0
ClaimBuster	11775	That's -- that's a big topic.	0
ClaimBuster	11776	Let me tell you another place to look for some savings.	0
ClaimBuster	11777	This isn't a question of a little charity for the homeless.	0
ClaimBuster	11778	They can't have an election right now.	0
ClaimBuster	11779	The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	11780	And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.	1
ClaimBuster	11781	I don't think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003.	0
ClaimBuster	11782	Secretary of State Colin Powell told this president the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	11783	On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration.	1
ClaimBuster	11784	The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.	1
ClaimBuster	11785	The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh - within Brazil.	1
ClaimBuster	11786	But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	11787	I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.	0
ClaimBuster	11788	I've served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	11789	And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free peninsula, Korean Peninsula, was in his interest and our interest and the world's interest.	1
ClaimBuster	11790	It penalizes the family farmer.	1
ClaimBuster	11791	We've already 75 percent of his people.	1
ClaimBuster	11792	Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem.	0
ClaimBuster	11793	I don't think we can do that for a few years.	0
ClaimBuster	11794	We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.	0
ClaimBuster	11795	I would just like to s- add this one point.	0
ClaimBuster	11796	I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.	0
ClaimBuster	11797	If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees.	1
ClaimBuster	11798	I want to have the military keeping the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	11799	The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	11800	Too many people have been left behind.	0
ClaimBuster	11801	Well, I'm reluctant to uh comment on the recent report - I haven't read it.	0
ClaimBuster	11802	Our values must be at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	11803	I'm the first governor to clean it up.	1
ClaimBuster	11804	That's after losing 5 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	11805	Well, is a homebuyer better off he can refinance the home, because interest rates are down?	0
ClaimBuster	11806	As a matter of fact, my opponent talks about inspectors.	1
ClaimBuster	11807	Now, here is the good news, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	11808	It's pretty clear you won't admit...	0
ClaimBuster	11809	We have low interest rates today.	1
ClaimBuster	11810	They're going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go.	0
ClaimBuster	11811	I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.	0
ClaimBuster	11812	And that's what they are.	0
ClaimBuster	11813	And I have done a lot...	1
ClaimBuster	11814	Now, we all know that we've got to do more.	0
ClaimBuster	11815	So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have prescription drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	11816	It not only liberated - uh black people but it also liberated the whites.	0
ClaimBuster	11817	If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.	1
ClaimBuster	11818	He lost the Iowa caucus.	1
ClaimBuster	11819	I√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ve got to protect them.	0
ClaimBuster	11820	Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	11821	I'd be happy to have you take a look.	0
ClaimBuster	11822	The president made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	11823	I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation.	0
ClaimBuster	11824	Look, we've got the biggest surpluses in all of American history.	1
ClaimBuster	11825	Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	11826	After the election, he'll get more backbone.	0
ClaimBuster	11827	We must have China's leverage on Kim Jong Il, besides ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	11828	That's what drug it out.	0
ClaimBuster	11829	And I have a plan that will take the catastrophic cases out of the system, off your backs, pay for it out of a federal fund, which lowers the premiums for everybody in America, makes American business more competitive and makes health care more affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	11830	"You know when members of the Republican Congress say, ""We're going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don't ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college."	0
ClaimBuster	11831	There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.	0
ClaimBuster	11832	But let's take my life in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	11833	The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	11834	Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.	0
ClaimBuster	11835	There will always be problems in this whole world.	0
ClaimBuster	11836	So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference.	0
ClaimBuster	11837	[Applause] I propose a budget -- I have proposed a budget which would increase our nation's strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	11838	While they didn't talk at all, the fuel rods came out, the inspectors were kicked out, the television cameras were kicked out.	1
ClaimBuster	11839	"What it means is that we don't do what we've been doing, which is to say, ""Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we won't have direct contacts with you."""	0
ClaimBuster	11840	I believe it was a failure of presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban.	0
ClaimBuster	11841	And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.	0
ClaimBuster	11842	I want to be able to tell my grandson when I'm in my later years that I didn't turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm.	0
ClaimBuster	11843	Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East.	1
ClaimBuster	11844	We√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢re the best and the most efficient farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	11845	I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors.	0
ClaimBuster	11846	I have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients' Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I have a long record of it.	1
ClaimBuster	11847	They don't go to war with each other.	0
ClaimBuster	11848	Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	11849	So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014.	0
ClaimBuster	11850	It hurts communities, because these are our first responders.	0
ClaimBuster	11851	It puts a heavy burden on a states like California.	1
ClaimBuster	11852	"And we said, ""Why not cut out the middleman?"""	0
ClaimBuster	11853	Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford.	0
ClaimBuster	11854	Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.	0
ClaimBuster	11855	I make no allegations about that.	0
ClaimBuster	11856	He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.	0
ClaimBuster	11857	It's just clear you can go to the website and look.	0
ClaimBuster	11858	I agree with the president: when they couldn't, we should have; now that they can, they should.	0
ClaimBuster	11859	We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.	0
ClaimBuster	11860	That's not what I'm going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	11861	As well, we included South Korea, Japan and Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	11862	I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	11863	The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how --	1
ClaimBuster	11864	President Carter also has spoken of the new jobs created.	1
ClaimBuster	11865	I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools.	0
ClaimBuster	11866	... including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown.	1
ClaimBuster	11867	And it has not been easy.	0
ClaimBuster	11868	It's going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco.	0
ClaimBuster	11869	We've been cleaning it up for four years.	1
ClaimBuster	11870	Parents now feel like you have to compete with the mass culture in order to raise your kids with the values that you want them to have.	0
ClaimBuster	11871	But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	11872	Nobody would have dreamed it possible.	0
ClaimBuster	11873	... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.	1
ClaimBuster	11874	And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.	0
ClaimBuster	11875	Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.	1
ClaimBuster	11876	I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.	1
ClaimBuster	11877	Over 50 percent - 53 to be exact - percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we've had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	11878	I don't want to go back to the Carter grain embargo on the Soviets.	0
ClaimBuster	11879	And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists.	0
ClaimBuster	11880	And we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now, because we have more to lose in space then they do.	0
ClaimBuster	11881	Eh- He was talking about the Castro regime and what we had been eh- doing in Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	11882	You can't expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	11883	Now, that's not in my gut.	0
ClaimBuster	11884	I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	11885	There's enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	11886	And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.	0
ClaimBuster	11887	That's the good news, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	11888	You weren't impressed with the fact that he --	0
ClaimBuster	11889	One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.	1
ClaimBuster	11890	But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat.	0
ClaimBuster	11891	Well, I think they're serious.	0
ClaimBuster	11892	I don't think you have to -- shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally.	0
ClaimBuster	11893	And yet, in the last nine months of this year, we've had a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain.	1
ClaimBuster	11894	Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.	0
ClaimBuster	11895	The American people want their children educated.	0
ClaimBuster	11896	I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.	0
ClaimBuster	11897	Thank you very, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	11898	Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support.	1
ClaimBuster	11899	If he gets elected president, we'll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the President representing education in our children.	0
ClaimBuster	11900	"General Shinseki had the wisdom to say, ""You're going to need several hundred thousand troops to win the peace."""	1
ClaimBuster	11901	The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth.	0
ClaimBuster	11902	And we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some -- Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	11903	I don't know how you draw that line.	0
ClaimBuster	11904	But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.	1
ClaimBuster	11905	But it didn't mean that.	0
ClaimBuster	11906	And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees.	1
ClaimBuster	11907	Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish.	1
ClaimBuster	11908	Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	11909	This is a time -- this should have been a time for American leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	11910	His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.	0
ClaimBuster	11911	Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.	1
ClaimBuster	11912	I've learned from them that people do have tough times.	1
ClaimBuster	11913	We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.	0
ClaimBuster	11914	That's its most basic function.	0
ClaimBuster	11915	I know this to be a fact because I had one tell me last week, Senator don't cut my Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	11916	It's up to the people in this region to take control of their country.	0
ClaimBuster	11917	And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	11918	But I know, as I think you do, that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	11919	And that's what I intend to do as president.	0
ClaimBuster	11920	Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process.	1
ClaimBuster	11921	It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.	0
ClaimBuster	11922	And I just had to work that in.	0
ClaimBuster	11923	The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	11924	But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.	0
ClaimBuster	11925	But if you can check up on them, that's real power.	0
ClaimBuster	11926	When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade.	1
ClaimBuster	11927	But I think the feeling is misplaced.	0
ClaimBuster	11928	If you're going to die, you don't have to go through this ten-year cycle that FDA goes through on new drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	11929	And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished.	0
ClaimBuster	11930	I think he made my case.	0
ClaimBuster	11931	All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields - education, housing, defense - that will move America forward.	0
ClaimBuster	11932	I mean, I -- because I think whoever is the president must guard your liberties, must not erode your rights in America.	0
ClaimBuster	11933	I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	11934	First of all, the people of my state have let me be their governor for 12 years because I made commitments to 2 things -- more jobs and better schools.	1
ClaimBuster	11935	We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	11936	What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it, his last statement, call for an unconditional end of the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution.	0
ClaimBuster	11937	Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.	0
ClaimBuster	11938	Well, just briefly, I - I think this is uh - the second time that General Brown has made a statement that - for which he did have to apologize.	1
ClaimBuster	11939	Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending?	0
ClaimBuster	11940	Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	11941	You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	11942	Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.	0
ClaimBuster	11943	So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?	0
ClaimBuster	11944	And he was down there fighting against imperialism.	1
ClaimBuster	11945	As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.	1
ClaimBuster	11946	We're no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in - in any other international council we're lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us.	1
ClaimBuster	11947	Most small businesses are Subchapter S corps.	1
ClaimBuster	11948	The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there.	0
ClaimBuster	11949	First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets.	0
ClaimBuster	11950	And it's important for them.	0
ClaimBuster	11951	Let's look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	11952	There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.	1
ClaimBuster	11953	But in the process of that we have saved uhh - $9 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	11954	Senator Obama likes to talk loudly.	0
ClaimBuster	11955	And we will take care of Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	11956	"And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: ""Well, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow."""	0
ClaimBuster	11957	Let's get back to Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	11958	I'm sorry, you actually -- there was a -- there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on.	1
ClaimBuster	11959	Secondly, the relations between Russia and China.	0
ClaimBuster	11960	First of all, there are two different things.	0
ClaimBuster	11961	Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.	0
ClaimBuster	11962	And it's the right cause.	0
ClaimBuster	11963	When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day.	1
ClaimBuster	11964	Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.	0
ClaimBuster	11965	Now, Japanese couldn't unload the cars in this country if they had the same restrictions we had, and on and on and on and on and on.	1
ClaimBuster	11966	In fact, some T-shirts that are very...	0
ClaimBuster	11967	As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	11968	So I think we are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans.	0
ClaimBuster	11969	That can't -- that can't be left to stand.	0
ClaimBuster	11970	And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender?	0
ClaimBuster	11971	Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun.	0
ClaimBuster	11972	We had to make cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	11973	That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.	1
ClaimBuster	11974	This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies.	1
ClaimBuster	11975	And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.	1
ClaimBuster	11976	But let me tell you specifically what my plan does.	0
ClaimBuster	11977	And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	11978	That's what reporters called it.	1
ClaimBuster	11979	Or whether it be Nixon's trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went.	1
ClaimBuster	11980	Four years ago you took me on faith.	1
ClaimBuster	11981	And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference.	1
ClaimBuster	11982	And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it.	0
ClaimBuster	11983	But, I've learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50.	0
ClaimBuster	11984	We've also seen a very serious uh - problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there's an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	11985	Where every eight-year-old can read.	0
ClaimBuster	11986	Let's take all these four years in a row.	0
ClaimBuster	11987	That costs the government $7,700 per family.	1
ClaimBuster	11988	I am sure that that will not happen.	0
ClaimBuster	11989	I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.	1
ClaimBuster	11990	I just do want to say one thing, however.	0
ClaimBuster	11991	Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues.	0
ClaimBuster	11992	Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.	1
ClaimBuster	11993	We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	11994	That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	11995	I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	11996	So we have a very robust set of plans.	0
ClaimBuster	11997	Now that's not a government takeover.	0
ClaimBuster	11998	He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.	1
ClaimBuster	11999	I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	12000	It's a very tense situation there.	0
ClaimBuster	12001	I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.	0
ClaimBuster	12002	And the answer is, yes, if I'm president, America will be very strong.	0
ClaimBuster	12003	But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.	0
ClaimBuster	12004	Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.	1
ClaimBuster	12005	I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year.	1
ClaimBuster	12006	There is another point that should be made.	0
ClaimBuster	12007	And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander-in-Chief.	1
ClaimBuster	12008	This is the first time the United States of America has ever had a tax cut when we're at war.	1
ClaimBuster	12009	A good family is a place where love and discipline and good values are transmuted (sic) from the elders to the children, a place where people turn for refuge, and where they know they're the most important people in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12010	We do need to look at our records.	0
ClaimBuster	12011	The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care.	1
ClaimBuster	12012	I think we should have an educational system second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	12013	Let me tell you one thing I didn't sign, and I think it shows the difference of our opinion -- the difference of opinions.	0
ClaimBuster	12014	I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.	0
ClaimBuster	12015	If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them.	0
ClaimBuster	12016	It's probably the worst one of all.	0
ClaimBuster	12017	We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.	1
ClaimBuster	12018	He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that we're reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population.	1
ClaimBuster	12019	The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things.	1
ClaimBuster	12020	You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.	1
ClaimBuster	12021	I come from a different point.	0
ClaimBuster	12022	I wanted to get something done.	0
ClaimBuster	12023	Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	12024	Why didn't you add other things into the deal?	0
ClaimBuster	12025	No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending	0
ClaimBuster	12026	And that's the difference between the president and me.	0
ClaimBuster	12027	Well, I have a different view.	0
ClaimBuster	12028	I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you've had on making this a more positive experience.	0
ClaimBuster	12029	We have to be able to make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	12030	It would be neat and plausible and wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	12031	Then the Embassy was blown up a few weeks ago, and once again none of the steps that should have been taken were taken.	1
ClaimBuster	12032	We just don't want to see it creep back up.	0
ClaimBuster	12033	The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system.	0
ClaimBuster	12034	The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh - influence and power in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	12035	It's something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement.	0
ClaimBuster	12036	I have -- was fought for a very strong title in the farm bill for the conservation reserve program to set aside millions of acres of land to help improve wildlife and the habitat.	1
ClaimBuster	12037	And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power.	0
ClaimBuster	12038	And I've never wavered in my life.	0
ClaimBuster	12039	And we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	12040	That's part of an overall overhaul.	0
ClaimBuster	12041	I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.	1
ClaimBuster	12042	Thank you Kerry for your question, it's an important one.	0
ClaimBuster	12043	And, you know, that's -- you're right.	0
ClaimBuster	12044	We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	12045	And I'm so glad I did it.	0
ClaimBuster	12046	If you want to participate in some of the dynamic changes that are going on in our country, you will get specific help in doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	12047	Let me come back and say, why is it that I don't want to raise taxes?	0
ClaimBuster	12048	And here you've got, for the disadvantaged children, you've got to have early childhood development.	0
ClaimBuster	12049	They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.	1
ClaimBuster	12050	More sometimes than people in foreign countries.	0
ClaimBuster	12051	The governor proposes $45 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	12052	And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.	0
ClaimBuster	12053	A tax increase, a tax on everybody in America.	1
ClaimBuster	12054	I retract nothing that I have said.	0
ClaimBuster	12055	Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world.	1
ClaimBuster	12056	Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.	0
ClaimBuster	12057	And the vast majority of all family businesses would be completely exempt, and all of the others would have sharply reduced.	1
ClaimBuster	12058	The person responsible for domestic economic policy in my administration will be Bill Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	12059	Use--work internationally to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	12060	I never got to say that.	0
ClaimBuster	12061	I can't fix the statistics.	0
ClaimBuster	12062	We are spending a fortune doing it.	1
ClaimBuster	12063	And we put up with that.	0
ClaimBuster	12064	First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	12065	They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh - fiscal policy of the uh - executive and legislative branches of the government.	0
ClaimBuster	12066	In public education when we just move children through the schools.	0
ClaimBuster	12067	We're talking about Joe the plumber.	0
ClaimBuster	12068	Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no Al Qaida before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	12069	Let me make one last point.	0
ClaimBuster	12070	Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there.	0
ClaimBuster	12071	The president actually cut the money for it.	1
ClaimBuster	12072	And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	12073	So I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again.	0
ClaimBuster	12074	We have spent $4 trillion worth.	1
ClaimBuster	12075	I'm not just saying this.	0
ClaimBuster	12076	He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.	1
ClaimBuster	12077	In the Oval Office, you can't predict what kind of crisis is going to come up.	0
ClaimBuster	12078	Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it's much clearer for me now.	0
ClaimBuster	12079	We need higher teachers' salaries.	0
ClaimBuster	12080	"They passed the resolution that said, ""Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences."""	1
ClaimBuster	12081	Now, I'll go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs.	0
ClaimBuster	12082	I've never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	12083	The rest of them know we're after them.	1
ClaimBuster	12084	So I went to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	12085	I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	12086	We hadn't done the work that ought to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	12087	The military's job is to win the war.	0
ClaimBuster	12088	But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	12089	There's a difference between being a quarterback and a cheerleader, and when there's a real problem, a President must confront it.	0
ClaimBuster	12090	In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand.	1
ClaimBuster	12091	And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.	1
ClaimBuster	12092	He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.	1
ClaimBuster	12093	And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.	0
ClaimBuster	12094	We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.	1
ClaimBuster	12095	I do think it's fair to note -- he can rebut it -- but Arkansas is one of the few states that doesn't have any civil rights legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	12096	Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.	0
ClaimBuster	12097	I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.	0
ClaimBuster	12098	He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.	0
ClaimBuster	12099	There are actually more people in government except for people in defense related jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	12100	We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	12101	Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.	1
ClaimBuster	12102	And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	12103	If they weren't willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together.	0
ClaimBuster	12104	24 years ago I supported full public financing of all federal elections.	1
ClaimBuster	12105	So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	12106	If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.	0
ClaimBuster	12107	These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	12108	Instead of high unemployment, we now have the lowest African-American unemployment, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured.	1
ClaimBuster	12109	But we'll get the rest of that tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	12110	We haven't been paying attention to them.	0
ClaimBuster	12111	But is that really the question that should be asked?	0
ClaimBuster	12112	His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not.	1
ClaimBuster	12113	We have one of the most advanced patient's bill of rights.	1
ClaimBuster	12114	Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.	1
ClaimBuster	12115	Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.	0
ClaimBuster	12116	You have to earn that respect.	0
ClaimBuster	12117	The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.	0
ClaimBuster	12118	And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man.	0
ClaimBuster	12119	Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire.	0
ClaimBuster	12120	"And it used the term ""death of the unborn child.''"	1
ClaimBuster	12121	I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.	0
ClaimBuster	12122	One more time you've bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance.	0
ClaimBuster	12123	Folks, the test is not if you've added money; the test is that you've done everything possible to make America secure.	0
ClaimBuster	12124	So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	12125	Now, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	12126	I want to thank Arizona State as well.	0
ClaimBuster	12127	The Federal Reserve has uh - an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh - Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high.	1
ClaimBuster	12128	Why didn't we bring students over here?	0
ClaimBuster	12129	Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion.	1
ClaimBuster	12130	And we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place.	0
ClaimBuster	12131	Well, I've expressed my heartfelt difference with Governor Clinton on organizing demonstrations while in a foreign land against your country, when young ghetto kids have been drafted and are dying.	1
ClaimBuster	12132	If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in?	0
ClaimBuster	12133	The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them.	1
ClaimBuster	12134	He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.	0
ClaimBuster	12135	"A few years ago when he came to office, the president said -- these are his words -- ""What we need are some good conservative judges on the courts."""	1
ClaimBuster	12136	And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it.	0
ClaimBuster	12137	Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it.	1
ClaimBuster	12138	Everybody that pays taxes is going to get tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	12139	And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.	1
ClaimBuster	12140	But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA.	1
ClaimBuster	12141	And it's also regulatory reform.	0
ClaimBuster	12142	Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	12143	So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military.	0
ClaimBuster	12144	I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	12145	It hasn't produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal, or anything else in the line of energy.	1
ClaimBuster	12146	No, of course not, absolutely not, I want them to be tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	12147	I want to put money in your pocket.	0
ClaimBuster	12148	And I think that's great.	0
ClaimBuster	12149	... and a great first lady.	0
ClaimBuster	12150	I would like to point out also that senators like Henry Jackson and Hollings of South Carolina - they are taking the lead in the fight against this particular treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	12151	We have to renegotiate our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	12152	I don't think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	12153	But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners.	0
ClaimBuster	12154	But I'll try harder to keep it on a high plane.	0
ClaimBuster	12155	... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.	0
ClaimBuster	12156	They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.	1
ClaimBuster	12157	I'm an optimist, but we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	12158	- has to be taken by the Federal Government and when we took action, it had a favorable response.	0
ClaimBuster	12159	No, what I said was that, because we achieved such a rapid victory, more of the Saddam loyalists were around.	1
ClaimBuster	12160	But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.	0
ClaimBuster	12161	They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	12162	Well, as I've said, I am not an enemy of conservation.	0
ClaimBuster	12163	I've met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin places, Iowa, where they're going out on the Internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kids.	1
ClaimBuster	12164	Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	12165	Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action.	1
ClaimBuster	12166	And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we've already paid.	0
ClaimBuster	12167	Now, this is guy a who, along with others, has taken great risk for great freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	12168	Employment will be up, revenues will be up.	0
ClaimBuster	12169	It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific.	0
ClaimBuster	12170	And she was fiercely independent.	0
ClaimBuster	12171	And if you want to pay for the rest of his plan, all the other spending programs, you're going to sock it to the working man.	0
ClaimBuster	12172	We've got to reduce our deficit, but we've got to do it in a balanced way.	0
ClaimBuster	12173	And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.	0
ClaimBuster	12174	And, very simply, in the inner city, they're starved -- you see, small business is the way to jump start the inner city, not --	0
ClaimBuster	12175	That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.	0
ClaimBuster	12176	But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	12177	Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed.	0
ClaimBuster	12178	There's no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government.	0
ClaimBuster	12179	It's just not the way I think and it's not my intentions and not my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	12180	I happen to believe it is.	0
ClaimBuster	12181	Let me just say categorically I'm proud of the people that come to our rallies.	0
ClaimBuster	12182	When we say we're somebody's friend, everybody has got to believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	12183	We took care of the safety issues.	1
ClaimBuster	12184	I love America just as all of you love America.	0
ClaimBuster	12185	But you've also got to show that you are prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes.	0
ClaimBuster	12186	We've never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I don't think we should have a citizenship card today.	1
ClaimBuster	12187	When you're president you expect this.	0
ClaimBuster	12188	I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.	0
ClaimBuster	12189	Now, there was a second phase in the Iranian affair in which we had something to do with that.	1
ClaimBuster	12190	This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.	0
ClaimBuster	12191	I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.	0
ClaimBuster	12192	It's very important that we not just, without thinking it through, just rush to every problem in the world and have our people torn to pieces.	0
ClaimBuster	12193	That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	12194	And I'm not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries.	0
ClaimBuster	12195	And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	12196	We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	12197	In fact, I've said the opposite: I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation.	0
ClaimBuster	12198	President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.	1
ClaimBuster	12199	And that was -- that was -- that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	12200	As we have seen tonight, foreign policy and defense policy are difficult and complex issues.	0
ClaimBuster	12201	"This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ""You know, I alone can fix it,"" as he said on the convention stage."	1
ClaimBuster	12202	I don't believe the United States did that.	0
ClaimBuster	12203	We got rid of that; we've kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn't indicate that we're trigger-happy.	1
ClaimBuster	12204	This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II.	0
ClaimBuster	12205	I -- I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power.	1
ClaimBuster	12206	I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt.	0
ClaimBuster	12207	Young people with high grades can't get a job.	1
ClaimBuster	12208	And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's.	0
ClaimBuster	12209	If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you can't have medical care, or you're holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next?	0
ClaimBuster	12210	Mine has been in the executive branch.	1
ClaimBuster	12211	I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty.	1
ClaimBuster	12212	You want to buy into it, you can.	0
ClaimBuster	12213	And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	12214	But there's a larger law.	0
ClaimBuster	12215	It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	12216	And I didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.	0
ClaimBuster	12217	To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area.	0
ClaimBuster	12218	We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills.	0
ClaimBuster	12219	I also have had the opportunity of knowing and meeting other Communist leaders in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	12220	Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.	0
ClaimBuster	12221	That doesn't get the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	12222	The president sides with the power companies, the oil companies, the drug companies.	0
ClaimBuster	12223	We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.	1
ClaimBuster	12224	And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	12225	I don't want to be the world's policeman, I want to be the world's peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped.	0
ClaimBuster	12226	We have found also in our studies that in this increase in poverty, it all had to do with their private earnings.	1
ClaimBuster	12227	You have to decide whether you want to change or not.	0
ClaimBuster	12228	The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.	0
ClaimBuster	12229	Because we've had tough aggressive trade policies, and because we've got interest rates down.	1
ClaimBuster	12230	Our country is not strong anymore; we're not respected anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	12231	Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.	0
ClaimBuster	12232	The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	12233	I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility.	1
ClaimBuster	12234	And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.	0
ClaimBuster	12235	And that wasn't just about a problem between Georgia and Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	12236	I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.	1
ClaimBuster	12237	Let's not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	12238	And I think that we'll have good results uh - on November the second for myself and I hope for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	12239	And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years.	0
ClaimBuster	12240	Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have.	0
ClaimBuster	12241	And it's not only just America, but NATO is now helping, Jordan's helping train police, UAE is helping train police.	1
ClaimBuster	12242	It's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan.	1
ClaimBuster	12243	Now, some say, oh, you're a Republican, you can't be reaching out to these people.	0
ClaimBuster	12244	We cut the deficit by 60 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12245	Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?	0
ClaimBuster	12246	It's time to have a fresh start.	0
ClaimBuster	12247	Number three, stop the federal government's program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won't do the same thing for plants that stay here.	0
ClaimBuster	12248	And that certainly would not help us in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	12249	The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.	0
ClaimBuster	12250	Mr. Bush wants to spend billions on Star Wars.	0
ClaimBuster	12251	And, lastly, the other night on character Governor Clinton said it's not the character of the president but the character of the presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	12252	And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	12253	I say if Germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation, if Hawaii can cover 98% of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us, if Rochester, New York, can do it with two-thirds of the cost of the rest of it, America can do it, too.	1
ClaimBuster	12254	The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.	0
ClaimBuster	12255	Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.	1
ClaimBuster	12256	I tell you one thing I'm not going to do is I'm not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the world's air.	0
ClaimBuster	12257	Let me make one other suggestion, because you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.	0
ClaimBuster	12258	"Now, the president said, ""I'm not blocking that."""	1
ClaimBuster	12259	Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	12260	These are the great questions: equality of education in school.	0
ClaimBuster	12261	I have a plan for Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	12262	In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	12263	It's time to get something done.	0
ClaimBuster	12264	I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	12265	The president just said that government-run health care results in poor quality.	1
ClaimBuster	12266	I might go back to one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	12267	We have to have money to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	12268	Let me take just one question that he raises - the military strength and capability of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	12269	"And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, ""Is this true?"	0
ClaimBuster	12270	No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.	0
ClaimBuster	12271	His name is Randy Ellis.	1
ClaimBuster	12272	And when I am president, I'm going to do it because we have to.	0
ClaimBuster	12273	The uh - emphasis, I think, of the - of the court system uh - should be to interpret the uh - the Constitution and the laws uh - equally between property protection and personal protection.	0
ClaimBuster	12274	And the children get lost in the process.	0
ClaimBuster	12275	But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide.	0
ClaimBuster	12276	Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.	0
ClaimBuster	12277	Well, that's the only protection the taxpayer has against some of these reckless pork programs up there, and I'd rather be able to just line it right out of there and get on about passing some good stuff but leave out the garbage.	0
ClaimBuster	12278	I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first.	0
ClaimBuster	12279	We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained.	0
ClaimBuster	12280	But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that we're not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	12281	There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror.	1
ClaimBuster	12282	I'm against giving anybody any kind of preference for something they're not qualified for.	0
ClaimBuster	12283	So what did we do?	0
ClaimBuster	12284	First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins.	0
ClaimBuster	12285	And God bless the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	12286	My plan is not like anything that's been tried before.	1
ClaimBuster	12287	I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	12288	I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.	0
ClaimBuster	12289	And I have said again and again and again let's get off mud wrestling, let's get off personalities and let's talk about jobs, health care, crime, the things that concern the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	12290	I've said to the extent we spend federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning.	1
ClaimBuster	12291	We must never waver in the face of this enemy that -- these ideologues of hate.	0
ClaimBuster	12292	And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.	1
ClaimBuster	12293	America and the world are safer for it.	0
ClaimBuster	12294	Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.	1
ClaimBuster	12295	These people have all left.	1
ClaimBuster	12296	And the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you're paying at the pump.	0
ClaimBuster	12297	We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.	1
ClaimBuster	12298	You'd go broke in a hurry.	0
ClaimBuster	12299	It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	12300	And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules.	0
ClaimBuster	12301	That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.	0
ClaimBuster	12302	They're dying to get the commercial airline business.	0
ClaimBuster	12303	I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them.	0
ClaimBuster	12304	She did call it the gold standard.	1
ClaimBuster	12305	But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.	0
ClaimBuster	12306	That's another trillion dollars -- that's $8 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	12307	It's good to see you again, Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	12308	It's not going to cost the government money.	0
ClaimBuster	12309	They're half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they'll be a lot less.	1
ClaimBuster	12310	And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done.	0
ClaimBuster	12311	Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.	1
ClaimBuster	12312	We've had the lowest rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine months of any major industrialized society in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	12313	"To me that concept is completely repugnant."""	0
ClaimBuster	12314	I do strongly support the WIC program.	0
ClaimBuster	12315	But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.	0
ClaimBuster	12316	You are robbing the American people of their savings.	0
ClaimBuster	12317	And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.	1
ClaimBuster	12318	Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; he's been in politics for fifty years; he's been president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	12319	I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.	0
ClaimBuster	12320	A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law.	0
ClaimBuster	12321	Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	12322	We have gangs roaming the street.	1
ClaimBuster	12323	That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.	0
ClaimBuster	12324	We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.	0
ClaimBuster	12325	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.	0
ClaimBuster	12326	I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.	0
ClaimBuster	12327	If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.	0
ClaimBuster	12328	But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.	0
ClaimBuster	12329	That's not how we're going to move our economy forward.	0
ClaimBuster	12330	"Will you guys give us permission to shift it over into training?"""	0
ClaimBuster	12331	I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	12332	I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	12333	They're having a hard time making ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	12334	We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover.	1
ClaimBuster	12335	If you're a parent and you're struggling to get health insurance for your children, Senator Obama will fine you.	1
ClaimBuster	12336	Secondly -- and they're good.	0
ClaimBuster	12337	You've got to have world class teachers, world class books.	0
ClaimBuster	12338	Our military is second to none in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	12339	I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny.	0
ClaimBuster	12340	So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.	0
ClaimBuster	12341	But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.	0
ClaimBuster	12342	And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense.	1
ClaimBuster	12343	By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area.	1
ClaimBuster	12344	"First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, ""Don't put those troops there.''"	1
ClaimBuster	12345	I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development.	0
ClaimBuster	12346	The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are.	0
ClaimBuster	12347	We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work.	0
ClaimBuster	12348	I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program.	1
ClaimBuster	12349	And when you do that, you've have homeless families.	0
ClaimBuster	12350	I believe it was her campaign that did it.	0
ClaimBuster	12351	That's how much I care about it.	0
ClaimBuster	12352	I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.	0
ClaimBuster	12353	We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.	0
ClaimBuster	12354	I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals of historical perspective of his own party.	1
ClaimBuster	12355	The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.	0
ClaimBuster	12356	Now, I believe in community policing.	0
ClaimBuster	12357	Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low.	1
ClaimBuster	12358	We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.	0
ClaimBuster	12359	I believe those negotiations should continue.	0
ClaimBuster	12360	"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then."""	1
ClaimBuster	12361	The President wants to spend 20 percent more in the next six years, and I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people.	1
ClaimBuster	12362	And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.	0
ClaimBuster	12363	If you make more than $60,000 and up to 100 you'll still get a match, but not as generous.	1
ClaimBuster	12364	We've got to stop drifting.	0
ClaimBuster	12365	They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.	1
ClaimBuster	12366	But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.	0
ClaimBuster	12367	Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	12368	Which one of those promises will you keep and which will you break, Governor?	0
ClaimBuster	12369	If you want someone who will fight for you and who will fight for the middle-class families and working men and women, who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else, then I want to fight for you.	0
ClaimBuster	12370	The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there.	0
ClaimBuster	12371	We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way.	0
ClaimBuster	12372	The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	12373	But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.	1
ClaimBuster	12374	Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	12375	They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth.	0
ClaimBuster	12376	It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.	1
ClaimBuster	12377	And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's?	0
ClaimBuster	12378	In other words, we've got to be tough.	0
ClaimBuster	12379	This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.	1
ClaimBuster	12380	Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.	0
ClaimBuster	12381	First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time.	0
ClaimBuster	12382	In addition to that we've had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world.	0
ClaimBuster	12383	They'll do fine whether you're president or I am.	0
ClaimBuster	12384	It's an issue that good people obviously disagree on.	0
ClaimBuster	12385	Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense.	1
ClaimBuster	12386	The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.	1
ClaimBuster	12387	We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.	0
ClaimBuster	12388	It's stuck in the Senate, because the trial lawyers won't act on it.	1
ClaimBuster	12389	And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	12390	Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives.	1
ClaimBuster	12391	Well, I'll -- I'll be very quick.	0
ClaimBuster	12392	I have actually not questioned Governor Bush's experience.	1
ClaimBuster	12393	Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.	0
ClaimBuster	12394	If you look at the history of a lower court judge's rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how they'll interpret questions.	0
ClaimBuster	12395	And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up.	1
ClaimBuster	12396	And so I refuse to measure one's commitment as to whether you're going to double the spending.	0
ClaimBuster	12397	The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	12398	Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package.	1
ClaimBuster	12399	And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror.	0
ClaimBuster	12400	So I'd get rid of that one from day one.	0
ClaimBuster	12401	And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.	0
ClaimBuster	12402	"So you say, ""Was it worth it?"""	0
ClaimBuster	12403	And so it isn't one and state governments have had a tough time.	0
ClaimBuster	12404	And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.	0
ClaimBuster	12405	And that's what needs to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	12406	I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	12407	They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.	1
ClaimBuster	12408	They're good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	12409	But what I'm not for what I'm not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does.	0
ClaimBuster	12410	But I think that's the American way.	0
ClaimBuster	12411	There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953.	1
ClaimBuster	12412	They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there.	1
ClaimBuster	12413	Look, our country is stagnant.	0
ClaimBuster	12414	He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.	1
ClaimBuster	12415	And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but you've got to, as president, you can't be on all these different sides, and you can't have this pattern of saying well, I did this or I didn't, then the facts come out and you change it.	0
ClaimBuster	12416	I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard.	0
ClaimBuster	12417	I supported that route for some time and again I think it gets back to experience.	0
ClaimBuster	12418	I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	12419	In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.	1
ClaimBuster	12420	I am not talking of scrapping.	0
ClaimBuster	12421	We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	12422	And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan.	1
ClaimBuster	12423	We've got to make sure that works properly.	0
ClaimBuster	12424	And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met.	1
ClaimBuster	12425	I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first.	0
ClaimBuster	12426	That's why I said tonight I'm for opportunity, responsibility and community.	0
ClaimBuster	12427	We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through.	0
ClaimBuster	12428	Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.	1
ClaimBuster	12429	And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.	1
ClaimBuster	12430	I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea.	0
ClaimBuster	12431	And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.	0
ClaimBuster	12432	I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	12433	Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.	1
ClaimBuster	12434	You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up.	0
ClaimBuster	12435	I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	12436	That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.	0
ClaimBuster	12437	I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair.	0
ClaimBuster	12438	As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.	1
ClaimBuster	12439	"But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, ""We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby."""	0
ClaimBuster	12440	But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.	0
ClaimBuster	12441	I'm not going to be a picker and chooser.	0
ClaimBuster	12442	I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America.	0
ClaimBuster	12443	It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade.	0
ClaimBuster	12444	Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.	0
ClaimBuster	12445	Pretty simply, who's the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs?	0
ClaimBuster	12446	You ought to make more decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	12447	One way, for instance, would be to have a single number.	0
ClaimBuster	12448	But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.	1
ClaimBuster	12449	And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	12450	It would borrow up to $3 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	12451	The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.	0
ClaimBuster	12452	It turned out to be a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	12453	Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.	0
ClaimBuster	12454	When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.	0
ClaimBuster	12455	And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow.	0
ClaimBuster	12456	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.	1
ClaimBuster	12457	And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.	1
ClaimBuster	12458	As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	12459	"The head of the EPA said, ""You can't build a coal plant."	1
ClaimBuster	12460	And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task.	0
ClaimBuster	12461	And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion.	1
ClaimBuster	12462	In addition to that, we're going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.	1
ClaimBuster	12463	For the last two years, I've been the president, and I have found from experience that it's much more difficult to make those decisions than it is to second-guess them.	1
ClaimBuster	12464	The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have.	1
ClaimBuster	12465	Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes?	0
ClaimBuster	12466	Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.	1
ClaimBuster	12467	But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful, in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Hussein's threatened invasion of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	12468	But that was something that happened.	1
ClaimBuster	12469	I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.	1
ClaimBuster	12470	Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.	1
ClaimBuster	12471	It's because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there.	0
ClaimBuster	12472	They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis.	0
ClaimBuster	12473	"This president in the last debate said, ""Well, that would be a big tax gap if we did that."""	1
ClaimBuster	12474	We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country.	1
ClaimBuster	12475	And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.	1
ClaimBuster	12476	And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.	0
ClaimBuster	12477	So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.	0
ClaimBuster	12478	And it requires a president who is steadfast and strong and determined.	0
ClaimBuster	12479	I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	12480	Let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	12481	So strong economy is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	12482	He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.	0
ClaimBuster	12483	And not legislating from the bench.	0
ClaimBuster	12484	You know, I'd been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I answered them as well as I could have.	1
ClaimBuster	12485	Mr. Hankins, I don't feel good about it, and I think we ought to have a patient's bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the HMOs and give them back to the doctors and nurses.	0
ClaimBuster	12486	There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.	1
ClaimBuster	12487	Have you noticed, they've been in charge the last two years.	1
ClaimBuster	12488	There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.	0
ClaimBuster	12489	The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.	1
ClaimBuster	12490	Tell Tony Blair we're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	12491	It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue.	0
ClaimBuster	12492	But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society.	0
ClaimBuster	12493	They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.	0
ClaimBuster	12494	Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	12495	You say who's making these deals?	0
ClaimBuster	12496	And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War.	1
ClaimBuster	12497	Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public.	0
ClaimBuster	12498	And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	12499	You see that every night on television.	0
ClaimBuster	12500	They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time.	1
ClaimBuster	12501	You're supposed to have a government that comes from you.	0
ClaimBuster	12502	Well, bringing people together, again, is obviously a responsibility we all have.	0
ClaimBuster	12503	Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps.	0
ClaimBuster	12504	And therein, I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle down, trickle down, and he's still talking about spending more and taxing more.	0
ClaimBuster	12505	But uh - Mr. Burns uh - in that respect made a very serious mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	12506	I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	12507	It is that we are continuing to spend too much.	0
ClaimBuster	12508	As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that's where it will end.	1
ClaimBuster	12509	And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	12510	We still have lots of troops in Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	12511	The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	12512	And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.	0
ClaimBuster	12513	In my economic plan we increase it 39percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12514	She wants to fight for rebels.	1
ClaimBuster	12515	You've had your chance and it didn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	12516	And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them.	0
ClaimBuster	12517	But let me -- let me not just stop there.	0
ClaimBuster	12518	For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire.	0
ClaimBuster	12519	The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi.	1
ClaimBuster	12520	And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	12521	Isn't it time to stop creating images?	0
ClaimBuster	12522	And you see, yes, my position has evolved.	0
ClaimBuster	12523	We're America, and we believe in our future and we know we have the ability to shape our future.	0
ClaimBuster	12524	this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today.	1
ClaimBuster	12525	See, our differences are our strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	12526	If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit.	0
ClaimBuster	12527	The net result is uh - we think under Carla Hills, who's the chairman of my uh - urban development and uh - neighborhood revitalization program, we will really do a first-class job in helping uh - the communities throughout the country.	1
ClaimBuster	12528	And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.	0
ClaimBuster	12529	I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.	0
ClaimBuster	12530	I'd like to thank the people who've started with Mr. Perot who've come on to help our campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	12531	First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party.	1
ClaimBuster	12532	First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks.	0
ClaimBuster	12533	And I try not to.	0
ClaimBuster	12534	I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation -- habeas corpus reform, so you don't have these endless appeals, so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real.	1
ClaimBuster	12535	Then when they get off by themselves, they say nobody did it.	0
ClaimBuster	12536	How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?	0
ClaimBuster	12537	The terrorists have won each time.	0
ClaimBuster	12538	I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.	0
ClaimBuster	12539	When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.	1
ClaimBuster	12540	One of the reasons is we almost had it done, and the speaker -- a very, able, decent fellow, I might add -- but he twisted the arms of some of the sponsors of that legislation and had them change their vote.	1
ClaimBuster	12541	And you bet we're gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today.	1
ClaimBuster	12542	I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them.	1
ClaimBuster	12543	Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	12544	The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life.	0
ClaimBuster	12545	And I said it numerous times.	1
ClaimBuster	12546	And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.	1
ClaimBuster	12547	Those are my best ideas about it.	0
ClaimBuster	12548	Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust.	1
ClaimBuster	12549	... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...	1
ClaimBuster	12550	If it's a failing school, shut it down and reopen it under a new principal with a turnaround team of specialists the way Governor Jim Hunt does in North Carolina.	1
ClaimBuster	12551	I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project that's reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years.	1
ClaimBuster	12552	I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side.	0
ClaimBuster	12553	Well, thank you again, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	12554	Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.	1
ClaimBuster	12555	And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate.	1
ClaimBuster	12556	Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this.	0
ClaimBuster	12557	And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	12558	Mr. Nixon knows very well that in this - in this whole matter that's been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, I've never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it.	1
ClaimBuster	12559	And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible.	0
ClaimBuster	12560	You implement that NAFTA, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people a dollar an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and you're going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order.	1
ClaimBuster	12561	We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.	0
ClaimBuster	12562	It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.	1
ClaimBuster	12563	Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	12564	The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.	0
ClaimBuster	12565	And our alliance is strong.	0
ClaimBuster	12566	Our policies are very different.	0
ClaimBuster	12567	Let me just -- I've got to answer this.	0
ClaimBuster	12568	Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy.	1
ClaimBuster	12569	He indicates he would not make those.	0
ClaimBuster	12570	If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for a factory worker, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire a young -- let's assume you've been in business for a long time.	0
ClaimBuster	12571	You're spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	12572	But I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	12573	And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	12574	In the two-hundred-year history there's been a very uh - cautious approach to this.	0
ClaimBuster	12575	I don't agree with that statement.	0
ClaimBuster	12576	And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?	0
ClaimBuster	12577	Let's take the example of Darfur just for a moment.	0
ClaimBuster	12578	Good, I look forward to it.	0
ClaimBuster	12579	What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	12580	There wouldn't be time for a President to decide; it would be decided by these remote computers.	0
ClaimBuster	12581	I reject this notion -- and I'm suggesting my opponent isn't -- I reject the notion that some say that if you're Muslim you can't free, you don't desire freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	12582	Decide who you think will do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	12583	And we control private and public health care costs.	1
ClaimBuster	12584	Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports.	0
ClaimBuster	12585	Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still.	0
ClaimBuster	12586	That has to be our biggest national security priority.	0
ClaimBuster	12587	We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids.	0
ClaimBuster	12588	We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today.	1
ClaimBuster	12589	I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality.	0
ClaimBuster	12590	A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy.	0
ClaimBuster	12591	But back then we had planes that couldn't fly for lack of spare parts or pilots.	1
ClaimBuster	12592	He says he's going to give you tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	12593	And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.	1
ClaimBuster	12594	He voted against these programs, he does not believe it.	1
ClaimBuster	12595	She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.	1
ClaimBuster	12596	The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.	0
ClaimBuster	12597	You know, last year up to this time, we've lost 700,000 jobs in America.	1
ClaimBuster	12598	So I favor closing the gun show loophole.	0
ClaimBuster	12599	I've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war.	1
ClaimBuster	12600	It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	12601	I was against the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	12602	I do not agree with that point of view.	0
ClaimBuster	12603	We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.	1
ClaimBuster	12604	It has doubled over the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	12605	Well, look at the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	12606	What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesn't understand what I'm talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	12607	I remember driving down the California coast one day.	0
ClaimBuster	12608	When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.	0
ClaimBuster	12609	Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.	0
ClaimBuster	12610	Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe.	1
ClaimBuster	12611	And people are beginning to educate through this program, teaching these kids you shouldn't use drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	12612	Well can I have the last word on this?	0
ClaimBuster	12613	The president reversed it publicly while the president of South Korea was here.	1
ClaimBuster	12614	I am simply saying that I believe that that's where the effort should be directed -- to make that determination.	0
ClaimBuster	12615	Now, we have come back from that abyss.	1
ClaimBuster	12616	Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse.	0
ClaimBuster	12617	The governor talked about Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	12618	I notice you bring that up a lot.	1
ClaimBuster	12619	It's one of the best schools in Houston.	1
ClaimBuster	12620	And we've cut them 18 times.	1
ClaimBuster	12621	But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.	1
ClaimBuster	12622	And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that we're going to have to do something about home values.	0
ClaimBuster	12623	Well, I think age is very -- you know, wisdom comes from age, experience and intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	12624	You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	12625	They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.	1
ClaimBuster	12626	If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money.	0
ClaimBuster	12627	You even brought some right-wing congressman into the White House to plot how to attack me for going to Russia in 1969-70, when over 50,000 other Americans did.	1
ClaimBuster	12628	And it's going to be tough.	0
ClaimBuster	12629	He's going to do -- and he would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	0
ClaimBuster	12630	But we have an employer-based system.	0
ClaimBuster	12631	John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.	0
ClaimBuster	12632	Now, we have a choice here.	0
ClaimBuster	12633	I don't think in racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that.	0
ClaimBuster	12634	For the first four years -- it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered.	1
ClaimBuster	12635	And the reason it's that important is that all of the other issues, whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patient's bill of rights to take the decisions away from the HMOs and give them to the doctors and nurses, opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies, all these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	12636	We've got to put our house in order.	0
ClaimBuster	12637	And they'll gridlock right at that point because for example, we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply -- you see, if it was a 2-way street, just couldn't do it.	1
ClaimBuster	12638	Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.	1
ClaimBuster	12639	The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans.	1
ClaimBuster	12640	It's about where we are now.	0
ClaimBuster	12641	That's Social Security and Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	12642	And you ought to have some of this surplus so you can save and dream and build.	0
ClaimBuster	12643	I don't believe that the Rumanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	12644	And what's happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly.	1
ClaimBuster	12645	I have had a chance to work with him and Alan Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso.	1
ClaimBuster	12646	We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties.	0
ClaimBuster	12647	If you change your job, you're going to be covered.	1
ClaimBuster	12648	So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	12649	And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.	0
ClaimBuster	12650	The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	12651	I have a plan to let you buy into the same health care senators and congressmen give themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	12652	And I will address you as Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	12653	We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community.	1
ClaimBuster	12654	We can't get involved in the quagmire, but we must do what we can.	0
ClaimBuster	12655	And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.	0
ClaimBuster	12656	This is an arms escalation.	0
ClaimBuster	12657	I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.	1
ClaimBuster	12658	And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12659	... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America.	1
ClaimBuster	12660	The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.	1
ClaimBuster	12661	And when the Vice President talks about liberals on the Bench, I wonder who he's talking about?	0
ClaimBuster	12662	We need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	12663	They're all patriots but you've got to link arms and work with them.	0
ClaimBuster	12664	Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	12665	I agree with everything she said.	0
ClaimBuster	12666	And I don't believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews.	0
ClaimBuster	12667	You don't guarantee they get the job.	0
ClaimBuster	12668	I didn't hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	12669	I just have to say something.	0
ClaimBuster	12670	I was an altar boy.	1
ClaimBuster	12671	And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	12672	Now, you've got to have a government that comes from you again.	0
ClaimBuster	12673	I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	12674	And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	12675	He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year.	1
ClaimBuster	12676	The military will be an all-volunteer army.	0
ClaimBuster	12677	My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	12678	We do need tougher sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	12679	We ought to pursue strategies with each of them, economic and the rest, that help them pull away from their dependence upon the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	12680	They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.	1
ClaimBuster	12681	Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal.	0
ClaimBuster	12682	I don't have a free reserved parking place at Natl Airport, why should my servants?	1
ClaimBuster	12683	The Oregon plan made some good sense, but it's easy to dismiss the concerns of the disabled.	0
ClaimBuster	12684	My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it.	0
ClaimBuster	12685	Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don't wind up in Europe and Asia.	0
ClaimBuster	12686	... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.	0
ClaimBuster	12687	More and more women are being elected.	1
ClaimBuster	12688	I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild.	0
ClaimBuster	12689	This is a deviation from idealism; it's a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it's a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it's also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately.	0
ClaimBuster	12690	Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesn't believe we can succeed and with somebody who says that war where we are is a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	12691	So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	12692	And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.	1
ClaimBuster	12693	And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.	0
ClaimBuster	12694	There is much to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	12695	And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.	0
ClaimBuster	12696	I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.	0
ClaimBuster	12697	And I think immediately following the Republican Convention, there was about a ten-point spread.	1
ClaimBuster	12698	No, no, I had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?	0
ClaimBuster	12699	I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	12700	I appreciate that very much.	0
ClaimBuster	12701	It doesn't accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor.	1
ClaimBuster	12702	Uh - a job, a home for all those that'll work and save for it, uh - safety in the streets, uh - health that is a - health care that is affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	12703	Since I've got about 20 seconds, let me just say one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	12704	We hear all the negatives.	0
ClaimBuster	12705	They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity.	1
ClaimBuster	12706	What it says is that gays and lesbians can't be fired from their job because they're gay or lesbian.	1
ClaimBuster	12707	That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.	0
ClaimBuster	12708	We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	12709	And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded.	0
ClaimBuster	12710	There's even an Apple store in China that's a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods.	1
ClaimBuster	12711	I spent my life in the private sector, not in government.	1
ClaimBuster	12712	And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.	0
ClaimBuster	12713	And it's not just about women.	0
ClaimBuster	12714	I think we have a real obligation, obviously public officials.	0
ClaimBuster	12715	There are hundreds of thousands of them.	1
ClaimBuster	12716	What about the prices you pay?	0
ClaimBuster	12717	Once it's a drug, does it apply only to teenagers or everybody in America?	0
ClaimBuster	12718	I think that we do.	0
ClaimBuster	12719	Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful.	0
ClaimBuster	12720	I would have to see what they wanted to do, but I don't believe that will be the request.	0
ClaimBuster	12721	We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.	0
ClaimBuster	12722	We had 25 fighter wings.	1
ClaimBuster	12723	What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12724	It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	12725	And we're all proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	12726	Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.	0
ClaimBuster	12727	We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.	0
ClaimBuster	12728	I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.	0
ClaimBuster	12729	Osama bin Laden attacked us.	1
ClaimBuster	12730	If you think that was good, then you do.	0
ClaimBuster	12731	He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get.	0
ClaimBuster	12732	I know that we can grow manufacturing jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	12733	And my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	12734	And all that raises revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	12735	Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more -- is peaceful.	0
ClaimBuster	12736	And he is leaving office with a popularity at an all-time high, because American people	1
ClaimBuster	12737	I have no intention of wilting.	0
ClaimBuster	12738	They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.	0
ClaimBuster	12739	So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it would've interfered with our energy independence program.	1
ClaimBuster	12740	They're suffering in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	12741	They're tomorrow's industries in the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	12742	And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.	0
ClaimBuster	12743	I'm asking for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	12744	It's time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism.	0
ClaimBuster	12745	The administration deserves credit for having made it work.	0
ClaimBuster	12746	The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they're found.	0
ClaimBuster	12747	He testified, and these are his words - the present governor of Georgia - he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles.	1
ClaimBuster	12748	I shouldn't have a preference.	0
ClaimBuster	12749	That's not what I think.	0
ClaimBuster	12750	But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he's been supported by most military authority, these islands that we're now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment.	1
ClaimBuster	12751	But -- OK. All right.	0
ClaimBuster	12752	I'm shocked to hear that.	0
ClaimBuster	12753	And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	12754	And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	12755	I think it is respecting life to reach for that cure.	0
ClaimBuster	12756	But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.	0
ClaimBuster	12757	Why not try to help them with my small business program to build some incentives into the system?	0
ClaimBuster	12758	I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun.	0
ClaimBuster	12759	Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you.	0
ClaimBuster	12760	He was hoping we'd turn away.	0
ClaimBuster	12761	I started doing these formats a year ago in New Hampshire and I found that we had huge crowds because all I did was let people ask questions and I tried to give very specific answers.	1
ClaimBuster	12762	Because you know, in the first debate, Mr. Bush made some news.	1
ClaimBuster	12763	There are inspections that are very intrusive.	0
ClaimBuster	12764	Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.	1
ClaimBuster	12765	He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois.	1
ClaimBuster	12766	There are certainly dangers there, there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the US.	0
ClaimBuster	12767	For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.	1
ClaimBuster	12768	It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.	0
ClaimBuster	12769	The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead.	0
ClaimBuster	12770	And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.	0
ClaimBuster	12771	And what was the cost?	0
ClaimBuster	12772	You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.	0
ClaimBuster	12773	I don't intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we're negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort.	0
ClaimBuster	12774	He believes in nation building.	0
ClaimBuster	12775	The killing and tragedies had taken place.	1
ClaimBuster	12776	It's not an accurate one at all.	0
ClaimBuster	12777	We don't have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	12778	I'm not proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	12779	Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	12780	We want to work with the Russians.	0
ClaimBuster	12781	If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority.	0
ClaimBuster	12782	When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12783	Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation.	0
ClaimBuster	12784	We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.	0
ClaimBuster	12785	One thing about insurance, that's a Washington term.	0
ClaimBuster	12786	Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret - in secret treaties that've been uh - pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	12787	It's not going to happen overnight; it certainly will have to happen on a step-by-step basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction.	0
ClaimBuster	12788	You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.	1
ClaimBuster	12789	I've got three part- time jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	12790	I'm not talking about leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	12791	So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.	0
ClaimBuster	12792	Start asking the question, what do you know?	0
ClaimBuster	12793	I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.	0
ClaimBuster	12794	We're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	12795	It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not.	1
ClaimBuster	12796	The president's characterization of my tax plan...	0
ClaimBuster	12797	And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	12798	I said many foolish things back in those days.	0
ClaimBuster	12799	Let me say in my case, if I'm out of work, I'll cut grass tomorrow to take care of my family; I'll be happy to make shoes, I'll be happy to make clothing, I'll make sausage.	0
ClaimBuster	12800	As a matter of fact, that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh - the weeks ahead.	1
ClaimBuster	12801	I don't believe that our relative strength is increasing.	0
ClaimBuster	12802	Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.	0
ClaimBuster	12803	Under Vice President Gore's plan, they get $145 of tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	12804	Go back to work at 30,000 bucks a month representing some other country.	0
ClaimBuster	12805	I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	12806	And I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it.	1
ClaimBuster	12807	Now, we're sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability.	0
ClaimBuster	12808	And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	12809	The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with.	0
ClaimBuster	12810	In fact, he went on to say... WALLACE: Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes.	0
ClaimBuster	12811	And I'm looking forward to having that debate.	0
ClaimBuster	12812	And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	12813	Well, the red light went on.	0
ClaimBuster	12814	I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure.	0
ClaimBuster	12815	Mr. Bush is trying to run against Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter and everybody in the world but me in this race.	0
ClaimBuster	12816	Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.	1
ClaimBuster	12817	Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	12818	I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.	1
ClaimBuster	12819	We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level.	0
ClaimBuster	12820	And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.	0
ClaimBuster	12821	There are three fundamental challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	12822	And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12823	If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules.	0
ClaimBuster	12824	The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	12825	I have been in the cabinet.	1
ClaimBuster	12826	I've never wilted in my life.	1
ClaimBuster	12827	But we're not there yet.	0
ClaimBuster	12828	We had a difference on the timetable.	1
ClaimBuster	12829	I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure.	0
ClaimBuster	12830	I've gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and month.	0
ClaimBuster	12831	But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.	0
ClaimBuster	12832	They sacrifice, they give everything for America.	0
ClaimBuster	12833	Already many people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say they've never seen before in their lifetimes.	1
ClaimBuster	12834	That's the plan for victory.	0
ClaimBuster	12835	It can't get any worse.	0
ClaimBuster	12836	We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.	0
ClaimBuster	12837	In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.	0
ClaimBuster	12838	All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools.	1
ClaimBuster	12839	I know that's a controversial view, but I do believe it's a deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	12840	I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.	1
ClaimBuster	12841	We can give you all these numbers, they don't mean a thing.	0
ClaimBuster	12842	And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war.	0
ClaimBuster	12843	I don't care what it is -- competitiveness, health care, crime, you name it.	0
ClaimBuster	12844	I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom.	0
ClaimBuster	12845	But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.	0
ClaimBuster	12846	I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	12847	You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.	0
ClaimBuster	12848	We should come to its defense.	0
ClaimBuster	12849	60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied handguns.	1
ClaimBuster	12850	I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.	0
ClaimBuster	12851	This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it.	0
ClaimBuster	12852	I believe they want to.	0
ClaimBuster	12853	Proud that they voted for the right candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	12854	We've had a 25% reduction since the first year I was in office.	1
ClaimBuster	12855	This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now they've reconstituted themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	12856	The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built.	1
ClaimBuster	12857	Isn't the real question is will we be better off?	0
ClaimBuster	12858	We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.	1
ClaimBuster	12859	And we're retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.	1
ClaimBuster	12860	We could have done that in Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	12861	I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust.	0
ClaimBuster	12862	Well, let's look at the president's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out.	0
ClaimBuster	12863	And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	12864	I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	12865	Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬•Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place.√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬§ He hasn't told us where.	1
ClaimBuster	12866	We have to bring back our workers.	0
ClaimBuster	12867	And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that.	0
ClaimBuster	12868	We're providing that young woman with help.	0
ClaimBuster	12869	If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.	0
ClaimBuster	12870	In the hands of a terrorist enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	12871	I think this is a great example.	0
ClaimBuster	12872	Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s and beyond.	0
ClaimBuster	12873	But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	12874	We're going to tell you how to do it all.	0
ClaimBuster	12875	I accept his objective and his dream; we all do.	0
ClaimBuster	12876	Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?	1
ClaimBuster	12877	I will balance the budget every year.	0
ClaimBuster	12878	There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.	0
ClaimBuster	12879	It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.	1
ClaimBuster	12880	Well, the people need it, that's the point.	0
ClaimBuster	12881	The one thing I'm for is a safe society.	0
ClaimBuster	12882	They don't want us talking about each other.	0
ClaimBuster	12883	Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?	0
ClaimBuster	12884	And what I'm concerned about is that if we continue with the policies that Mr. Bush is talking about here this evening, the flexible freeze somebody described it the other day as a kind of economic slurpee he wants to spend billions on virtually every weapons system around.	0
ClaimBuster	12885	That's no way to treat somebody who's courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward.	0
ClaimBuster	12886	The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education.	0
ClaimBuster	12887	But the exciting thing is, the fear of nuclear war is down.	0
ClaimBuster	12888	And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	12889	I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy.	0
ClaimBuster	12890	You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn't sit around.	1
ClaimBuster	12891	That's the analysis of economists who have looked at this.	1
ClaimBuster	12892	Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	12893	It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	12894	With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America.	0
ClaimBuster	12895	I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	12896	I believe in the transformational power of liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	12897	If affirmative action means quotas, I'm against it.	0
ClaimBuster	12898	I have a winning temperament.	0
ClaimBuster	12899	That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re-enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed.	1
ClaimBuster	12900	The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.	1
ClaimBuster	12901	And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car.	0
ClaimBuster	12902	But let me start with what you said.	0
ClaimBuster	12903	... the long-term health care drivers.	0
ClaimBuster	12904	So these are three programs which are quite moderate.	0
ClaimBuster	12905	It was President Bush that wrote the first checks.	1
ClaimBuster	12906	So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	12907	You don't say that out loud.	0
ClaimBuster	12908	And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	12909	That is a very serious charge against the president.	0
ClaimBuster	12910	Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.	1
ClaimBuster	12911	And so I just feel this is where I'm coming from.	0
ClaimBuster	12912	But again, the test or the difference between us, the president has had four years to try to do something about it, and North Korea has got more weapons; Iran is moving towards weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	12913	And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now.	0
ClaimBuster	12914	And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.	0
ClaimBuster	12915	We're going to tax -- cut taxes and balance the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	12916	The other night Governor Clinton raised my -- I don't know if you saw the debate the other night.	0
ClaimBuster	12917	He talks about all the jobs he's created in one or 2 years.	1
ClaimBuster	12918	Well, no, but the point is that's a subjective thing.	0
ClaimBuster	12919	And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department.	1
ClaimBuster	12920	So she wants to fight.	0
ClaimBuster	12921	Canada's tax rate on companies is now 15 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	12922	Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much.	0
ClaimBuster	12923	And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.	1
ClaimBuster	12924	And when we do things like that -- when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton (ph) that we did not forget her father.	0
ClaimBuster	12925	Is that the way it works?	0
ClaimBuster	12926	I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can't keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	12927	He -- he aligned with Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	12928	Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.	1
ClaimBuster	12929	It is new and it is very very different than what's happened, but it's not quite ready to be totally implemented.	0
ClaimBuster	12930	Government always needs the money it gets.	0
ClaimBuster	12931	And I think it's very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good.	0
ClaimBuster	12932	But you've been -- but you've been president four years...	1
ClaimBuster	12933	Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	12934	I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive.	0
ClaimBuster	12935	Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	12936	That's an example of an unfair burden sharing.	0
ClaimBuster	12937	On a per-person basis, it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs.	1
ClaimBuster	12938	My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	12939	So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	12940	Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think -- make all schools better.	0
ClaimBuster	12941	Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	12942	My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson's program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history.	1
ClaimBuster	12943	Would we be better off as I believe, working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, you're on your own?	0
ClaimBuster	12944	I got him to give the birth certificate.	1
ClaimBuster	12945	Well, I think it starts with Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	12946	And if we lose our will, we lose.	0
ClaimBuster	12947	We're on a different system.	1
ClaimBuster	12948	We will not have open borders.	0
ClaimBuster	12949	And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations.	0
ClaimBuster	12950	Four years ago I ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration.	1
ClaimBuster	12951	We want to be stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	12952	I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.	1
ClaimBuster	12953	I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.	0
ClaimBuster	12954	And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% - and I happen to think that's a very modest estimate - 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time.	1
ClaimBuster	12955	We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	12956	I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	12957	He didn't tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy.	1
ClaimBuster	12958	I've been in politics a long time, and I don't remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed.	0
ClaimBuster	12959	And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	12960	I'll stand on my record on that.	0
ClaimBuster	12961	I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	12962	This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.	0
ClaimBuster	12963	We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	12964	I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.	0
ClaimBuster	12965	The Philippines -- we've got help -- we're helping them there to bring -- to bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there.	1
ClaimBuster	12966	And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.	0
ClaimBuster	12967	The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	12968	... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...	0
ClaimBuster	12969	And you do have experience.	0
ClaimBuster	12970	It's a strategy that will succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	12971	And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.	1
ClaimBuster	12972	The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.	1
ClaimBuster	12973	And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits...	0
ClaimBuster	12974	And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri.	1
ClaimBuster	12975	Thank you, and good night.	0
ClaimBuster	12976	And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated.	0
ClaimBuster	12977	On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it's my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program.	1
ClaimBuster	12978	That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.	0
ClaimBuster	12979	Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky.	0
ClaimBuster	12980	I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	12981	Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.	1
ClaimBuster	12982	It's an election about the course of America.	0
ClaimBuster	12983	But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself.	1
ClaimBuster	12984	He should have produced it a long time before.	0
ClaimBuster	12985	In 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century.	1
ClaimBuster	12986	There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	12987	Well, Sander, that's a good question, and the answer is: for 40-some years we kept the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	12988	Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	12989	And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.	1
ClaimBuster	12990	We'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	12991	They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.	0
ClaimBuster	12992	But I respect the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	12993	My intentions are to earn your vote and earn your confidence.	0
ClaimBuster	12994	That, in my view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.	0
ClaimBuster	12995	And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.	1
ClaimBuster	12996	I don't think they ought to be held guilty.	0
ClaimBuster	12997	Highest private home ownership ever, but I'll make you one promise here.	1
ClaimBuster	12998	It's mortgaging our children's future.	0
ClaimBuster	12999	"Do you have what it takes?"""	0
ClaimBuster	13000	Well, wait, but it's very important.	0
ClaimBuster	13001	Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	13002	To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength.	0
ClaimBuster	13003	Mr. Mondale, I'm going to hang in there.	0
ClaimBuster	13004	I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS.	0
ClaimBuster	13005	Will the Congo go Communist?	0
ClaimBuster	13006	I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for four ears and not one single state - and most f them have a majority of Democratic legislators - has added to the ratification r voted to ratify the equal rights amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	13007	We're going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board.	1
ClaimBuster	13008	But we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	13009	We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	13010	Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace.	0
ClaimBuster	13011	No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.	1
ClaimBuster	13012	We have gone from a triple-dip recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling of the stock market.	1
ClaimBuster	13013	And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.	0
ClaimBuster	13014	Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.	1
ClaimBuster	13015	$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.	1
ClaimBuster	13016	I've been President now for almost four years.	1
ClaimBuster	13017	Maybe I'm missing something here.	0
ClaimBuster	13018	The Natl Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I've appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me.	1
ClaimBuster	13019	Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...	1
ClaimBuster	13020	And we are winning in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	13021	We knew he hated us.	0
ClaimBuster	13022	But let me just say the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals.	1
ClaimBuster	13023	And I did stop them, I admit that.	1
ClaimBuster	13024	I think Congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them.	0
ClaimBuster	13025	And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.	1
ClaimBuster	13026	During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules.	1
ClaimBuster	13027	We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...	1
ClaimBuster	13028	We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates -- who remembers that?	0
ClaimBuster	13029	He says he's not going to raise taxes, though he has broken that pledge repeatedly.	1
ClaimBuster	13030	I think we ought to get at it.	0
ClaimBuster	13031	How do we protect our people?	0
ClaimBuster	13032	You know, she's given it to us.	0
ClaimBuster	13033	Most Americans believe in basic values.	0
ClaimBuster	13034	The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.	1
ClaimBuster	13035	I think it's been a very constructive debate and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	13036	That wouldn't have stopped if we hadn't been willing wouldn't have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadn't even been willing to support the freedom fighters there.	0
ClaimBuster	13037	I think it's worth it, because I think -- I know in the long term a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, will set such a powerful example in a part of the world that's desperate for freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	13038	I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.	0
ClaimBuster	13039	But everybody's affected by the debt because of the tremendous interest that goes into paying on that debt everything's more expensive.	0
ClaimBuster	13040	And we believe China can be a partner, but we're also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there.	0
ClaimBuster	13041	This was the president's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	13042	And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general.	0
ClaimBuster	13043	Somebody, you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else.	0
ClaimBuster	13044	We love you, and we're grateful to you for everything that you've given to us.	0
ClaimBuster	13045	It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one.	0
ClaimBuster	13046	This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy.	0
ClaimBuster	13047	Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust.	0
ClaimBuster	13048	And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed.	0
ClaimBuster	13049	There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care.	0
ClaimBuster	13050	Number two, change the tax code.	0
ClaimBuster	13051	As to Ferdinand Marcos, he isn't there any more.	1
ClaimBuster	13052	When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.	0
ClaimBuster	13053	The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy.	0
ClaimBuster	13054	Why do I take it now?	0
ClaimBuster	13055	The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.	1
ClaimBuster	13056	Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.	1
ClaimBuster	13057	Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	13058	I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	13059	And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	13060	But that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it.	0
ClaimBuster	13061	I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.	0
ClaimBuster	13062	I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	13063	It always works that way.	0
ClaimBuster	13064	In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	13065	I guess it's because you will lose your right to tell them what to think.	0
ClaimBuster	13066	And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	13067	A free Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror, and that's essential.	0
ClaimBuster	13068	But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.	1
ClaimBuster	13069	I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.	0
ClaimBuster	13070	He came here for a reason, to tout our record on health in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	13071	After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.	1
ClaimBuster	13072	Your targeted tax cut, Mr. President, never hits anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	13073	He wants to give you sort of a government tax cut, which really doesn't mean anything.	0
ClaimBuster	13074	Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.	0
ClaimBuster	13075	And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender.	0
ClaimBuster	13076	Even though it's true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day.	1
ClaimBuster	13077	I don't believe legalizing narcotics is the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	13078	We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials.	0
ClaimBuster	13079	One other point I would make: what could you do?	0
ClaimBuster	13080	But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully.	0
ClaimBuster	13081	I was given the briefing and told that any time, night or day, I might be called upon to make the most fateful decision on Earth -- whether to fire these atomic weapons that could destroy the human species.	1
ClaimBuster	13082	I also will not add a penny to the debt.	0
ClaimBuster	13083	I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.	0
ClaimBuster	13084	Makes you feel real good to hear that, right?	0
ClaimBuster	13085	And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	13086	My fellow Americans, as I've said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much.	1
ClaimBuster	13087	These are not just women's issues.	0
ClaimBuster	13088	I was in the Lomax AME Church.	1
ClaimBuster	13089	You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.	1
ClaimBuster	13090	Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.	1
ClaimBuster	13091	Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.	1
ClaimBuster	13092	Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	13093	I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.	1
ClaimBuster	13094	And we are not well served when we attack each other in a kind of ad hominem way.	0
ClaimBuster	13095	We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.	0
ClaimBuster	13096	And my plan has a better chance of standing up and fighting for those troops.	0
ClaimBuster	13097	And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies.	1
ClaimBuster	13098	I think that's fundamental in our country, that you know what you're getting into.	0
ClaimBuster	13099	John, I'm sorry, but that's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	13100	Anyway, he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	13101	So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	13102	I won't hold it against him that he went to Yale.	0
ClaimBuster	13103	I thought he made the right decision to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	13104	We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest.	0
ClaimBuster	13105	The other day I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me.	1
ClaimBuster	13106	And I think Ross Perot has done a good job in having them.	0
ClaimBuster	13107	I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	13108	I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller states in the Congress who have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard.	0
ClaimBuster	13109	Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	13110	And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	13111	But what I've also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president.	0
ClaimBuster	13112	Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	13113	It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	13114	Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products.	0
ClaimBuster	13115	We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	13116	He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better.	0
ClaimBuster	13117	They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.	1
ClaimBuster	13118	We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.	1
ClaimBuster	13119	When the businesses go bankrupt, I know them.	0
ClaimBuster	13120	I have costed out what I'm going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	13121	There are 30 countries there.	1
ClaimBuster	13122	She's been doing this for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	13123	And that's the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it.	1
ClaimBuster	13124	Like Mr. Perot, I have held crack babies in my arms.	1
ClaimBuster	13125	And it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years.	0
ClaimBuster	13126	Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.	0
ClaimBuster	13127	He has no respect for our president.	0
ClaimBuster	13128	And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little.	0
ClaimBuster	13129	That is a bad policy.	0
ClaimBuster	13130	We just have a bad system.	0
ClaimBuster	13131	But we went from 2,200 to 500.	1
ClaimBuster	13132	So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	13133	Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they're stated by the Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	13134	And I've got a different vision for America.	0
ClaimBuster	13135	I can't let the man continue with fuzzy math.	0
ClaimBuster	13136	I'm going to hold that summit.	0
ClaimBuster	13137	It's a horrible thing she's doing.	0
ClaimBuster	13138	One by holding down the value of their currency.	0
ClaimBuster	13139	We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	13140	And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.	0
ClaimBuster	13141	We have to do this job.	0
ClaimBuster	13142	But since they're bred from childhood to fight with one another rather than get results, you know, I would be glad to drop out and spend a little time and see if we couldn't build some bridges.	0
ClaimBuster	13143	So is it President Obama's fault?	0
ClaimBuster	13144	He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.	1
ClaimBuster	13145	And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them.	1
ClaimBuster	13146	I don't have any PAC money in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	13147	Because China, Germany, they're making these investments.	1
ClaimBuster	13148	I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	13149	These weren't taken from abortion or something like that.	0
ClaimBuster	13150	Susan, I don't agree that there are no women and minorities in important positions in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	13151	I was one of only a few Democrats in the Senate to support the Persian Gulf War.	1
ClaimBuster	13152	Our party has been focused too long.	0
ClaimBuster	13153	There have been many wars in the history of mankind.	1
ClaimBuster	13154	Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained.	0
ClaimBuster	13155	One is make sure Congress doesn't overspend.	0
ClaimBuster	13156	And we can't expect that if we do the same things that we've been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome.	0
ClaimBuster	13157	I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty.	0
ClaimBuster	13158	My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them.	0
ClaimBuster	13159	And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact.	0
ClaimBuster	13160	We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.	0
ClaimBuster	13161	That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	13162	This doesn't have to be.	0
ClaimBuster	13163	Sometimes people who are very idealistic and have great dreams, as young people do, are apt to stay at arm's length from the political process because they think their good hearts might be brittle, and if they invest their hopes and allow themselves to believe, then they're gonna be let down and disappointed.	0
ClaimBuster	13164	Number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israel's security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	13165	Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	13166	I believe that 25 million people, the vast majority, long to have elections.	0
ClaimBuster	13167	Well obviously we wouldn't use the Russians if they didn't agree with our answer, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	13168	And to the governor's credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized.	1
ClaimBuster	13169	And if there's anything more unwise than that, I don't know what it is.	0
ClaimBuster	13170	And ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug.	1
ClaimBuster	13171	Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.	0
ClaimBuster	13172	I think it is a deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	13173	So that's -- that's number one.	0
ClaimBuster	13174	Just look at those little children, and if anybody can even think about legalizing drugs, they've lost me.	0
ClaimBuster	13175	Why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend?	0
ClaimBuster	13176	And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.	0
ClaimBuster	13177	Do you know that it's gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people?	0
ClaimBuster	13178	And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets -- I'll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use.	0
ClaimBuster	13179	The whole world has had economic problems.	1
ClaimBuster	13180	We ought to have universal pre-school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	13181	I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	13182	In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.	1
ClaimBuster	13183	But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it.	0
ClaimBuster	13184	I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example.	0
ClaimBuster	13185	All 50 states did it.	1
ClaimBuster	13186	And I'm standing here as someone who, a long time ago as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them.	1
ClaimBuster	13187	Well, why don't -- why don't -- let's talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.	0
ClaimBuster	13188	But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it.	0
ClaimBuster	13189	Now I want to go further.	0
ClaimBuster	13190	But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	13191	And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.	0
ClaimBuster	13192	I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.	1
ClaimBuster	13193	And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.	1
ClaimBuster	13194	I believe this economy is sound and that we're going to move up.	0
ClaimBuster	13195	An election law just in the last few days.	0
ClaimBuster	13196	But I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner.	0
ClaimBuster	13197	But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh - of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh - 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about - uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget.	1
ClaimBuster	13198	We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.	0
ClaimBuster	13199	I mean, we've cut defense spending too much in the first place.	1
ClaimBuster	13200	But let me respond to what you said.	0
ClaimBuster	13201	The President has not called for an unconditional end to the violence.	1
ClaimBuster	13202	And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	13203	We need to put health care records online.	0
ClaimBuster	13204	The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida.	0
ClaimBuster	13205	I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	13206	And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices -- I favor public schools or these new charter schools -- we can talk about that if you want.	0
ClaimBuster	13207	We didn't need that tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	13208	But maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.	0
ClaimBuster	13209	But they weren't taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	13210	Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit.	0
ClaimBuster	13211	I promise you the economy is going to get better.	0
ClaimBuster	13212	Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add.	0
ClaimBuster	13213	America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.	0
ClaimBuster	13214	And I don't want to do that, and I won't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	13215	And our enemies are strengthened from all of this.	0
ClaimBuster	13216	I'm going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system.	0
ClaimBuster	13217	I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	13218	He got a deferment or he didn't.	0
ClaimBuster	13219	They've always had stakes in it.	0
ClaimBuster	13220	So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	13221	If I'm elected we won't have Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	13222	Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.	1
ClaimBuster	13223	Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.	0
ClaimBuster	13224	If I may just briefly, Jim, note.	0
ClaimBuster	13225	I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.	0
ClaimBuster	13226	Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here.	0
ClaimBuster	13227	We can't do that to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	13228	So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.	1
ClaimBuster	13229	So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.	0
ClaimBuster	13230	Look, it's just not true.	0
ClaimBuster	13231	It not only happened in California.	1
ClaimBuster	13232	But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might.	0
ClaimBuster	13233	The interests of the American people must be at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	13234	You see, he's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending.	1
ClaimBuster	13235	And we could be moving out to the human population a whole lot faster than we are on some of these new drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	13236	World peace is important, and we have enhanced the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	13237	We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals.	1
ClaimBuster	13238	She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.	1
ClaimBuster	13239	And I have to make that judgment.	1
ClaimBuster	13240	All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.	0
ClaimBuster	13241	So I made a mistake, and I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak.	0
ClaimBuster	13242	But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?	0
ClaimBuster	13243	This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress.	1
ClaimBuster	13244	It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.	0
ClaimBuster	13245	I do want to make sure that...	0
ClaimBuster	13246	I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.	1
ClaimBuster	13247	I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	13248	I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.	1
ClaimBuster	13249	And I also think it's very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform.	0
ClaimBuster	13250	the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible.	0
ClaimBuster	13251	"They're trying to say, ""Did you make a mistake going into Iraq?"""	0
ClaimBuster	13252	He didn't take that position on Tibet.	1
ClaimBuster	13253	Because they have to balance their budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	13254	And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	13255	I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.	1
ClaimBuster	13256	There's another, a similar issue out there that relates to your -- it is said, at least, that you were unaware that the Soviet retaliatory power was based on land-based missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	13257	We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we -- we push back and give them more economic development.	0
ClaimBuster	13258	Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad.	0
ClaimBuster	13259	Every 4 years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual.	0
ClaimBuster	13260	We announce we're going after Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	13261	I'm not even certain you were too excited about that.	0
ClaimBuster	13262	I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.	1
ClaimBuster	13263	It's a fairly rural state.	1
ClaimBuster	13264	The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.	0
ClaimBuster	13265	But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	13266	The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.	0
ClaimBuster	13267	Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.	1
ClaimBuster	13268	Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	13269	And we need to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	13270	Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute?	0
ClaimBuster	13271	This is a great land.	0
ClaimBuster	13272	And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right.	0
ClaimBuster	13273	But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.	0
ClaimBuster	13274	Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.	0
ClaimBuster	13275	Let me give you another example.	0
ClaimBuster	13276	There is a tax gap.	1
ClaimBuster	13277	It is 1.3 trillion Mr. Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	13278	But having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism.	0
ClaimBuster	13279	That's one of my promises.	0
ClaimBuster	13280	We've had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you.	1
ClaimBuster	13281	"You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying, ""Don't bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you weren't part of our original coalition."""	1
ClaimBuster	13282	And we can enforce law.	0
ClaimBuster	13283	What I care about is children.	0
ClaimBuster	13284	So I changed the Justice Department's effort to get a church to pay back a man tithe, because he was bankrupt when he gave it.	1
ClaimBuster	13285	"I've got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I can't get treatment."""	1
ClaimBuster	13286	"And that institution, the House of Representatives -- everyone is yelling ""Clean House!"""	1
ClaimBuster	13287	That is my solemn obligation.	0
ClaimBuster	13288	In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.	1
ClaimBuster	13289	There's been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards.	1
ClaimBuster	13290	I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them.	0
ClaimBuster	13291	In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.	1
ClaimBuster	13292	That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	13293	People will tell you who served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word.	0
ClaimBuster	13294	We have a Democratic Congress today, and fortunately we've had a Republican president to check their excesses with my vetoes.	1
ClaimBuster	13295	When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.	1
ClaimBuster	13296	We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows we strengthened control of the border.	1
ClaimBuster	13297	I'd never ask you to do anything for me, but I owe you this, and I'm doing it for you.	0
ClaimBuster	13298	You attended a private school for some time in your life.	1
ClaimBuster	13299	We've got to do something about this.	0
ClaimBuster	13300	I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city, when there's hopelessness at home, lack of work, and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	13301	We don't have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps.	0
ClaimBuster	13302	And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented.	0
ClaimBuster	13303	A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.	1
ClaimBuster	13304	We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.	0
ClaimBuster	13305	But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done.	1
ClaimBuster	13306	And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there.	1
ClaimBuster	13307	But it is true our borders are out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	13308	And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...	1
ClaimBuster	13309	I'm not going to set the White House visitors schedule before I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	13310	Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills.	1
ClaimBuster	13311	These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.	0
ClaimBuster	13312	You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.	0
ClaimBuster	13313	The American people are pretty smart: they know who writes out the checks.	0
ClaimBuster	13314	Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.	0
ClaimBuster	13315	She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what I'm going through.	1
ClaimBuster	13316	Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?	0
ClaimBuster	13317	Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.	1
ClaimBuster	13318	Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953.	1
ClaimBuster	13319	When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now.	0
ClaimBuster	13320	We need to make it clear we're for human liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	13321	I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	13322	That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.	1
ClaimBuster	13323	And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	13324	I believe we should be stronger than we now are.	0
ClaimBuster	13325	You can't ship them overseas anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	13326	I know what it's like to go out on one of those missions when you don't know what's around the corner.	0
ClaimBuster	13327	Uh - this would - would help a great deal.	0
ClaimBuster	13328	The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today.	1
ClaimBuster	13329	Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve.	1
ClaimBuster	13330	Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we're the only ones that can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	13331	It's a culture that somewhere along the line we've begun to disrespect life.	0
ClaimBuster	13332	I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	13333	It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?	0
ClaimBuster	13334	We now import about 44 percent of our oil.	1
ClaimBuster	13335	Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it.	0
ClaimBuster	13336	I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.	1
ClaimBuster	13337	You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.	0
ClaimBuster	13338	"And she looked at me from her hospital bed and she just looked at me and she said, ""Remember: integrity, integrity, integrity."	1
ClaimBuster	13339	You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.	1
ClaimBuster	13340	I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children.	1
ClaimBuster	13341	I take my job seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	13342	And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment.	0
ClaimBuster	13343	And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.	1
ClaimBuster	13344	Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	13345	And the last statement, just a few days ago, was a speech to the effect that we have inflation because Government revenues have not kept pace with Government spending.	1
ClaimBuster	13346	He said that no man with that size misery index has a right to seek reelection to the Presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	13347	In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	13348	Again we turn to the past.	0
ClaimBuster	13349	Are we better of with this arms race?	0
ClaimBuster	13350	I've always been against them.	1
ClaimBuster	13351	Nothing's going to ever happen.	0
ClaimBuster	13352	There's a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline.	1
ClaimBuster	13353	It's an issue throughout our society.	0
ClaimBuster	13354	I think any time we end with one of these attacks, it's appropriate to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	13355	It used to be that the average - uh family could own a house.	1
ClaimBuster	13356	A record is never something to stand on.	0
ClaimBuster	13357	We're bringing our jobs back.	0
ClaimBuster	13358	Hey, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you decide what to do with it.	0
ClaimBuster	13359	So what do we do?	0
ClaimBuster	13360	We need to strengthen that in order to assure our Western allies of our presence there, a strong defense, but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	13361	Now, it's $4.00 a gallon.	1
ClaimBuster	13362	My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law.	1
ClaimBuster	13363	It's called Immediate Helping Hand.	1
ClaimBuster	13364	But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.	0
ClaimBuster	13365	Thanks a lot for doing a great job.	0
ClaimBuster	13366	Well, I did with my first statement.	1
ClaimBuster	13367	"I've had shop stewards stand up and say, ""Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?"	1
ClaimBuster	13368	We're proud to be here.	0
ClaimBuster	13369	Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.	1
ClaimBuster	13370	See, what you see is what you get and if you don't like it, you got two other choices, right?	0
ClaimBuster	13371	And the exit strategy needs to be well-defined.	0
ClaimBuster	13372	... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.	0
ClaimBuster	13373	When the -- when the president of Iraq -- excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that's a frightening thing.	1
ClaimBuster	13374	No, I don't think that's the right answer.	0
ClaimBuster	13375	I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in.	0
ClaimBuster	13376	And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going.	0
ClaimBuster	13377	If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.	1
ClaimBuster	13378	We can't sanction them any more.	0
ClaimBuster	13379	Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	13380	What we're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need.	0
ClaimBuster	13381	She had a chance to do something with Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	13382	Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?	0
ClaimBuster	13383	We need more resources there.	0
ClaimBuster	13384	And I have great respect and admiration for his wife.	0
ClaimBuster	13385	Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light.	0
ClaimBuster	13386	Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify.	1
ClaimBuster	13387	And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend.	0
ClaimBuster	13388	I also presented to the Congress and they adopted a large package of quality-of-life improvements, which are very important.	1
ClaimBuster	13389	Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.	0
ClaimBuster	13390	We have to have nuclear power.	0
ClaimBuster	13391	But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	13392	I disagree that we need 150,000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	13393	The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years.	1
ClaimBuster	13394	And so, this is a reasonable policy to protect old stands of trees and at the same time make sure our forests aren't vulnerable to the forest fires that have destroyed acres after acres in the West.	1
ClaimBuster	13395	See, I think the mission has somewhat become fuzzy.	0
ClaimBuster	13396	Not one of them are paid for.	1
ClaimBuster	13397	So let's go through them one by one.	0
ClaimBuster	13398	Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich.	0
ClaimBuster	13399	Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.	1
ClaimBuster	13400	It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.	0
ClaimBuster	13401	I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies.	0
ClaimBuster	13402	I'm here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare.	1
ClaimBuster	13403	And this is what the Republicans have done to us.	0
ClaimBuster	13404	"This is different from saying, ""OK, let me incent you to go on the government."""	0
ClaimBuster	13405	Five million homes were lost.	1
ClaimBuster	13406	It is the same overall strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	13407	I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America.	0
ClaimBuster	13408	We can't continue to shuffle children through school.	0
ClaimBuster	13409	You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion.	1
ClaimBuster	13410	And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business.	0
ClaimBuster	13411	And I'm glad we're going in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	13412	This country uh - changed drastically in 1969 when the uh - terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and - and Gerald Ford became the presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	13413	There is a partnership involved in our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	13414	But Social Security is a tax.	0
ClaimBuster	13415	There's a lot of good people working hard.	0
ClaimBuster	13416	But in order to stop this arms madness, we've got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	13417	And they really matter when you are president.	0
ClaimBuster	13418	Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.	0
ClaimBuster	13419	Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else.	1
ClaimBuster	13420	I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard.	1
ClaimBuster	13421	As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.	1
ClaimBuster	13422	Whose taxes will you raise?	0
ClaimBuster	13423	And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it's a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.	0
ClaimBuster	13424	And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.	0
ClaimBuster	13425	Well, I would say first of all, I think, it's a very good question.	0
ClaimBuster	13426	One of the reasons that I ran for president, Sandy, is because not just children, a lot of grownups felt that way.	0
ClaimBuster	13427	And, incidentally, may I say that that's the decision of the Congress, and the president has concurred.	0
ClaimBuster	13428	They will live the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	13429	I believe in this goal and effort with all my heart.	0
ClaimBuster	13430	Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq -- $200 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	13431	Senator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people who voted against Medicare and he was proud of it.	1
ClaimBuster	13432	And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.	0
ClaimBuster	13433	We've had record numbers of new small businesses and 10 and a half million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	13434	I look at the trial lawyers, and when you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts 35 million into the pot.	0
ClaimBuster	13435	I made a decision not to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which is where our troops could be brought to -- brought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge.	1
ClaimBuster	13436	That was locker room talk.	1
ClaimBuster	13437	Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.	1
ClaimBuster	13438	What he said was a precipitous...	0
ClaimBuster	13439	...because the private sector's not going to invest in a...	0
ClaimBuster	13440	If I become president, I'll get America working again.	0
ClaimBuster	13441	We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production.	0
ClaimBuster	13442	Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next president's term of four years is over.	1
ClaimBuster	13443	And so I just have to say, it's fine.	0
ClaimBuster	13444	... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.	0
ClaimBuster	13445	I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn.	0
ClaimBuster	13446	We could have an urban homestead act.	0
ClaimBuster	13447	It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	13448	But take Russia, for example.	0
ClaimBuster	13449	I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it.	1
ClaimBuster	13450	And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?	0
ClaimBuster	13451	We need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do.	0
ClaimBuster	13452	I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there's some pretty egregious examples recently.	0
ClaimBuster	13453	And now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump.	0
ClaimBuster	13454	When we talk about cutting health care costs, let's start with the insurance companies and the people that are making a killing instead of making our people healthy.	0
ClaimBuster	13455	And once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.	1
ClaimBuster	13456	Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum.	0
ClaimBuster	13457	I believe that we have to win this.	0
ClaimBuster	13458	Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business.	1
ClaimBuster	13459	I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot.	0
ClaimBuster	13460	Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.	1
ClaimBuster	13461	And we've been guilty of that.	0
ClaimBuster	13462	"Frankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, ""I'm sorry, you'll have to wait."""	0
ClaimBuster	13463	I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to.	0
ClaimBuster	13464	And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.	0
ClaimBuster	13465	They're supposed to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against drugs, because they don't have enough fuel.	0
ClaimBuster	13466	I will never let those troops down, and will hunt and kill the terrorists wherever they are.	0
ClaimBuster	13467	Now when the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation -- he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our -- our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration.	1
ClaimBuster	13468	You know what he said?	0
ClaimBuster	13469	You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.	1
ClaimBuster	13470	Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	13471	I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people; secondly to say that we have to enforce the law in 2 ways.	0
ClaimBuster	13472	As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm.	0
ClaimBuster	13473	Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen, I don't know yet.	0
ClaimBuster	13474	What about the honor of my state?	0
ClaimBuster	13475	I've made no judgment about who should be secretary of state.	0
ClaimBuster	13476	Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	13477	And so people are going to have to look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	13478	People who got all the jobs were benefiting.	0
ClaimBuster	13479	Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that.	0
ClaimBuster	13480	One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.	1
ClaimBuster	13481	and kind of humiliating them is not the way you make the kind of progress we are getting.	0
ClaimBuster	13482	Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.	1
ClaimBuster	13483	I'm glad you clarified it.	0
ClaimBuster	13484	Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader.	0
ClaimBuster	13485	But look, what's really important, Charlie, is the president is just trying to scare everybody here with throwing labels around.	1
ClaimBuster	13486	So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.	1
ClaimBuster	13487	These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured.	1
ClaimBuster	13488	It's a scaring -- he's trying to scare people in the voting booth.	0
ClaimBuster	13489	I've reached out to people all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	13490	There is a thing called clean coal.	1
ClaimBuster	13491	Well, let me just make a closing point.	0
ClaimBuster	13492	Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they're not, have measures on the books that don't take forever and a day to implement.	0
ClaimBuster	13493	Ninety percent of the costs are coming out of your pockets.	1
ClaimBuster	13494	The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.	1
ClaimBuster	13495	Joe Lieberman and I gave them six months to clean up their act.	1
ClaimBuster	13496	In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits -- there was nothing wrong with having deficits.	1
ClaimBuster	13497	That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	13498	America is not standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	13499	I'm worried about our country.	0
ClaimBuster	13500	Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	13501	It's small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.	1
ClaimBuster	13502	I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	13503	I ask for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	13504	We are now spending $10 billion or more every month.	1
ClaimBuster	13505	My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.	1
ClaimBuster	13506	So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they've been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that.	1
ClaimBuster	13507	They're fighting us because they're fighting freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	13508	This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken.	0
ClaimBuster	13509	Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science.	1
ClaimBuster	13510	We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	13511	Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.	0
ClaimBuster	13512	We need to reform Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	13513	You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace.	0
ClaimBuster	13514	A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.	1
ClaimBuster	13515	So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.	0
ClaimBuster	13516	"As a matter of fact, I read in the ""New York Times"" where he said he co-sponsored the McCain-Feingold Campaign Fundraising Bill."	1
ClaimBuster	13517	If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy?	0
ClaimBuster	13518	I've been AWOL for 44 months, so let's take on smoking, see they haven't even done it.	1
ClaimBuster	13519	And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.	1
ClaimBuster	13520	If I'm president I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.	0
ClaimBuster	13521	And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.	1
ClaimBuster	13522	We had someone who I'm sure regrets said it in the president's staff said he didn't care whether we made potato chips or computer chips.	1
ClaimBuster	13523	And we'll continue to protect our borders.	0
ClaimBuster	13524	That's a tribute to their interest in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	13525	They create government-sponsored health care.	1
ClaimBuster	13526	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.	1
ClaimBuster	13527	President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.	0
ClaimBuster	13528	I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.	1
ClaimBuster	13529	Well, again, the president didn't answer the question.	1
ClaimBuster	13530	"We said, ""Peace through strength,"" and it worked and the cold war is over."	1
ClaimBuster	13531	90 percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those I've outlined in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	13532	He's troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today.	0
ClaimBuster	13533	Because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airways, because what drives the cost of campaigns are the cost of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing.	1
ClaimBuster	13534	And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	13535	And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years.	0
ClaimBuster	13536	The federal government didn't hire our teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	13537	We've got to help the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	13538	But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again.	0
ClaimBuster	13539	When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said.	1
ClaimBuster	13540	There must be an absolute guarantee.	0
ClaimBuster	13541	And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.	0
ClaimBuster	13542	You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater.	1
ClaimBuster	13543	The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation.	1
ClaimBuster	13544	They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.	1
ClaimBuster	13545	But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker.	0
ClaimBuster	13546	Some of them got it for a birthday present.	1
ClaimBuster	13547	Well, I thought the question was about defense.	0
ClaimBuster	13548	That was vouchers, Senator Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	13549	There's no way of glossing around that.	0
ClaimBuster	13550	... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.	0
ClaimBuster	13551	I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me.	0
ClaimBuster	13552	I believe that uh - our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality.	0
ClaimBuster	13553	To me, Affirmative Action is making that extra effort.	0
ClaimBuster	13554	When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	13555	I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program.	0
ClaimBuster	13556	That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.	1
ClaimBuster	13557	And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government.	0
ClaimBuster	13558	I just couldn't let it stand.	0
ClaimBuster	13559	Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.	0
ClaimBuster	13560	First, the National Journal named Senator Kennedy the most liberal senator of all.	1
ClaimBuster	13561	I wasn't misleading when I said he was a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	13562	That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you.	0
ClaimBuster	13563	With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.	0
ClaimBuster	13564	Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who don't?	0
ClaimBuster	13565	As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.	0
ClaimBuster	13566	The last budget he led cut Pell Grants, cut student loans.	1
ClaimBuster	13567	There are some programs that are underfunded.	0
ClaimBuster	13568	A lot of them lost their lives.	1
ClaimBuster	13569	But let's turn for a minute to the uhh - southern African operations that are now going on.	0
ClaimBuster	13570	I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	13571	Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.	0
ClaimBuster	13572	I've worked on the food stamp program, proudly.	1
ClaimBuster	13573	We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	13574	I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we'll enforce it.	0
ClaimBuster	13575	Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America.	0
ClaimBuster	13576	We're using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across.	1
ClaimBuster	13577	We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	13578	It's also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we're now in.	0
ClaimBuster	13579	And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage.	0
ClaimBuster	13580	So I would simply say, as these dates get close, you're going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	13581	No one is suggesting that.	0
ClaimBuster	13582	But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	13583	It's one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	13584	For -- so if you're -- if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this -- this will affect you.	1
ClaimBuster	13585	She's been trying to take them out for a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	13586	In a > Transfer interrupted!	0
ClaimBuster	13587	I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	13588	I was in coal country in West Virginia yesterday.	1
ClaimBuster	13589	And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	13590	And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	13591	And, by the way, I want to go back a second.	0
ClaimBuster	13592	And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class.	0
ClaimBuster	13593	She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	13594	And we created an OSHA - an Occupational Safety and Health Agency - for the protection of employees before the Federal Government had one in place.	1
ClaimBuster	13595	I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.	1
ClaimBuster	13596	We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	13597	There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.	0
ClaimBuster	13598	As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available.	0
ClaimBuster	13599	I'm not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his.	0
ClaimBuster	13600	Now, I'd like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks.	0
ClaimBuster	13601	Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn't want him to be furloughed again.	1
ClaimBuster	13602	And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity.	0
ClaimBuster	13603	We had to go in when they came in.	0
ClaimBuster	13604	In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with.	0
ClaimBuster	13605	I might say the results are highly ambiguous.	0
ClaimBuster	13606	It may be a long period, but we must - we must get started immediately.	0
ClaimBuster	13607	Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment.	0
ClaimBuster	13608	He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.	1
ClaimBuster	13609	And before you solve it, you have to say the name.	0
ClaimBuster	13610	That was the reason Congress gave him the authority to use force, not after excuse to get rid of the regime.	0
ClaimBuster	13611	You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	13612	Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.	0
ClaimBuster	13613	But I believe together we can make great progress.	0
ClaimBuster	13614	There will be elections in January.	1
ClaimBuster	13615	So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.	1
ClaimBuster	13616	You remember we increased that child credit by $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	13617	I just told this lady over here we spent -- went from $10 billion to $30 billion to protect the homeland.	1
ClaimBuster	13618	"When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, ""This can't go on."""	1
ClaimBuster	13619	People's rights have been abused.	0
ClaimBuster	13620	And housing starts - he compares the housing starts with last year.	0
ClaimBuster	13621	But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.	0
ClaimBuster	13622	Not just at the high end.	0
ClaimBuster	13623	But she said she'll be awake.	1
ClaimBuster	13624	I have worked to support our country as the world's strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security.	0
ClaimBuster	13625	What I want the voters to do is to make a decision.	0
ClaimBuster	13626	And we want to bring him to justice.	0
ClaimBuster	13627	And if Iraq were to fail, it'd be a haven for terrorists, and there would be money and the world would be much more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	13628	So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.	1
ClaimBuster	13629	That's why we need a Democratic administration in Washington in 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	13630	I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.	0
ClaimBuster	13631	And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.	0
ClaimBuster	13632	We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.	1
ClaimBuster	13633	I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.	0
ClaimBuster	13634	America needed to be safe.	0
ClaimBuster	13635	When Barbara holds an AIDS baby, she's showing a certain compassion for family; when she reads to children, the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	13636	I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind.	0
ClaimBuster	13637	We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.	0
ClaimBuster	13638	It would be a game changer.	0
ClaimBuster	13639	You got to send down some more people, because the president's found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property.	1
ClaimBuster	13640	"We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, ""Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but he's our dictator."""	0
ClaimBuster	13641	But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	13642	So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions.	0
ClaimBuster	13643	Now, we're now kidding anybody, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	13644	He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would've threatened the Middle Eastern world supply.	1
ClaimBuster	13645	But I would just say this.	0
ClaimBuster	13646	And that's why I'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	13647	She does not have a...	0
ClaimBuster	13648	And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.	0
ClaimBuster	13649	And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.	0
ClaimBuster	13650	And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.	0
ClaimBuster	13651	And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly.	0
ClaimBuster	13652	It'd be fine with me.	0
ClaimBuster	13653	But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar.	0
ClaimBuster	13654	And I've been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.	0
ClaimBuster	13655	The first I've -- who gave it that name?	0
ClaimBuster	13656	I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	13657	And so we've got to reverse this.	0
ClaimBuster	13658	We have a depleted military.	1
ClaimBuster	13659	I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade.	0
ClaimBuster	13660	I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	13661	I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	13662	We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	13663	Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.	1
ClaimBuster	13664	And that's what I did with that vote.	0
ClaimBuster	13665	For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	13666	But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.	1
ClaimBuster	13667	I will be a president for all of our people.	0
ClaimBuster	13668	"They get on me -- Bill's gotten on me about, ""read my lips."""	0
ClaimBuster	13669	Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.	0
ClaimBuster	13670	So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	13671	Well, we've taken the first step.	0
ClaimBuster	13672	We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	13673	Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.	1
ClaimBuster	13674	And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that.	0
ClaimBuster	13675	I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.	0
ClaimBuster	13676	I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform.	0
ClaimBuster	13677	But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us.	0
ClaimBuster	13678	Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works.	0
ClaimBuster	13679	Well, he raised the question of my father -- it was a good line, well rehearsed and well delivered.	1
ClaimBuster	13680	So he may not be the right person to talk to.	0
ClaimBuster	13681	We have to have our people at work.	0
ClaimBuster	13682	And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.	1
ClaimBuster	13683	I'm pleased the president made the decision he made.	0
ClaimBuster	13684	On the broad issue here, when you're trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans.	0
ClaimBuster	13685	And you asked a great question because it's not only seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	13686	I like Meg Whitman, she knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace.	0
ClaimBuster	13687	I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	13688	That's why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal.	1
ClaimBuster	13689	And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.	0
ClaimBuster	13690	This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	13691	And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	13692	Well, Katie (ph), thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	13693	Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that's the question of pardons.	0
ClaimBuster	13694	But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them.	1
ClaimBuster	13695	I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.	0
ClaimBuster	13696	And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	13697	Fixing our training programs for our workers.	0
ClaimBuster	13698	You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.	1
ClaimBuster	13699	He didn't have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.	1
ClaimBuster	13700	This is going to take first, building a consensus at grassroots America.	0
ClaimBuster	13701	Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them.	0
ClaimBuster	13702	One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet.	1
ClaimBuster	13703	I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	13704	And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength.	1
ClaimBuster	13705	And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	13706	And I think I know what he meant by that.	0
ClaimBuster	13707	I'm going to pay for this later on.	0
ClaimBuster	13708	That was something I concurred with...	1
ClaimBuster	13709	President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.	1
ClaimBuster	13710	The president just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror.	1
ClaimBuster	13711	That's the wrong way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	13712	The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia.	0
ClaimBuster	13713	He's had experience in it.	1
ClaimBuster	13714	It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us.	0
ClaimBuster	13715	So what we have to do is two things.	0
ClaimBuster	13716	But there's a better way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	13717	I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.	1
ClaimBuster	13718	That's the way you bring a deficit down and help to improve the quality of life for people at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	13719	But he has made -- not admitted a mistake and I just find it impossible to understand how an American can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land -- organizing demonstrations against it when young men are held prisoner in Hanoi or kids out of the ghetto were drafted.	1
ClaimBuster	13720	That's the task of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	13721	However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that.	1
ClaimBuster	13722	But it's less than 1 percent of the total cost of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	13723	On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you.	1
ClaimBuster	13724	And that's something which will be a priority of ours in the new administration because without it, we cannot have the effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent we must have.	0
ClaimBuster	13725	I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.	0
ClaimBuster	13726	But Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire.	0
ClaimBuster	13727	Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	13728	But beyond that we need to address the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	13729	Daniel, I don't support a draft.	0
ClaimBuster	13730	Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.	1
ClaimBuster	13731	I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.	0
ClaimBuster	13732	And I don't agree with it.	0
ClaimBuster	13733	I said I would have the Secretary of Defense sit down.	1
ClaimBuster	13734	Iran has Iraq as one of its neighbors.	1
ClaimBuster	13735	Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue.	0
ClaimBuster	13736	Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.	0
ClaimBuster	13737	I want to build on that.	0
ClaimBuster	13738	"He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign."	1
ClaimBuster	13739	We are better off than we were four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	13740	If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.	0
ClaimBuster	13741	Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time.	1
ClaimBuster	13742	I don't force you to do anything.	0
ClaimBuster	13743	And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.	0
ClaimBuster	13744	We're going the make great deals.	0
ClaimBuster	13745	We've been there a long time, and we've got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	13746	He doesn't fix it for ten years.	1
ClaimBuster	13747	There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	13748	We're going to make America safe again.	0
ClaimBuster	13749	And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.	1
ClaimBuster	13750	Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.	1
ClaimBuster	13751	That, however, is not my only passion.	0
ClaimBuster	13752	There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.	1
ClaimBuster	13753	And that's to be honored.	0
ClaimBuster	13754	Let me just give you one tiny example.	0
ClaimBuster	13755	I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money.	0
ClaimBuster	13756	And that's what we're doing.	1
ClaimBuster	13757	We expect there to be standards met and we expect there to be measurement.	0
ClaimBuster	13758	She and her son Bryan, they came to see me.	1
ClaimBuster	13759	It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side.	0
ClaimBuster	13760	But Washington is a tough town.	0
ClaimBuster	13761	"I mean, ""compassionate conservative,"" what does that mean?"	0
ClaimBuster	13762	But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write -- I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s.	1
ClaimBuster	13763	But I'm all for NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	13764	And God bless them, every one of them decided on their own to come here this evening.	1
ClaimBuster	13765	And if they are, fine.	0
ClaimBuster	13766	Let me say this to you, I wouldn't use force.	0
ClaimBuster	13767	Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.	1
ClaimBuster	13768	And that's not going to happen by just hiring teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	13769	I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage.	0
ClaimBuster	13770	So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people.	1
ClaimBuster	13771	But that's Senate inside baseball.	0
ClaimBuster	13772	I can tell him some I'm against.	0
ClaimBuster	13773	He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.	1
ClaimBuster	13774	It shouldn't be politicized in any way by the President or by his opponent.	0
ClaimBuster	13775	"The truth of that matter is, if you listen carefully, Saddam would still be in power if he were the president of the United States, ""And the world would be a lot better off."""	0
ClaimBuster	13776	In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	13777	But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families.	0
ClaimBuster	13778	I am not parsing words.	0
ClaimBuster	13779	Obamacare was the first step.	0
ClaimBuster	13780	Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and I'm happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this.	1
ClaimBuster	13781	That's why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe.	0
ClaimBuster	13782	It was a big, big mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	13783	94% comes from the local level.	1
ClaimBuster	13784	She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.	1
ClaimBuster	13785	And this strategy, and this general, they are winning.	0
ClaimBuster	13786	We need to deny them the safe havens.	0
ClaimBuster	13787	Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	13788	But it was a terrible recession.	0
ClaimBuster	13789	Since I've been in office, we've had a steady, carefully planned, methodical but, very effective increase in our commitment for defense.	1
ClaimBuster	13790	The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war.	0
ClaimBuster	13791	You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	13792	And, by the way, Senator Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be.	1
ClaimBuster	13793	I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.	0
ClaimBuster	13794	And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.	1
ClaimBuster	13795	It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	13796	Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.	1
ClaimBuster	13797	Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	13798	I want to change many of its provisions.	0
ClaimBuster	13799	And for the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council.	1
ClaimBuster	13800	I want, Joe, you to do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	13801	Now, leaders will always make mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	13802	In Iraq, we'll be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful.	0
ClaimBuster	13803	I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.	0
ClaimBuster	13804	Let's don't -- you don't have to believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	13805	And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.	0
ClaimBuster	13806	He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	13807	Now, my problem is -- I heard what he said.	0
ClaimBuster	13808	Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages.	0
ClaimBuster	13809	What message does that send to our allies?	0
ClaimBuster	13810	And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school.	1
ClaimBuster	13811	You know, I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	13812	I wish I knew the law because I would darn sure sign it.	0
ClaimBuster	13813	Some of them I voted for.	1
ClaimBuster	13814	And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that I have talked about to move our economy, we're going to grow sufficiently, it would begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	13815	(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope.	0
ClaimBuster	13816	meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba.	0
ClaimBuster	13817	This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road.	0
ClaimBuster	13818	That is the obligation upon our generation.	0
ClaimBuster	13819	And for those of you working, thanks from the bottom of my heart.	0
ClaimBuster	13820	I know how to make that happen.	0
ClaimBuster	13821	But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.	0
ClaimBuster	13822	The President says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	13823	Trying to find my light.	0
ClaimBuster	13824	And she could have done this years ago, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	13825	All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years.	0
ClaimBuster	13826	And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.	1
ClaimBuster	13827	I have been in politics for some time, and I worry about the people who don't vote.	0
ClaimBuster	13828	I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	13829	So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.	0
ClaimBuster	13830	Our bill was far more effective.	0
ClaimBuster	13831	Who are we to say, well, under certain circumstances, it's all right, but under other circumstances it isn't?	0
ClaimBuster	13832	Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself.	0
ClaimBuster	13833	And indeed, every time it has increased you will find there is an increase in minority unemployment among young people.	1
ClaimBuster	13834	This was not a way to pay down the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	13835	It is so sad when you see what's happened.	0
ClaimBuster	13836	I know this, 100% will get it if I'm the president.	0
ClaimBuster	13837	To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact.	0
ClaimBuster	13838	Let's limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	13839	I don't use language like that and I don't think that we should.	0
ClaimBuster	13840	He stood on principle standing up to the Soviet Union, and we won that conflict.	1
ClaimBuster	13841	So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	13842	In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	13843	And the $650 isn't even on that.	0
ClaimBuster	13844	I was chairman of it once.	1
ClaimBuster	13845	It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.	0
ClaimBuster	13846	We'll have specific differences later.	0
ClaimBuster	13847	When they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money.	0
ClaimBuster	13848	And Senator Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words.	0
ClaimBuster	13849	It's God's will, it'll happen.	0
ClaimBuster	13850	And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not.	0
ClaimBuster	13851	I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.	0
ClaimBuster	13852	I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	13853	We need to reach out to moderate Arab nations as well to build coalitions to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	13854	So here's what I've done since I've been president.	0
ClaimBuster	13855	So far, Mr. Ford has not done it.	1
ClaimBuster	13856	I've tried to use the White House as a bully pulpit, speaking out against discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	13857	It's really a matter of culture.	0
ClaimBuster	13858	In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll.	1
ClaimBuster	13859	But you have to work together.	0
ClaimBuster	13860	And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.	0
ClaimBuster	13861	We've achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it.	1
ClaimBuster	13862	And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.	1
ClaimBuster	13863	Once you have that understanding and mutual respect, then we can transcend the differences and embrace the highest common denominator of the American spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	13864	I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh - the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh - South Korea in an area of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	13865	Keep my promises to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	13866	As far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care.	0
ClaimBuster	13867	But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you.	0
ClaimBuster	13868	We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.	0
ClaimBuster	13869	He's praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who's -- who shows great wisdom and judgment.	1
ClaimBuster	13870	And that's why I'll be a better commander in chief.	0
ClaimBuster	13871	When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?	0
ClaimBuster	13872	One's in technical school, one's an honor student in high school.	1
ClaimBuster	13873	We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	13874	And, finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid to this country.	1
ClaimBuster	13875	He's arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D'Amato in the last couple years so I'm more familiar with his comments than I used to be.	1
ClaimBuster	13876	This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice.	0
ClaimBuster	13877	If the president's energy policies are working, you're going to see the cost of energy come down.	1
ClaimBuster	13878	Will he join me in suggesting that we may need another plant?	0
ClaimBuster	13879	And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending.	0
ClaimBuster	13880	But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?	0
ClaimBuster	13881	Take a look at the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	13882	Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism -- even if they don't like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there.	0
ClaimBuster	13883	And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, I'll put $2 toward paying down the national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	13884	We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology.	0
ClaimBuster	13885	I've learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress.	1
ClaimBuster	13886	And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.	0
ClaimBuster	13887	I have seen four wars in my lifetime.	1
ClaimBuster	13888	He has surrounded himself with former KGB apparatchiks.	1
ClaimBuster	13889	Now, as to why I should be and he shouldn't be, when he was a candidate in 1976, President Carter invented a thing he called the misery index.	1
ClaimBuster	13890	I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.	0
ClaimBuster	13891	That's an interruption, by the way.	1
ClaimBuster	13892	But character is an important part of the equation.	0
ClaimBuster	13893	The point is that as we look at this nation's future, and we have two very different visions of this future.	0
ClaimBuster	13894	Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	13895	It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear.	0
ClaimBuster	13896	He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	13897	We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is.	1
ClaimBuster	13898	And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.	1
ClaimBuster	13899	But there was fortunately others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action.	0
ClaimBuster	13900	And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.	1
ClaimBuster	13901	I would hope an incident like that would not happen.	0
ClaimBuster	13902	I appreciate the quote from the young man.	0
ClaimBuster	13903	What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	13904	But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going.	0
ClaimBuster	13905	We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.	0
ClaimBuster	13906	And when those rich corporations don't pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for 'em.	0
ClaimBuster	13907	And I don't think it's uh - the Congress is Mr. Ford's opponent; but if uh - if - if he insists that uh - that I be responsible for the Democratic Congress, of which I'm - have not been a part, then I think it's only fair that he be responsible for the Nixon administration in its entirety, of which he was a part.	1
ClaimBuster	13908	But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	13909	They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.	1
ClaimBuster	13910	See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.	0
ClaimBuster	13911	And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group.	1
ClaimBuster	13912	It's the law-abiding citizens who will do that.	0
ClaimBuster	13913	I'll be glad to answer any question you have, but this election ought to be about the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	13914	Defense industries are going to have to convert to civilian industries.	0
ClaimBuster	13915	I know a lot of them that aren't working.	1
ClaimBuster	13916	Now, we can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	13917	We can't simply be focused on Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	13918	I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	13919	Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence.	0
ClaimBuster	13920	I want to see peace.	0
ClaimBuster	13921	It's time for America to find new leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	13922	Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies.	1
ClaimBuster	13923	And what I don't like is trickle down government.	0
ClaimBuster	13924	And when I'm president, I will.	0
ClaimBuster	13925	But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.	0
ClaimBuster	13926	And I intend to win it as President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	13927	But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	13928	And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	13929	He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.	0
ClaimBuster	13930	The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	13931	Now, I don't think that's a bad idea.	0
ClaimBuster	13932	First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.	0
ClaimBuster	13933	You've done a great job.	0
ClaimBuster	13934	Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we're doing going forward.	0
ClaimBuster	13935	It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC.	1
ClaimBuster	13936	It was part of our other economic plan.	1
ClaimBuster	13937	And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace.	0
ClaimBuster	13938	And he's been proposing all kinds of programs for new spending costing billions.	1
ClaimBuster	13939	Nine million people lost their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	13940	I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably.	0
ClaimBuster	13941	And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.	1
ClaimBuster	13942	And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.	0
ClaimBuster	13943	But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.	0
ClaimBuster	13944	One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don't have to pay U.S. taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	13945	But it does seem to me that you've raised a very important point that needs to be addressed.	0
ClaimBuster	13946	And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security.	0
ClaimBuster	13947	If we fail then, if we're unable to come to an agreement - and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers.	0
ClaimBuster	13948	In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they'd like to do.	0
ClaimBuster	13949	One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent.	0
ClaimBuster	13950	And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office.	0
ClaimBuster	13951	It was due to go bankrupt in 1999 and that 50 million figure again, the newspapers -- I said -- you said forget the journalists, but they are the keepers of the score card and whether or not you're using facts that aren't right.	1
ClaimBuster	13952	Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may.	0
ClaimBuster	13953	Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars.	0
ClaimBuster	13954	I have supported the Administration's position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct.	0
ClaimBuster	13955	But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	13956	An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	13957	We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs we're losing overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	13958	I regret what's happened in these past months.	0
ClaimBuster	13959	And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.	0
ClaimBuster	13960	And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.	1
ClaimBuster	13961	I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	13962	My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War.	1
ClaimBuster	13963	The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.	1
ClaimBuster	13964	And if you want a tough President who uses that strength to get arms control and draws the line in the heavens, vote for Walter Mondale.	0
ClaimBuster	13965	And it's great to be with you again.	0
ClaimBuster	13966	And then all the liberal columnists join in.	0
ClaimBuster	13967	This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself.	0
ClaimBuster	13968	Instead of listening to him, they retired him.	1
ClaimBuster	13969	It's a $1 million loan.	1
ClaimBuster	13970	We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact.	0
ClaimBuster	13971	It was fortunately stopped in its tracks.	1
ClaimBuster	13972	We will continue to stay on the offense.	0
ClaimBuster	13973	I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.	0
ClaimBuster	13974	We organized the Friends of Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	13975	Well I -- I absolutely believe that America has a -- a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that -- that make the world more peaceful.	0
ClaimBuster	13976	I mentioned health care earlier.	1
ClaimBuster	13977	And we're on the hunt for him.	1
ClaimBuster	13978	There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	13979	But I think our hold uh - of support among those who uh - are crucial to the election has been fairly steady.	0
ClaimBuster	13980	And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether it's Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is.	0
ClaimBuster	13981	I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get.	0
ClaimBuster	13982	But I think it was a terrible thing to say.	0
ClaimBuster	13983	I'm a son of Detroit.	1
ClaimBuster	13984	So here's what I would do.	0
ClaimBuster	13985	They interviewed all of my children's friends from childhood on.	1
ClaimBuster	13986	And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.	0
ClaimBuster	13987	But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	13988	Let me also say, we're having an election today.	1
ClaimBuster	13989	I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century.	1
ClaimBuster	13990	If you're middle income, you're about where you were.	0
ClaimBuster	13991	Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.	0
ClaimBuster	13992	If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	13993	And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.	0
ClaimBuster	13994	We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer.	0
ClaimBuster	13995	The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.	1
ClaimBuster	13996	I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	13997	And we will do it with the highest moral principles.	0
ClaimBuster	13998	I would be interested to see if he would say this evening he'll put Medicare in a lockbox.	0
ClaimBuster	13999	We've got, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business.	0
ClaimBuster	14000	The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.	1
ClaimBuster	14001	And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.	0
ClaimBuster	14002	We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	14003	I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	14004	You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.	0
ClaimBuster	14005	Create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	14006	And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	14007	And let the world know - that's very important.	0
ClaimBuster	14008	But I would like to shift, if I could, to the big issue of education.	0
ClaimBuster	14009	Hey, I've got to answer that, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	14010	It's just the right position to take.	0
ClaimBuster	14011	But when you keep star-warring it -- I never suggested where the weapons should be or what kind; I'm not a scientist.	1
ClaimBuster	14012	But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.	0
ClaimBuster	14013	We're going to have to do some things that are quite costly.	0
ClaimBuster	14014	These are a few of the things to which our nation is committed, and we will continue with these commitments.	0
ClaimBuster	14015	But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	14016	So that's how I've used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region.	1
ClaimBuster	14017	It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	14018	You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	14019	I think the administration did the right thing in that case.	0
ClaimBuster	14020	We believe that we had also promised that we would make our country more secure.	0
ClaimBuster	14021	That's why I strongly supported the Motor Voter law.	1
ClaimBuster	14022	And what's that going to do?	0
ClaimBuster	14023	The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.	0
ClaimBuster	14024	So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though.	0
ClaimBuster	14025	And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.	1
ClaimBuster	14026	And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies.	0
ClaimBuster	14027	Now, Senator Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions.	0
ClaimBuster	14028	And judgment is what we look for in the president of the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	14029	So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience.	0
ClaimBuster	14030	Let's talk about programs for children.	0
ClaimBuster	14031	I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.	0
ClaimBuster	14032	We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh - a great many uh - allegations of wrong-doing, of uh - alleged immorality, uh - those are very disturbing to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	14033	Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	14034	I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.	0
ClaimBuster	14035	And, as well, we're pursuing a strategy of freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror.	0
ClaimBuster	14036	Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.	0
ClaimBuster	14037	And if it is, I appreciate it congratulate you.	0
ClaimBuster	14038	Every free economy has good regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	14039	We've had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	14040	If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach.	0
ClaimBuster	14041	Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?	0
ClaimBuster	14042	You know, it's so easy now to say, hey, cut out foreign aid, we got a problem at home.	0
ClaimBuster	14043	They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.	1
ClaimBuster	14044	Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.	1
ClaimBuster	14045	So our troops will come home at that point.	1
ClaimBuster	14046	If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator -- government wants -- Senator Obama wants government to do the job.	1
ClaimBuster	14047	You know he calls it an outsourcing to keep -- stop outsourcing.	0
ClaimBuster	14048	That's where the problem is and I hope there'll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	14049	But I couldn't completely neglect the beauty around me -- the Pacific out there on one side of the highway, shining in the sunlight, the mountains of the coast range rising on the other side.	0
ClaimBuster	14050	We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.	0
ClaimBuster	14051	But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.	0
ClaimBuster	14052	And the way to defeat them long-term, by the way, is to spread freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	14053	That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.	0
ClaimBuster	14054	Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.	0
ClaimBuster	14055	And I don't want to see the banks let off the hook.	0
ClaimBuster	14056	If I couldn't cut taxes and balance the budget the same time, I wouldn't look at you in the eye in your living room or wherever you might be and say that this is good for America.	0
ClaimBuster	14057	And here's my tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	14058	It's a matter of morality.	0
ClaimBuster	14059	And then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.	0
ClaimBuster	14060	They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.	0
ClaimBuster	14061	And that means, for example, standing up for human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	14062	Give me a chance to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	14063	It's a very sacred contract, and I believe in it.	0
ClaimBuster	14064	That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.	0
ClaimBuster	14065	I'm sure that you appreciate that.	0
ClaimBuster	14066	And the schools that are not chosen are improved -- competition does that.	0
ClaimBuster	14067	And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.	0
ClaimBuster	14068	I understand that I can get this country on track again.	0
ClaimBuster	14069	And the last thing I wanna make is this.	0
ClaimBuster	14070	I've seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that's had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever.	1
ClaimBuster	14071	But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.	1
ClaimBuster	14072	I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	14073	So I'm satisfied with it.	0
ClaimBuster	14074	He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	14075	I was on the world of business for 25 years.	1
ClaimBuster	14076	I've been saying that for over a year now.	1
ClaimBuster	14077	The vice president thinks it's the government's money.	0
ClaimBuster	14078	But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school.	0
ClaimBuster	14079	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.	1
ClaimBuster	14080	I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.	0
ClaimBuster	14081	The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they've been getting it.	0
ClaimBuster	14082	Now also, with regard to the figures about California.	0
ClaimBuster	14083	This is particularly true of the recent efforts to shut down part of Alaska.	1
ClaimBuster	14084	And I don't intend to politicize it.	0
ClaimBuster	14085	I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	14086	I don't believe it does.	0
ClaimBuster	14087	I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right.	0
ClaimBuster	14088	All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	14089	Mr. Vice President, thank you very much, and I would like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest, and I want to thank you all for listening.	0
ClaimBuster	14090	Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.	1
ClaimBuster	14091	If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.	0
ClaimBuster	14092	I do know what affirmative action means.	0
ClaimBuster	14093	I think the foremost (Applause)	0
ClaimBuster	14094	The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you.	0
ClaimBuster	14095	They don't let me get away with anything.	0
ClaimBuster	14096	We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make.	0
ClaimBuster	14097	And I've had a consistent record ever since 1965.	1
ClaimBuster	14098	Former Governor Racicot, as chairman of the Republican Party, said he thought that the Patriot Act has to be changed and fixed.	1
ClaimBuster	14099	Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without.	0
ClaimBuster	14100	Let's put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them.	0
ClaimBuster	14101	Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	14102	We are the sole remaining superpower, and we should be that.	0
ClaimBuster	14103	I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.	1
ClaimBuster	14104	Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.	1
ClaimBuster	14105	It's well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration.	1
ClaimBuster	14106	The president says that I'm denigrating these troops.	1
ClaimBuster	14107	The plan says there will be elections in January, and there will be.	1
ClaimBuster	14108	Well, thank you for asking your question.	0
ClaimBuster	14109	The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something, because he never did it without the threat of force.	1
ClaimBuster	14110	We still have the strictest air control, or air pollution laws in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	14111	That, to me, was so hurtful.	0
ClaimBuster	14112	Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	14113	I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	14114	We've got to help them.	0
ClaimBuster	14115	You've got to show you're serious in that regard.	0
ClaimBuster	14116	And by two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits.	1
ClaimBuster	14117	I didn't question the man's patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	14118	We're going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy.	0
ClaimBuster	14119	It was $200 billion deficit instead.	1
ClaimBuster	14120	He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	14121	Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing; it's in the zone of dangerous.	1
ClaimBuster	14122	I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for.	1
ClaimBuster	14123	So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.	0
ClaimBuster	14124	Small business--you've got to have capital, you've got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches.	0
ClaimBuster	14125	Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	14126	It would be a game-changer in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	14127	This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with.	0
ClaimBuster	14128	And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.	0
ClaimBuster	14129	We were proud of them.	0
ClaimBuster	14130	I can say this: I do not believe Yassir Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank.	0
ClaimBuster	14131	You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?	0
ClaimBuster	14132	Well, I've listened to both sides, and if they would talk to one another instead of throwing rocks, I think we could get a lot done.	0
ClaimBuster	14133	Senator Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	14134	And as a result, our nation paid a price.	0
ClaimBuster	14135	You were offered a chance to join.	1
ClaimBuster	14136	I'm from a big farm state.	1
ClaimBuster	14137	We have a concept called the New American School Corporation where we're doing exactly that.	1
ClaimBuster	14138	So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.	0
ClaimBuster	14139	I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	14140	But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	14141	Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.	1
ClaimBuster	14142	I'm asking for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	14143	What I would do is to bring in the pension experts of the country, take a look at it, and strengthen the pension requirements further, because it's not just enough to have the guarantee.	0
ClaimBuster	14144	I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	14145	Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.	0
ClaimBuster	14146	And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.	0
ClaimBuster	14147	You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	14148	I've been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we've faced in the last 20-some years.	1
ClaimBuster	14149	I don't know where that money would come from.	0
ClaimBuster	14150	And I've seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that's come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations.	0
ClaimBuster	14151	And I said, what can we do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	14152	You're not going to find a quote from me.	0
ClaimBuster	14153	And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.	0
ClaimBuster	14154	Osama bin Laden doesn't get to decide.	0
ClaimBuster	14155	I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	14156	We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.	0
ClaimBuster	14157	I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.	0
ClaimBuster	14158	And therefore, the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	14159	They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix.	1
ClaimBuster	14160	The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court uh - is gradually changing, and I'm pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh - Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision.	1
ClaimBuster	14161	One bank in uh - Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles.	1
ClaimBuster	14162	Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.	1
ClaimBuster	14163	That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	14164	So I stand with them.	0
ClaimBuster	14165	Mr. President, I'm still speaking.	0
ClaimBuster	14166	But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business.	1
ClaimBuster	14167	But the point is sometimes the action-	0
ClaimBuster	14168	The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	14169	It's something I've worked on for 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	14170	With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	14171	That's the kind of leadership we'll continue to show.	0
ClaimBuster	14172	That's in America's national interest and that will be the case so long as I'm president.	1
ClaimBuster	14173	Stop this business about asking gosh, how old are you?	0
ClaimBuster	14174	A free Iraq will help secure Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	14175	Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now.	0
ClaimBuster	14176	I would certainly uh - not cut out atomic power altogether.	0
ClaimBuster	14177	I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who.	0
ClaimBuster	14178	I believe Palestinians ought to have a state, but I know they need leadership that's committed to a democracy and freedom, leadership that would be willing to reject terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	14179	Clearly nobody's going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages.	0
ClaimBuster	14180	I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...	0
ClaimBuster	14181	Think of your dreams as a child and ask yourself, isn't it time to stop talking about it?	0
ClaimBuster	14182	We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.	0
ClaimBuster	14183	It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.	0
ClaimBuster	14184	It's not being taken away from anybody else, except we'll downsize the Department of Education.	0
ClaimBuster	14185	We will make some gains in the United States Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	14186	And he went out and he did it.	1
ClaimBuster	14187	Charter schools aren't the only answer, but they're providing competition.	0
ClaimBuster	14188	We need decisions made on sound principles.	0
ClaimBuster	14189	Let's not let them fool with it anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	14190	Our allies know, -- they're not certain what we're going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	14191	Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that.	1
ClaimBuster	14192	That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.	0
ClaimBuster	14193	... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.	0
ClaimBuster	14194	But one of the things we've learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether it's in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes.	0
ClaimBuster	14195	Then companies won't come here.	0
ClaimBuster	14196	If the Vice President of the United States thinks that Robert Bork was an outstanding appointment (Cheers and Applause)	0
ClaimBuster	14197	I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue.	0
ClaimBuster	14198	We're spending a third more on all of the -- well, all of the programs of human service.	1
ClaimBuster	14199	Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	14200	We'll never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands to protect themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	14201	I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	14202	For one thing, let me just follow up here.	0
ClaimBuster	14203	So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice.	0
ClaimBuster	14204	Thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	14205	And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.	0
ClaimBuster	14206	It's completely out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	14207	But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia.	1
ClaimBuster	14208	The wages of Americans have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	14209	That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there.	1
ClaimBuster	14210	Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.	0
ClaimBuster	14211	We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.	1
ClaimBuster	14212	Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years.	0
ClaimBuster	14213	You're going to have to watch it.	0
ClaimBuster	14214	Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.	0
ClaimBuster	14215	I'm the last one, right?	0
ClaimBuster	14216	"We're telling other people, ""You can't have nuclear weapons,"" but we're pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using."	1
ClaimBuster	14217	"Say, ""Look, here's what we can do."	0
ClaimBuster	14218	Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.	0
ClaimBuster	14219	Why do we start things that we know the Soviets will match and make us all less secure?	0
ClaimBuster	14220	He said that a fish rots from the head down as he was going after Ed Meese.	1
ClaimBuster	14221	Every time you do that you take a risk.	0
ClaimBuster	14222	It was a promise for less government and less taxes and more freedom for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	14223	But I'm also a serious guy.	0
ClaimBuster	14224	I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich.	0
ClaimBuster	14225	You were promised a middle-class tax cut in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	14226	The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	14227	So we've got to innovate through school choice.	0
ClaimBuster	14228	We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that.	1
ClaimBuster	14229	It wasn't created as a welfare program.	1
ClaimBuster	14230	Just to uh - correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	14231	It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney.	1
ClaimBuster	14232	They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York.	1
ClaimBuster	14233	I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas.	0
ClaimBuster	14234	I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.	0
ClaimBuster	14235	And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that's why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.	1
ClaimBuster	14236	And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.	0
ClaimBuster	14237	The Wall Street Journal said your numbers don't add up.	1
ClaimBuster	14238	Let's talk about military spending, and that's this.	0
ClaimBuster	14239	I've campaigned on this since the primaries.	1
ClaimBuster	14240	What I've said is that we have to store it safely.	1
ClaimBuster	14241	What do we do then?	0
ClaimBuster	14242	This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not.	1
ClaimBuster	14243	I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.	0
ClaimBuster	14244	"When I say ""phony spirit,"" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say."	0
ClaimBuster	14245	I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay.	1
ClaimBuster	14246	And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person.	1
ClaimBuster	14247	But when he's asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close?	0
ClaimBuster	14248	The Senate Budget Committee --	0
ClaimBuster	14249	But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	14250	And I just think that we ought to do everything we can to respect the American family.	0
ClaimBuster	14251	Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.	0
ClaimBuster	14252	And where it's been done, those schools, like in Rochester, those schools that weren't chosen find that they then compete and do better.	1
ClaimBuster	14253	We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children's futures.	0
ClaimBuster	14254	You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.	0
ClaimBuster	14255	I think that we could not afford not to do these things.	0
ClaimBuster	14256	In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime - provided they are anti-Batista.	1
ClaimBuster	14257	He is -- listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids.	1
ClaimBuster	14258	But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded.	0
ClaimBuster	14259	And the answer is, no, I will not have a litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	14260	You can't do it with the school bureaucracy controlling everything and that's why we have a new program that I hope people have heard about.	0
ClaimBuster	14261	What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse?	0
ClaimBuster	14262	No, I don't, because I think that America has to stand with democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	14263	One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.	0
ClaimBuster	14264	Well, Aleppo is a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	14265	You were very clear that you would not provide, government assistance to the U.S. auto companies, even if they went through bankruptcy.	1
ClaimBuster	14266	Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.	0
ClaimBuster	14267	And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan.	1
ClaimBuster	14268	I just can't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	14269	Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care.	0
ClaimBuster	14270	And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost.	1
ClaimBuster	14271	He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford.	1
ClaimBuster	14272	It's ruining us in trade.	0
ClaimBuster	14273	And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter.	1
ClaimBuster	14274	And he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections.	1
ClaimBuster	14275	Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	14276	The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate.	1
ClaimBuster	14277	During the last five years, Texas's government has gone up in size.	1
ClaimBuster	14278	Sometimes he has to act.	0
ClaimBuster	14279	We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11.	1
ClaimBuster	14280	I believe that it's accurate to say that - that the - that the committees to whom you refer with the - the employment that you uh - state, and with the 5 to 5 and a half percent growth rate in our economy, that the uh - projections would be a uh - a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we'd have to spend in l981 compared to now.	1
ClaimBuster	14281	That's why I'm proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14282	Iran now and Russia are now against us.	1
ClaimBuster	14283	If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.	0
ClaimBuster	14284	What the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies.	0
ClaimBuster	14285	And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women's pay.	1
ClaimBuster	14286	We have to restore trust.	0
ClaimBuster	14287	So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line.	0
ClaimBuster	14288	I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000.	0
ClaimBuster	14289	It was a superb occasion.	0
ClaimBuster	14290	One of our first officers was a woman, the chief financial officer.	1
ClaimBuster	14291	The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems.	1
ClaimBuster	14292	Asia will be our largest trading partner in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	14293	We have an adversarial relationship that's destroying jobs and sending them overseas while we have the finest workers in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	14294	It's not good to raise the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	14295	And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...	0
ClaimBuster	14296	If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty.	1
ClaimBuster	14297	We cannot pay off the $4 trillion debt, balance the budget and have the industries of the future and the high- paying jobs in this country without having the revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	14298	I believe we can set our priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	14299	Governor Rockefeller says five per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	14300	Your future benefits would be cut by the amount that's diverted into the stock market.	1
ClaimBuster	14301	In fact, he doubled it.	1
ClaimBuster	14302	And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.	0
ClaimBuster	14303	Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated.	1
ClaimBuster	14304	I think that would help.	0
ClaimBuster	14305	"You've got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, ""I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter."""	0
ClaimBuster	14306	Our d- security depends upon Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	14307	Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?	0
ClaimBuster	14308	I heard more of the same.	0
ClaimBuster	14309	They have to include the other countries of Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	14310	And not about personal things.	0
ClaimBuster	14311	That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	14312	I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	14313	We are a force of good in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	14314	When you came to office 32 million people on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	14315	We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.	1
ClaimBuster	14316	Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear.	0
ClaimBuster	14317	The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.	1
ClaimBuster	14318	Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.	1
ClaimBuster	14319	The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	14320	This is wrong, and we have to do something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	14321	No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.	0
ClaimBuster	14322	It was a remarkable event.	1
ClaimBuster	14323	And the best America is not behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	14324	We did propose a regulation six months after I became President under the law he mentioned.	1
ClaimBuster	14325	It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	14326	I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	14327	Oh, there were occasional snipings and sometimes some artillery fire, but we did not engage in conflict that was out of line with our mission.	0
ClaimBuster	14328	And that will be as bad as NAFTA.	0
ClaimBuster	14329	That I can tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	14330	There's too many issues left unresolved.	0
ClaimBuster	14331	Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	14332	This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	14333	I will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	14334	There were other issues associated with this -- with this tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	14335	Look, the problem is that under Governor Bush's plan, $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined.	1
ClaimBuster	14336	Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond.	0
ClaimBuster	14337	Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.	1
ClaimBuster	14338	My opponent said this is a bitterly divided time.	1
ClaimBuster	14339	"I remember the vice president saying, ""Just give us a chance to get up there, we're going to make sure you get tax cuts."""	1
ClaimBuster	14340	But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.	1
ClaimBuster	14341	The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.	0
ClaimBuster	14342	I think we have been right in carrying it.	0
ClaimBuster	14343	We need more work on value-added processing.	0
ClaimBuster	14344	That's 16 million jobs in America.	1
ClaimBuster	14345	But it was also military.	1
ClaimBuster	14346	I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.	1
ClaimBuster	14347	Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating?	0
ClaimBuster	14348	You are going to drive business out.	0
ClaimBuster	14349	You can't do that as president.	0
ClaimBuster	14350	I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide.	0
ClaimBuster	14351	"When you give us access, we'll give you access."""	0
ClaimBuster	14352	You've bought a front row box seat and you're not happy with your health care and you're saying tonight we've got bad health care but very expensive health care.	0
ClaimBuster	14353	He's the one that brought up, to garner primary votes, the whole question of the ACLU.	0
ClaimBuster	14354	And he was a risk that -- and this is where we just have a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	14355	And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.	1
ClaimBuster	14356	I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	14357	And we have weakened our position in NATO because the other countries in Europe supported the democ- democratic forces in Portugal long before we did; we stuck to the Portugal dictatorships much longer than other democracies did in this world.	1
ClaimBuster	14358	The situation today cries out for bipartisanship.	0
ClaimBuster	14359	Well, if you watched my television show the other night, you saw it.	0
ClaimBuster	14360	And that's the kind of judge I'm going to put on there.	0
ClaimBuster	14361	Four, we're going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade.	0
ClaimBuster	14362	It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.	0
ClaimBuster	14363	They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	14364	Jim, if I could just respond.	0
ClaimBuster	14365	And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means.	0
ClaimBuster	14366	In terms of in response to the question, no.	0
ClaimBuster	14367	And I believe you're right on to something, that if we don't change the education we're not going to be able to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	14368	I have a plan to put people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	14369	Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space.	1
ClaimBuster	14370	I understand what the president is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat.	0
ClaimBuster	14371	Tipper and I have been married for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	14372	That's the kind of defense program that uh - Mr. Carter wants.	1
ClaimBuster	14373	But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	14374	Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking.	0
ClaimBuster	14375	I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward.	0
ClaimBuster	14376	You know, my friends, my parents came to this country as immigrants like millions and millions of Americans before them and since, seeking opportunities, seeking the American dream.	1
ClaimBuster	14377	There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now.	1
ClaimBuster	14378	We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	14379	He promised -- he -- you know -- let me just say --	1
ClaimBuster	14380	That was more than a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	14381	Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh - the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	14382	Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.	1
ClaimBuster	14383	Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.	0
ClaimBuster	14384	I've worked on this issue.	1
ClaimBuster	14385	And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	14386	I don't look on it personally as relevant, and I consider it really a waste of time tonight, when you consider the issues that face our country right now.	0
ClaimBuster	14387	And the president has chosen a policy that makes it impossible for our scientists to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	14388	Nobody's been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	14389	The federal government puts about 6% of the money up.	1
ClaimBuster	14390	Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that.	0
ClaimBuster	14391	Therefore, you don't know what's it like.	0
ClaimBuster	14392	They sent me a picture of her in the classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	14393	That's what the question in this campaign is about.	0
ClaimBuster	14394	President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.	1
ClaimBuster	14395	I did not say that.	1
ClaimBuster	14396	Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	14397	And we need law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	14398	And when I am re-elected, I believe one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress not beholden to the old ways to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesn't put a lot of inhibitions on it, and protects the depositors through keeping the FDIC sound.	0
ClaimBuster	14399	I'll close on this point.	0
ClaimBuster	14400	How about Sandra Day O'Connor as an example?	0
ClaimBuster	14401	It's against my political interest to say go ahead and go along with the tax increase, but I did what I thought was right at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	14402	We don't have inflation because the people are living too well.	0
ClaimBuster	14403	We have made good progress, and there is no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic party since ancient history in this country's political life are a very important element of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	14404	First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	14405	Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.	1
ClaimBuster	14406	And community colleges are on the job.	1
ClaimBuster	14407	Now if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt that's already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more, and if we continue with this for another four years, then I'm worried about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation around.	1
ClaimBuster	14408	In my view that's going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	14409	I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.	0
ClaimBuster	14410	We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere.	0
ClaimBuster	14411	A governor gets to name supreme court judges.	1
ClaimBuster	14412	That's -- that's important, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	14413	And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now.	1
ClaimBuster	14414	And I think that's that's the thrust we will make.	0
ClaimBuster	14415	Ninety-eight percent of America, I'm giving you a tax cut and I'm giving you health care.	1
ClaimBuster	14416	One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make.	0
ClaimBuster	14417	That's not the role of a president to decide right and wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	14418	And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?	0
ClaimBuster	14419	The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	14420	We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	14421	What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.	0
ClaimBuster	14422	So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.	0
ClaimBuster	14423	Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.	1
ClaimBuster	14424	We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.	0
ClaimBuster	14425	The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high.	1
ClaimBuster	14426	Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.	1
ClaimBuster	14427	King Abdullah of Jordan said just yesterday or the day before you can't hold elections in Iraq with the chaos that's going on today.	1
ClaimBuster	14428	Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	14429	I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	14430	Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.	1
ClaimBuster	14431	And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations.	1
ClaimBuster	14432	I agree our military is the strongest in the world today, that's not the question.	1
ClaimBuster	14433	The interest rates are based on inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	14434	I'm trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission.	1
ClaimBuster	14435	I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where there's a genocide, where our national security is at stake there.	0
ClaimBuster	14436	We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing.	1
ClaimBuster	14437	And so I think when you look at those results, you know the plan I've laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you'll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	14438	This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.	0
ClaimBuster	14439	I would meet with the leaders of the Congress, with all the newly elected members of the Congress and as many others with whom I could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration, and we would present a jobs program.	0
ClaimBuster	14440	All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes.	0
ClaimBuster	14441	No, and I have to (Applause)	0
ClaimBuster	14442	I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.	0
ClaimBuster	14443	And we've been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	14444	I met that woman again.	1
ClaimBuster	14445	If he wants to start, he can start.	0
ClaimBuster	14446	I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked.	1
ClaimBuster	14447	However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	14448	But I am asking for your help and assistance to be president for the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	14449	Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace?	0
ClaimBuster	14450	Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.	1
ClaimBuster	14451	And we're in real trouble on that.	0
ClaimBuster	14452	I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.	0
ClaimBuster	14453	So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in.	0
ClaimBuster	14454	I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.	0
ClaimBuster	14455	So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	14456	And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.	0
ClaimBuster	14457	I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	14458	Who do you want to start with?	0
ClaimBuster	14459	17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies.	1
ClaimBuster	14460	Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.	1
ClaimBuster	14461	I think it's -- before I came in, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer.	1
ClaimBuster	14462	And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts.	0
ClaimBuster	14463	Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country.	0
ClaimBuster	14464	Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.	1
ClaimBuster	14465	Yours is phased in in eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	14466	Now, let me tell you what I favor instead.	0
ClaimBuster	14467	Thirty years ago, there were three policemen for every crime.	1
ClaimBuster	14468	This puts us on a road to Greece.	0
ClaimBuster	14469	Get a variety of choices to make in their lives.	0
ClaimBuster	14470	Now, I just believe that what we have to do is enforce the civil rights laws.	0
ClaimBuster	14471	I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	14472	When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue.	1
ClaimBuster	14473	And that's where the President's failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly.	0
ClaimBuster	14474	And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.	1
ClaimBuster	14475	Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed.	0
ClaimBuster	14476	Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend.	1
ClaimBuster	14477	We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	14478	We're going as fast as the experts say we should.	1
ClaimBuster	14479	That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	14480	It's three times bigger than what President Clinton proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	14481	What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.	0
ClaimBuster	14482	The record shows that I'm right.	1
ClaimBuster	14483	I would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil.	0
ClaimBuster	14484	And some people in high positions of leadership, tell us that the answer is to retreat.	0
ClaimBuster	14485	The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	14486	They're seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up.	1
ClaimBuster	14487	So don't tell me about words.	0
ClaimBuster	14488	Well, I'm saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past.	1
ClaimBuster	14489	First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.	1
ClaimBuster	14490	I have seen Cuba go to the Communists.	1
ClaimBuster	14491	But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.	1
ClaimBuster	14492	So these are the differences.	0
ClaimBuster	14493	But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	14494	And I will continue working with him over the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	14495	Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.	0
ClaimBuster	14496	And the Russians need to understand that.	0
ClaimBuster	14497	Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.	0
ClaimBuster	14498	And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.	0
ClaimBuster	14499	And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	14500	The Soviet Union is no more, and now we're working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed -- through cooperation, Ross -- it worked with cooperation, and you're for that, I'm sure, helping Russia become democratic.	1
ClaimBuster	14501	And she ended up living alone by choice.	1
ClaimBuster	14502	But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	14503	We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries saying people can't be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when they've just had babies.	1
ClaimBuster	14504	That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.	0
ClaimBuster	14505	It works particularly when we pay our troops well.	0
ClaimBuster	14506	And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.	0
ClaimBuster	14507	The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800.	1
ClaimBuster	14508	I have a tremendous income.	1
ClaimBuster	14509	But what's been happening over the last couple of years is, as we've watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in.	1
ClaimBuster	14510	The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer but not yet safe.	1
ClaimBuster	14511	First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills.	0
ClaimBuster	14512	I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	14513	The means are at question.	0
ClaimBuster	14514	In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail.	1
ClaimBuster	14515	But you have to have some basic ability.	0
ClaimBuster	14516	One press conference he had without sound.	1
ClaimBuster	14517	I said I wasn't perfect.	0
ClaimBuster	14518	Over the next four years, we'll continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	14519	His experience didn't prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama.	0
ClaimBuster	14520	You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean.	0
ClaimBuster	14521	The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point.	1
ClaimBuster	14522	The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	14523	I believe Governor Romney is a good man.	0
ClaimBuster	14524	Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.	1
ClaimBuster	14525	We proposed and passed a healthy forest bill which was essential to working with -- particularly in Western states -- to make sure that our forests were protected.	1
ClaimBuster	14526	I want to invest in hard-working families.	0
ClaimBuster	14527	That has been their priority.	0
ClaimBuster	14528	Or, alternatively, it's got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that -- that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.	0
ClaimBuster	14529	We gave them ample time.	0
ClaimBuster	14530	And now this economy is growing.	1
ClaimBuster	14531	Who threatens freedom in the world?	0
ClaimBuster	14532	General Colin Powell said the same thing, he fears the initiative would take away the extra effort programs.	1
ClaimBuster	14533	We ought to make them disclose the people they've given money to when they're testifying before congressional committees; we ought to close the lawyers' loopholes; they ought to have to disclose when they're really lobbying.	0
ClaimBuster	14534	It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas.	0
ClaimBuster	14535	I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble.	1
ClaimBuster	14536	I could do that very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	14537	I'm very proud to be the Republican nominee reaching out to Democrats and Independents.	0
ClaimBuster	14538	Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they're going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.	1
ClaimBuster	14539	But if and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing what you're doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons.	0
ClaimBuster	14540	Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	14541	I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.	0
ClaimBuster	14542	If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	14543	And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.	1
ClaimBuster	14544	But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	14545	We created 23 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	14546	Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love.	1
ClaimBuster	14547	And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.	0
ClaimBuster	14548	But we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer.	0
ClaimBuster	14549	And -- and that is part of what's at stake in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	14550	--because the people, not the special interests, put me there.	0
ClaimBuster	14551	Children across our country don't have health care.	1
ClaimBuster	14552	There's a big difference between the two of us.	0
ClaimBuster	14553	This is the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	14554	And I think that's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	14555	This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez.	1
ClaimBuster	14556	He now wants to take the six-party talks we have -- China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States -- and undermine them by having bilateral talks.	0
ClaimBuster	14557	I believe in our parks.	0
ClaimBuster	14558	Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear.	0
ClaimBuster	14559	So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors' prescription drug program, that says we'll pay for the poor seniors, we'll help all seniors with prescription drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	14560	And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	14561	Let me make one other point.	0
ClaimBuster	14562	I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this.	1
ClaimBuster	14563	You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.	0
ClaimBuster	14564	And so let's do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top.	0
ClaimBuster	14565	I would hope I never have to.	0
ClaimBuster	14566	And now we see beheadings.	1
ClaimBuster	14567	We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.	0
ClaimBuster	14568	They avoided even the advice of their own general.	1
ClaimBuster	14569	I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific.	0
ClaimBuster	14570	Their ideas is to raise taxes and spend more money.	0
ClaimBuster	14571	Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.	0
ClaimBuster	14572	The trends before we -- before I got my current job were on the decline, the number of divisions were reduced.	1
ClaimBuster	14573	And I'm going to offer it to America.	0
ClaimBuster	14574	You've had your chance, Vice President, you've been there for eight years and nothing has been done.	1
ClaimBuster	14575	But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, we've affected the world in a positive way.	0
ClaimBuster	14576	They exiled some, they jailed some, they murdered some.	1
ClaimBuster	14577	And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	14578	We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing.	1
ClaimBuster	14579	We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops.	1
ClaimBuster	14580	He's just not credible when he talks about being fiscally conservative.	0
ClaimBuster	14581	Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.	1
ClaimBuster	14582	And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.	0
ClaimBuster	14583	We can store and we can reprocess.	0
ClaimBuster	14584	Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.	1
ClaimBuster	14585	And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.	0
ClaimBuster	14586	Well, I wasn't the one having trouble explaining it.	1
ClaimBuster	14587	Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.	0
ClaimBuster	14588	But look what's happened to the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	14589	Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time.	0
ClaimBuster	14590	And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program.	1
ClaimBuster	14591	The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	14592	Not one of them selected a Communist government.	1
ClaimBuster	14593	I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	14594	First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	14595	We're going to go forward with the Stealth and the D-5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	14596	And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors.	0
ClaimBuster	14597	I love the fact that people will listen to a guy with a bad accent and a poor presentation manner talking about flip charts for 30 minutes, because they want the details.	0
ClaimBuster	14598	Plus, we need fiscal discipline.	0
ClaimBuster	14599	So this is going to be an important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	14600	We've got to show moral support for Ukraine.	0
ClaimBuster	14601	If, for example, somebody confesses to the crime and somebody is waiting on death row, there has to be alertness to say wait a minute, have we got the wrong guy?	0
ClaimBuster	14602	What I've done is set priorities and funded them.	1
ClaimBuster	14603	I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way.	1
ClaimBuster	14604	When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?	1
ClaimBuster	14605	When you cut back on defense spending, some people are going to be thrown out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	14606	If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.	0
ClaimBuster	14607	What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	14608	It's not the length of your resume.	0
ClaimBuster	14609	And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.	0
ClaimBuster	14610	These are people that I just happen to know and have a high regard for.	1
ClaimBuster	14611	So I care a lot about this, and I've spent countless hours in schools.	1
ClaimBuster	14612	I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.	1
ClaimBuster	14613	We're just in a period -- we've got to work to bring it -- my opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and I'm glad he did.	1
ClaimBuster	14614	My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with.	0
ClaimBuster	14615	And I believe if we have the option, which scientists tell us we do, of curing Parkinson's, curing diabetes, curing, you know, some kind of a, you know, paraplegic or quadriplegic or, you know, a spinal cord injury, anything, that's the nature of the human spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	14616	But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	14617	A president can't be all things to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	14618	Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the United States -- will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	14619	Now, it may very well be here in December you'll hear me say, I think there's a safe way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	14620	Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.	1
ClaimBuster	14621	The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	14622	We can help build coalitions but we can't put our troops all around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	14623	Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	14624	Let me ask a simple question.	0
ClaimBuster	14625	Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.	0
ClaimBuster	14626	As a matter of fact, the tools now given to the terrorist fighters are the same tools that we've been using against drug dealers and white-collar criminals.	1
ClaimBuster	14627	I don't think that's right.	0
ClaimBuster	14628	He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.	1
ClaimBuster	14629	And I think that this is so important.	0
ClaimBuster	14630	You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	14631	Well, can I answer that?	0
ClaimBuster	14632	I will pay down the national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	14633	I finally got 'em for 12 to 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	14634	There is a separation there.	0
ClaimBuster	14635	We should do it in phases.	0
ClaimBuster	14636	That's why we've kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal.	0
ClaimBuster	14637	Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?	0
ClaimBuster	14638	The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working.	1
ClaimBuster	14639	And then I brought folks together to get it done.	1
ClaimBuster	14640	It is the single greatest threat that this country has.	0
ClaimBuster	14641	There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.	1
ClaimBuster	14642	Millions and millions of Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	14643	Now, that has nothing to do with learning.	0
ClaimBuster	14644	I don't think that's a bad decision.	0
ClaimBuster	14645	The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this.	0
ClaimBuster	14646	And we had sanctioned them.	1
ClaimBuster	14647	I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise -- put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	14648	You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.	1
ClaimBuster	14649	So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	14650	Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools.	0
ClaimBuster	14651	So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did.	0
ClaimBuster	14652	Nobody did any of this with evil intent.	0
ClaimBuster	14653	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.	0
ClaimBuster	14654	That's how they do things.	0
ClaimBuster	14655	The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	14656	So, if it's time for action, I think I have experience that counts.	0
ClaimBuster	14657	It's hundreds of millions of ads.	1
ClaimBuster	14658	It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan.	1
ClaimBuster	14659	The problem is they'll be in china.	0
ClaimBuster	14660	We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.	0
ClaimBuster	14661	So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	14662	He talked about the unemployed.	1
ClaimBuster	14663	And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.	0
ClaimBuster	14664	But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me.	0
ClaimBuster	14665	Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation?	1
ClaimBuster	14666	Now I would not provide a litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	14667	But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.	0
ClaimBuster	14668	Our industrial competitors, who are beating us in competition, spend less and have better health care.	1
ClaimBuster	14669	The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they're paying for those who aren't.	0
ClaimBuster	14670	I want flexibility, and I do you know, these people laugh about the thousand points of light.	0
ClaimBuster	14671	Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.	0
ClaimBuster	14672	Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.	1
ClaimBuster	14673	And it was one of the largest declines in our history.	1
ClaimBuster	14674	Take a look at Aleppo.	0
ClaimBuster	14675	That's money in your pocket.	0
ClaimBuster	14676	I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island.	0
ClaimBuster	14677	It's a good idea, they saw it, they picked it up and put it in theirs, but it's only temporary.	0
ClaimBuster	14678	Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota.	1
ClaimBuster	14679	Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.	1
ClaimBuster	14680	You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes.	0
ClaimBuster	14681	And in this case we can't enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to death.	0
ClaimBuster	14682	It's a great thing for companies to expand.	0
ClaimBuster	14683	If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China.	0
ClaimBuster	14684	So what should we do?	0
ClaimBuster	14685	And I had the will of the people in my state behind me.	1
ClaimBuster	14686	We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.	0
ClaimBuster	14687	That's big government at its best.	0
ClaimBuster	14688	We don't do anything to cut down on peak load requirements.	0
ClaimBuster	14689	I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	14690	We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today.	1
ClaimBuster	14691	That's the kind of leadership we've shown in the region.	1
ClaimBuster	14692	Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	14693	Mr. Stone, I've had to make thousands of decisions since I've been President, serving in the Oval Office.	0
ClaimBuster	14694	Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	14695	I don't anticipate that in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	14696	And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.	0
ClaimBuster	14697	That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.	1
ClaimBuster	14698	In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region.	0
ClaimBuster	14699	Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	14700	Thank you, Jim; thank you, Mr. President; thank everyone for watching and listening.	0
ClaimBuster	14701	And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.	0
ClaimBuster	14702	And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	14703	I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters.	0
ClaimBuster	14704	All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.	1
ClaimBuster	14705	And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	14706	And I never promoted Fannie Mae.	1
ClaimBuster	14707	He's got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run.	1
ClaimBuster	14708	We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign and we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	14709	And I'll keep my word on the economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	14710	I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice.	0
ClaimBuster	14711	I mean, who does that?	0
ClaimBuster	14712	That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	14713	We shouldn't do that.√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬§ That's the kind of Vice President I want.	0
ClaimBuster	14714	But we got to have a knowledge base.	0
ClaimBuster	14715	Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	14716	She failed to get the birth certificate.	1
ClaimBuster	14717	We are going to be thriving again.	0
ClaimBuster	14718	It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	14719	He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.	1
ClaimBuster	14720	So, it does play a part in my life.	0
ClaimBuster	14721	That's why it's essential we hold the line.	0
ClaimBuster	14722	And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh - tremendously.	1
ClaimBuster	14723	But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue.	0
ClaimBuster	14724	Jane, there are a lot of ways to be competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	14725	Thank you, and God bless you.	0
ClaimBuster	14726	In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there.	1
ClaimBuster	14727	And this is happening on a weekly basis.	1
ClaimBuster	14728	"There's easy money out there."""	0
ClaimBuster	14729	I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it.	0
ClaimBuster	14730	It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been.	0
ClaimBuster	14731	And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	14732	But people know where I stand.	0
ClaimBuster	14733	Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money.	0
ClaimBuster	14734	"And I said, ""I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor."""	1
ClaimBuster	14735	And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.	1
ClaimBuster	14736	In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.	1
ClaimBuster	14737	In the last four years, there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created.	1
ClaimBuster	14738	There's a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey.	1
ClaimBuster	14739	I'll never give a veto to any country over our security.	0
ClaimBuster	14740	I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.	0
ClaimBuster	14741	I remember talking by the telephone.	1
ClaimBuster	14742	It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years.	1
ClaimBuster	14743	I have, obviously, supported those efforts that the United States had to go in militarily and I have opposed that I didn't think so.	1
ClaimBuster	14744	He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...	1
ClaimBuster	14745	You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	14746	If you want to hear it, you get it tomorrow night -- you'll hear it tomorrow night.	0
ClaimBuster	14747	That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	14748	We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy.	1
ClaimBuster	14749	Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.	0
ClaimBuster	14750	I have never advocated a Communist government for Italy.	1
ClaimBuster	14751	But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share.	0
ClaimBuster	14752	And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life.	0
ClaimBuster	14753	That's not the way I would have done it.	0
ClaimBuster	14754	That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes.	1
ClaimBuster	14755	They assumed that the uh - inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh - therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh - tried to increase the uh - the tax uh - payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations.	1
ClaimBuster	14756	And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme.	0
ClaimBuster	14757	Now, many of the programs that I'm talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	14758	It's going to blow a hole in the deficit It's going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.	0
ClaimBuster	14759	And if a few more people had gone to the polls and voted in 1968, Hubert Humphrey would have been President; Richard Nixon would not.	0
ClaimBuster	14760	Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14761	Our foreign competitors are doing it; we're not.	1
ClaimBuster	14762	Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in.	1
ClaimBuster	14763	We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.	0
ClaimBuster	14764	Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	14765	Every chairman of the Finance and Ways and Means Committee, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are telling you that.	0
ClaimBuster	14766	We've got to advocate for their membership in NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	14767	Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts.	0
ClaimBuster	14768	I believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded.	0
ClaimBuster	14769	And I think it's very commendable the work she's done on behalf of special needs.	0
ClaimBuster	14770	Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.	1
ClaimBuster	14771	I was taught -- I went to a church school and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are: Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body and your soul, and love your neighbor as yourself.	1
ClaimBuster	14772	Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.	0
ClaimBuster	14773	Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you.	0
ClaimBuster	14774	The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.	0
ClaimBuster	14775	We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.	0
ClaimBuster	14776	The first president in 72 years to lose jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	14777	Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	14778	There is a tax loophole right now.	1
ClaimBuster	14779	I will release my tax returns.	0
ClaimBuster	14780	Now that was quite an admission.	0
ClaimBuster	14781	And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities.	0
ClaimBuster	14782	"I think there's an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we're in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: ""We have it in our power to begin the world over again.''"	0
ClaimBuster	14783	And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.	0
ClaimBuster	14784	It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.	0
ClaimBuster	14785	And we were warned 5 days before that explosives were on their way, and they weren't taken.	1
ClaimBuster	14786	Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.	0
ClaimBuster	14787	The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.	0
ClaimBuster	14788	Would he have started a war?	0
ClaimBuster	14789	But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.	1
ClaimBuster	14790	I'm going to make the state do this and make the state do that.	0
ClaimBuster	14791	And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	14792	He was going to break it up because he would - knew that he wasn't going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference.	0
ClaimBuster	14793	By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills.	0
ClaimBuster	14794	If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows.	0
ClaimBuster	14795	It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.	0
ClaimBuster	14796	And I don't think anybody has a call on people in their Administrations going astray.	0
ClaimBuster	14797	Some of our troops are not well-equipped.	1
ClaimBuster	14798	"How could you be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and have some kid say -- when you have to make a tough decision, as I did in Panama or Kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say, ""Well, I'm not going to go."	0
ClaimBuster	14799	I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.	0
ClaimBuster	14800	And I lower the cost of health care in the way that I described to you.	1
ClaimBuster	14801	And -- and attacking me is not an agenda.	0
ClaimBuster	14802	Now, look, I'm just kind of a, you know, cur dog here; I was put on the ballot by the people, not special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	14803	He didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President.	1
ClaimBuster	14804	So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.	0
ClaimBuster	14805	He says mistakes were made.	0
ClaimBuster	14806	We have peace with freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	14807	In Libya we stood on the side of the people.	1
ClaimBuster	14808	Now, Senator Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don't think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's economy.	0
ClaimBuster	14809	He came and asked for a tax cut -- we wanted a tax cut to kick the economy into gear.	1
ClaimBuster	14810	My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.	0
ClaimBuster	14811	Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say we're going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet because his figures don't add up and he's going to sock it right to the middle class taxpayer and lower, if he's going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes.	1
ClaimBuster	14812	My school choice program, GI Bill for Kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools.	1
ClaimBuster	14813	And I'll stop, Tom, and you didn't even wave.	1
ClaimBuster	14814	You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.	1
ClaimBuster	14815	I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.	1
ClaimBuster	14816	I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know who's the person who could be a commander in chief who could get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	14817	We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible.	0
ClaimBuster	14818	Because it's so essential to our economic strength and to our future.	0
ClaimBuster	14819	Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line.	1
ClaimBuster	14820	When you say loud and clear to somebody if you're going to carry a gun illegally, we're going to arrest you.	0
ClaimBuster	14821	This package has transparency in it.	0
ClaimBuster	14822	I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	14823	And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	14824	You've now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials.	0
ClaimBuster	14825	I ask for your support, I ask for your help.	0
ClaimBuster	14826	So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and we're dedicated to the survival and security of Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	14827	We have no energy policy.	1
ClaimBuster	14828	Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.	1
ClaimBuster	14829	But in doing this, we have made sure that we address this question peacefully, not injecting American military forces into combat, but letting the strength of our nation be felt in a beneficial way.	0
ClaimBuster	14830	Candy, there's no doubt that world demand's gone up, but our production is going up, and we're using oil more efficiently.	1
ClaimBuster	14831	And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that I'm going to attack them.	0
ClaimBuster	14832	And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well.	0
ClaimBuster	14833	That's what I've done in Texas and that's the kind of leadership style I'll bring to Washington.	1
ClaimBuster	14834	Here's your fine -- zero.	0
ClaimBuster	14835	And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college.	1
ClaimBuster	14836	We've done so in my own state.	0
ClaimBuster	14837	But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	14838	Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	14839	It doesn't -- under the Medicare plan -- it doesn't help seniors get any better.	0
ClaimBuster	14840	Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America.	0
ClaimBuster	14841	But I'll tell you what he's going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	14842	It seems to me that the Miranda case was a case that really made it very, very difficult for the - uh police, the law enforcement people in this country to uh - do what they could to make certain that the victim of a crime was protected and that those that commit crimes uh - were properly handled and uh - sent to jail.	0
ClaimBuster	14843	This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, someone whose parents didn't finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, someone who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed.	1
ClaimBuster	14844	It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	14845	I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war.	0
ClaimBuster	14846	Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country?	0
ClaimBuster	14847	So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.	0
ClaimBuster	14848	We created 23 million new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	14849	That's what's happening in Iraq, and it wasn't a tactic.	0
ClaimBuster	14850	I'd like the government to have that.	0
ClaimBuster	14851	I'm going to get the training of Iraqis done faster.	0
ClaimBuster	14852	I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things.	0
ClaimBuster	14853	"Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say ""yes"" or ""no."""	0
ClaimBuster	14854	They knew how to ask the American people for the right things.	0
ClaimBuster	14855	That's why I've asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	14856	Well, we'll talk about the tax cut for middle class here in a minute.	0
ClaimBuster	14857	That's what works in other countries and that's what'll work here.	0
ClaimBuster	14858	Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: keep the taxes low, don't increase the scope of the federal government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health- care policy that does not empower the federal government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.	0
ClaimBuster	14859	My plan does a better job.	0
ClaimBuster	14860	You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.	1
ClaimBuster	14861	In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	14862	It's all too easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say oh, we're just all the same, without an understanding of the different life experience that you've had, that others have had.	0
ClaimBuster	14863	I've proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within four years.	0
ClaimBuster	14864	I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.	1
ClaimBuster	14865	I'd love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	14866	And this is not my own -- only my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	14867	And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	14868	I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.	1
ClaimBuster	14869	That you can pass on from one generation to the next.	0
ClaimBuster	14870	These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.	0
ClaimBuster	14871	And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.	1
ClaimBuster	14872	So I don't want you to read my lips and I sure don't want you to read his.	0
ClaimBuster	14873	It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third.	1
ClaimBuster	14874	And, I might add, with the democratic Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	14875	We drove the Russians out with -- the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	14876	Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.	0
ClaimBuster	14877	The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down.	0
ClaimBuster	14878	We shore up the border.	0
ClaimBuster	14879	And you can go out and buy your own insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	14880	It's a matter of being consistent.	0
ClaimBuster	14881	I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.	0
ClaimBuster	14882	I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food.	0
ClaimBuster	14883	That happened to be a recession year.	1
ClaimBuster	14884	No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully.	0
ClaimBuster	14885	And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they're doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region.	1
ClaimBuster	14886	We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.	1
ClaimBuster	14887	They're foreign lobbyists taking leaves.	1
ClaimBuster	14888	I said that I'd end the war in Iraq, and I did.	1
ClaimBuster	14889	I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	14890	I don't think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage.	0
ClaimBuster	14891	Here in the United States, which developed the Tennessee Valley and which built the Grand Coulee and the other dams in the Northwest United States at the present rate of hydropower production - and that is the hallmark of an industrialized society - the Soviet Union by 1975 will be producing more power than we are.	1
ClaimBuster	14892	And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.	1
ClaimBuster	14893	Those people -- I don't know those people.	0
ClaimBuster	14894	The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.	1
ClaimBuster	14895	If you're married, you got tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	14896	We're the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	14897	There's nothing wrong with the theory of it.	0
ClaimBuster	14898	But, again, spending more money isn't always the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	14899	Ah - I'm not uh - sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had - had expressed uh - his concern about the statement or apologized for it.	0
ClaimBuster	14900	It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis.	0
ClaimBuster	14901	But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.	0
ClaimBuster	14902	And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.	0
ClaimBuster	14903	I held off for the applause.	1
ClaimBuster	14904	I want more trade, and I know there are some good things in that agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	14905	It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	14906	In the meantime, we've got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	14907	Thank you very much tonight, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	14908	We've increased Pell Grants by a million students.	1
ClaimBuster	14909	These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.	0
ClaimBuster	14910	And all I can tell you is every day I know that there's people working overtime, doing the very best they can.	0
ClaimBuster	14911	We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.	1
ClaimBuster	14912	When you're attacked for your military record, I immediately said it was inappropriate, it had no place in this campaign, and I rejected it.	1
ClaimBuster	14913	At the same time, we have to make certain that the Soviet Union's Backfire, which they claim is not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend is, must also be included if we are to get the kind of agreement which is in the best interest of both countries.	0
ClaimBuster	14914	We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.	0
ClaimBuster	14915	I don't want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you can't do this any more.	0
ClaimBuster	14916	Obama draws the line in the sand.	0
ClaimBuster	14917	But you can't tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain, with 8,300, and below that the four others are below 4,000, and below that, there isn't anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done.	1
ClaimBuster	14918	Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether he'd be for repealing the Brady Bill or repealing the assault weapons ban.	1
ClaimBuster	14919	We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us.	0
ClaimBuster	14920	But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.	0
ClaimBuster	14921	I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency.	0
ClaimBuster	14922	Exports are down, and every time an export number goes down, it hurts the farmer.	1
ClaimBuster	14923	Uh - He sent a mission - the President - in 1955 of Mr. uh - Robertson and Admiral Radford.	1
ClaimBuster	14924	So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.	0
ClaimBuster	14925	I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	14926	Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred.	1
ClaimBuster	14927	But they don't work if you go raise taxes and then the Congress spends it continues to spend that.	0
ClaimBuster	14928	And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	14929	And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice.	1
ClaimBuster	14930	We've uh - got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	14931	A few days later, Mr. Schlesinger came back and said if we cut the defense budget by three to five billion dollars, we will have to cut military personnel by two hundred and fifty thousand, civilian personnel by a hundred thousand, jobs in America by a hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	14932	It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen.	0
ClaimBuster	14933	That's the highest we've ever been in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	14934	Under your direction, to a large extent.	0
ClaimBuster	14935	Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done.	0
ClaimBuster	14936	Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	14937	Chris, we don't gain anything.	0
ClaimBuster	14938	So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.	0
ClaimBuster	14939	Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	14940	He said all poor seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	14941	One of the reasons for that is that people think it's more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here.	0
ClaimBuster	14942	I know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person.	0
ClaimBuster	14943	But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	14944	I'd like to see those written instructions.	0
ClaimBuster	14945	And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment.	0
ClaimBuster	14946	I don't take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what I've tried to do to work with others to make good things happen.	0
ClaimBuster	14947	Now, here's what that means.	0
ClaimBuster	14948	Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	14949	But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.	0
ClaimBuster	14950	We have not known what we've wanted and we've been out-traded in almost every instance.	0
ClaimBuster	14951	I do not say that.	0
ClaimBuster	14952	So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.	0
ClaimBuster	14953	I supported them when they did so.	1
ClaimBuster	14954	I don't disagree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	14955	Look, this is a man who has great numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	14956	In Texas I tried to do something innovative.	0
ClaimBuster	14957	And it's not that simple, either.	0
ClaimBuster	14958	What did we get for it?	0
ClaimBuster	14959	I'll be against it after the election.	0
ClaimBuster	14960	But are we doing enough in these areas?	0
ClaimBuster	14961	So what I've said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I've done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system.	1
ClaimBuster	14962	And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.	0
ClaimBuster	14963	And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	14964	I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy's proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost.	1
ClaimBuster	14965	And that's the kind of America I want to build.	0
ClaimBuster	14966	... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	1
ClaimBuster	14967	Uh - Mr. Maynard, uh - the record of gun control, whether it's one city or another or in some states, does not show that the registration of a gun, handgun, or the registration of the gun owner, has in any way whatsoever decreased the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime.	1
ClaimBuster	14968	Now, you know, watch this -- listen very carefully to this.	0
ClaimBuster	14969	"So when you hear ""tax the rich,"" Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet."	0
ClaimBuster	14970	My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet.	0
ClaimBuster	14971	... talking about it this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	14972	But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.	1
ClaimBuster	14973	What I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we're facing, if we're going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if we're going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, we're going to have to be able to work together.	0
ClaimBuster	14974	It has not worked the way that it has been promised.	1
ClaimBuster	14975	But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it.	0
ClaimBuster	14976	The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts.	0
ClaimBuster	14977	And I'll just make you one promise, my word is good.	0
ClaimBuster	14978	We're going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported.	0
ClaimBuster	14979	we'd be in a stronger place today.	0
ClaimBuster	14980	I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it's in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years.	0
ClaimBuster	14981	I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	14982	Obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	14983	If we don't build more B-2 bombers in California and we lost about 500,000 jobs out in California, because of this devastation, these big, big cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	14984	The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle income families, now down $4,300 during your term.	1
ClaimBuster	14985	And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then I'll phase in the programs that we've uh - advocated, more slowly.	0
ClaimBuster	14986	But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	14987	My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.	0
ClaimBuster	14988	Let me very briefly give you some examples.	0
ClaimBuster	14989	The fact is that the State Department polls on our prestige and influence around the world have shown such a sharp drop that up till now the State Department has been unwilling to release them.	1
ClaimBuster	14990	If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.	0
ClaimBuster	14991	I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.	0
ClaimBuster	14992	Let me say -- I certainly hope so.	0
ClaimBuster	14993	Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	14994	So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory.	0
ClaimBuster	14995	The Japanese, the British, the French do it.	1
ClaimBuster	14996	You see that, their small car division leaving.	1
ClaimBuster	14997	Yes, we're getting the job done.	1
ClaimBuster	14998	What I'm referring to there is the mutual self-defense provisions that exist in the Inter-American treaty, the so-called Rio Pact, that permits the nations, our friends in that region, to combine to take steps -- diplomatic and otherwise -- to prevent Nicaragua, when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border, to take those steps, whatever they might be, to stop it.	1
ClaimBuster	14999	Now, that's another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	15000	And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say.	0
ClaimBuster	15001	And that's just the way it is.	0
ClaimBuster	15002	His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.	0
ClaimBuster	15003	I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy.	0
ClaimBuster	15004	I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	15005	Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	15006	I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance.	1
ClaimBuster	15007	If you create Noriega, using taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	15008	Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.	0
ClaimBuster	15009	Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday's industries.	0
ClaimBuster	15010	We have achieved extraordinary prosperity.	0
ClaimBuster	15011	But to the issue of Iran, as long as I'm president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.	1
ClaimBuster	15012	Then get off to a flying start in '93 to execute these plans.	0
ClaimBuster	15013	They have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh - added to the minimum tax uh - provision to make all people pay more taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	15014	China, is a huge country, broken into many provinces.	1
ClaimBuster	15015	And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America.	0
ClaimBuster	15016	Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and we're grateful for it.	0
ClaimBuster	15017	That's the most important part of this.	0
ClaimBuster	15018	I want anti-ballistic missile systems to protect ourselves and our allies from a rogue nation that may try to hold us hostage or blackmail our allies and friends.	0
ClaimBuster	15019	What about the Dingle-Norwood bill?	0
ClaimBuster	15020	Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	15021	And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you.	0
ClaimBuster	15022	We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	15023	I saw the winds of hatred divide people and keep the people of my state poorer than they would have been, spiritually and economically.	0
ClaimBuster	15024	You know, that's a tough question and there's a lot of qualified Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	15025	I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his -- his action there.	1
ClaimBuster	15026	And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the -- in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem.	0
ClaimBuster	15027	That was their response to that sort of action.	0
ClaimBuster	15028	That's wonderful, except we have a record to look at.	0
ClaimBuster	15029	We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.	0
ClaimBuster	15030	And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking.	1
ClaimBuster	15031	And I'm happy to tell you that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	15032	And why have they lost their industry?	0
ClaimBuster	15033	And I've got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.	1
ClaimBuster	15034	More than 90% of America's children go to public schools.	1
ClaimBuster	15035	"And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, ""Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''"	1
ClaimBuster	15036	I'm against the partial-birth abortion, but you've got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother.	0
ClaimBuster	15037	I think we've had a very healthy discussion.	0
ClaimBuster	15038	I, too, want to extend my prayers and blessings, God's blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes -- tod -- last night.	0
ClaimBuster	15039	For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called Reinventing Government.	1
ClaimBuster	15040	People who had the money were benefiting.	0
ClaimBuster	15041	The extremes are hurting the AIDS cause.	0
ClaimBuster	15042	Because freedom took hold in that part of the world, but there's a lot of work left to be done, however.	0
ClaimBuster	15043	In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.	1
ClaimBuster	15044	And, Senator Obama, you didn't repudiate those remarks.	1
ClaimBuster	15045	Well, these special kinds of programs have - have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh - eight thousand pages of the tax code.	1
ClaimBuster	15046	That's my big difference with him on the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	15047	Let me give you one example.	0
ClaimBuster	15048	"And I said, ""Well, gosh, can't we -- can't we find some -- some women that are also qualified?"""	0
ClaimBuster	15049	My administration has tripled the amount of money we're spending on homeland security to $30 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	15050	They had thirty-five people on the list.	1
ClaimBuster	15051	Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category?	0
ClaimBuster	15052	This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	15053	And I have a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	15054	And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	15055	Right now there's a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.	1
ClaimBuster	15056	I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.	0
ClaimBuster	15057	We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region.	1
ClaimBuster	15058	We've doubled the number of loans from the small business administration, tripled the number of loans to women business people, no one unqualified, everybody had to meet the standards.	1
ClaimBuster	15059	We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	15060	I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.	0
ClaimBuster	15061	And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.	1
ClaimBuster	15062	I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.	1
ClaimBuster	15063	It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent.	1
ClaimBuster	15064	The American people would be in charge.	0
ClaimBuster	15065	It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process.	0
ClaimBuster	15066	I'd like to answer the question, because I've actually been a governor for 12 years, so I've known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas, and I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports.	1
ClaimBuster	15067	You know, if you are a country and you're trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion.	0
ClaimBuster	15068	Like the old carpenter says measure twice, cut once.	0
ClaimBuster	15069	Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15070	I don't want to hurt their feelings on national TV.	0
ClaimBuster	15071	It's the hardest decision a president makes.	0
ClaimBuster	15072	And that's the kind of America I want.	0
ClaimBuster	15073	"And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying ""Peyton (ph), I love you and I will always watch over you."""	1
ClaimBuster	15074	In fact, women's wages have dropped 2.2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	15075	We have came out of the recession and we're well on the road to real prosperity in this country again.	0
ClaimBuster	15076	We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.	1
ClaimBuster	15077	I've been known to mangle a syl-a-ble or two myself, you know, if you know what I mean.	1
ClaimBuster	15078	Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget.	0
ClaimBuster	15079	And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government.	0
ClaimBuster	15080	I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.	0
ClaimBuster	15081	The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	15082	I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.	0
ClaimBuster	15083	Just no hedges, no ifs, ands and buts.	0
ClaimBuster	15084	I want to do those two things and get this -- get this to a balanced budget with eight -- eight to 10 years.	0
ClaimBuster	15085	I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.	0
ClaimBuster	15086	What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.	1
ClaimBuster	15087	So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants.	0
ClaimBuster	15088	Today it is up a plus 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	15089	I served an a hospital authority.	1
ClaimBuster	15090	One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money.	0
ClaimBuster	15091	Everybody ought to be in this thing.	0
ClaimBuster	15092	And we've -- you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCain's statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound.	1
ClaimBuster	15093	And I've stood up with these people, and I understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation, and it's moving, not as fast as we'd like.	0
ClaimBuster	15094	And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	15095	Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here.	0
ClaimBuster	15096	And what is he going to say to those people that show up at the summit?	0
ClaimBuster	15097	Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	15098	Because they felt that the American society was moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	15099	In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here...	0
ClaimBuster	15100	"The mistake that was made was making the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place just to get elected, knowing what the size of the deficit was."	0
ClaimBuster	15101	I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country.	0
ClaimBuster	15102	You know, I was having lunch with some -- a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances.	1
ClaimBuster	15103	They end up being worse than the people.	0
ClaimBuster	15104	I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.	0
ClaimBuster	15105	One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.	0
ClaimBuster	15106	Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh - propaganda that I've read.	1
ClaimBuster	15107	We're doing that precisely, and I think one thing sooner or later we're going to have to consider is take a look at the Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	15108	Look at the record and make your decision.	0
ClaimBuster	15109	These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America.	0
ClaimBuster	15110	So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	15111	We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not.	0
ClaimBuster	15112	Look, I'm very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as he explains, and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don't go through my subcommittee because they're done as a committee as a whole.	1
ClaimBuster	15113	If we're going to have follow-ups, then I will want follow-ups, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	15114	But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.	1
ClaimBuster	15115	We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	15116	And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970.	1
ClaimBuster	15117	This would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arms race.	0
ClaimBuster	15118	"And if I were to ever say, ""This is the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place,"" the troops would wonder, how can I follow this guy?"	0
ClaimBuster	15119	And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	15120	I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.	0
ClaimBuster	15121	And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	15122	Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.	1
ClaimBuster	15123	But we do have differences.	0
ClaimBuster	15124	I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time...	1
ClaimBuster	15125	They have 270 billion dollars in Medicare cuts the first education cuts in history, cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent, took away the guarantee of quality standards in nursing homes, took away the guarantee of health care for folks with disabilities.	1
ClaimBuster	15126	It brought the crime rate way down.	1
ClaimBuster	15127	Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.	0
ClaimBuster	15128	Obviously the president and I both have very strong convictions.	0
ClaimBuster	15129	And then I went down to the border towns of Storok (ph), which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas.	1
ClaimBuster	15130	You can't take different positions on these difficult issues.	0
ClaimBuster	15131	I voted for border security, and there are...	1
ClaimBuster	15132	So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	15133	That's what I feel passionately about.	0
ClaimBuster	15134	To me that's what it's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	15135	We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America.	0
ClaimBuster	15136	We are the ones that lowered the barrier to products with Carla Hill's negotiation.	1
ClaimBuster	15137	And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school.	1
ClaimBuster	15138	It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages.	0
ClaimBuster	15139	What about the other 15,000?	0
ClaimBuster	15140	But the military -- let's get back to the military, though.	0
ClaimBuster	15141	We're a freedom-loving nation and if we're an arrogant nation they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation they'll respect us.	0
ClaimBuster	15142	I've met parents who've on the Internet gotten the armor to send their kids.	1
ClaimBuster	15143	There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote.	1
ClaimBuster	15144	But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there's some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well.	0
ClaimBuster	15145	Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million.	1
ClaimBuster	15146	They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job.	0
ClaimBuster	15147	Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home.	0
ClaimBuster	15148	You know what the bad news is that follows on that.	0
ClaimBuster	15149	And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it.	1
ClaimBuster	15150	It's easy to say in retrospect I would have done something differently.	0
ClaimBuster	15151	Not what a commander in chief does when you're trying to lead troops.	0
ClaimBuster	15152	In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15153	I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	15154	Well, Margaret, we've heard it again tonight and I'm not surprised, the labels.	0
ClaimBuster	15155	Another thing that I'd like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	15156	They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	15157	We're going to defeat ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	15158	But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.	0
ClaimBuster	15159	Well, I've been governor of a small state for 12 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15160	You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	15161	No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.	1
ClaimBuster	15162	Your question -- your question is one that's being asked by college kids all over this country.	1
ClaimBuster	15163	Did they occur when you were a young person, in your formative years?	0
ClaimBuster	15164	But we have to prove we can pay for them.	0
ClaimBuster	15165	My plan balances the budget within 6 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15166	The best America doesn't leave some of its citizens behind.	0
ClaimBuster	15167	This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.	0
ClaimBuster	15168	I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.	0
ClaimBuster	15169	I just thought of another -- another big difference here between me.	0
ClaimBuster	15170	I think it can be.	0
ClaimBuster	15171	It's time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.	0
ClaimBuster	15172	And, finally, we have to stand by our principles.	0
ClaimBuster	15173	I think we have to come together and work to change it.	0
ClaimBuster	15174	And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	15175	Now, one thing I don't understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?	1
ClaimBuster	15176	The President held it up.	1
ClaimBuster	15177	But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.	0
ClaimBuster	15178	If the American people cannot be brought together, we can't turn this country around.	0
ClaimBuster	15179	You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.	0
ClaimBuster	15180	We've got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time.	0
ClaimBuster	15181	But there are other folks out there.	0
ClaimBuster	15182	Now, I don't want to get into that --	0
ClaimBuster	15183	"And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, ""Go out and shop."""	1
ClaimBuster	15184	He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	15185	Didn't close off the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	15186	When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other.	1
ClaimBuster	15187	I'd like to thank the people of St. Louis and Washington University, the Presidential Debate Commission and all those who made this night possible.	0
ClaimBuster	15188	More money goes to the -- can I have a rebuttal here?	0
ClaimBuster	15189	So this is a national security issue.	0
ClaimBuster	15190	It was very clear this was not a demonstration.	0
ClaimBuster	15191	And if they -- if they find that -- that they can't get the benefits here that they want and they can't -- and they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go a place where -- where they have better opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	15192	Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed.	1
ClaimBuster	15193	And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.	1
ClaimBuster	15194	I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.	0
ClaimBuster	15195	Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.	0
ClaimBuster	15196	We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing.	1
ClaimBuster	15197	Under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up.	0
ClaimBuster	15198	It is to fully fund the McKinney Act.	0
ClaimBuster	15199	It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.	1
ClaimBuster	15200	But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend.	1
ClaimBuster	15201	That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	15202	Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline.	0
ClaimBuster	15203	Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	15204	As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life.	0
ClaimBuster	15205	And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there.	1
ClaimBuster	15206	Will they create jobs in America?	0
ClaimBuster	15207	I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which says you can't lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family's been sick.	1
ClaimBuster	15208	But America cannot stand pat.	0
ClaimBuster	15209	And over the long run they will be more reliable partners.	0
ClaimBuster	15210	But in the presidency, a lot goes into it.	0
ClaimBuster	15211	And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.	0
ClaimBuster	15212	Democrats and Republicans said Bob Dole's word is good.	1
ClaimBuster	15213	And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.	0
ClaimBuster	15214	This is not my best friend.	0
ClaimBuster	15215	So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it.	0
ClaimBuster	15216	You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.	0
ClaimBuster	15217	And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	15218	When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it.	0
ClaimBuster	15219	Because it's gotten a little ugly out there.	0
ClaimBuster	15220	But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.	1
ClaimBuster	15221	Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	15222	That's why we're bringing Al Qaida to justice.	0
ClaimBuster	15223	Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.	0
ClaimBuster	15224	No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that.	0
ClaimBuster	15225	Is it in our nation's interests?	0
ClaimBuster	15226	It's going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it's going to create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	15227	But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.	0
ClaimBuster	15228	Will we have equal opportunity?	0
ClaimBuster	15229	I have roundly condemned those acts.	1
ClaimBuster	15230	Every plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those.	1
ClaimBuster	15231	The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked.	0
ClaimBuster	15232	And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much.	0
ClaimBuster	15233	Until about five months ago the Japanese economy was in a deep recession.	1
ClaimBuster	15234	I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	15235	Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.	0
ClaimBuster	15236	This economy is starting to run downhill.	0
ClaimBuster	15237	If you're a family of four making $50,000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	15238	It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.	0
ClaimBuster	15239	Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened.	1
ClaimBuster	15240	There's no ceasefire in Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	15241	And that's the way it's always been, and that's the way it always will be.	0
ClaimBuster	15242	One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	15243	But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.	1
ClaimBuster	15244	wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?	0
ClaimBuster	15245	And it was a smart move because there's gas reserves up there.	1
ClaimBuster	15246	The problem we have today is like the patient's bill of rights, particularly with health care, there's a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	15247	... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.	0
ClaimBuster	15248	And I want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	15249	And I simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded.	1
ClaimBuster	15250	Our education system can be improved.	0
ClaimBuster	15251	"They don't like the use of the word, but may I remind his strong supporters that only last year in the primary, to capture that Democratic nomination, he said, ""I am a progressive liberal Democrat."""	1
ClaimBuster	15252	It may be because of our experiences.	0
ClaimBuster	15253	I do think there are special experiences and judgments and backgrounds and understandings that women bring to this process, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	15254	Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.	0
ClaimBuster	15255	And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	15256	Now, that ought to get everybody back up to let's get along together and make it work.	0
ClaimBuster	15257	That's one of the things I want to change.	0
ClaimBuster	15258	You know, under my leadership, what we've done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states.	1
ClaimBuster	15259	Of course, we're paying attention to these.	0
ClaimBuster	15260	What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.	0
ClaimBuster	15261	Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	15262	This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.	0
ClaimBuster	15263	And it's estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	15264	And our team of -- our country's team over there did a great job.	0
ClaimBuster	15265	The secretary of state has made better than fifty speeches all over the United States explaining American foreign policy.	1
ClaimBuster	15266	Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	15267	Let me give you some advice.	0
ClaimBuster	15268	First I want to compliment the governor on his response to those fires and floods in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	15269	Well, I've never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then.	1
ClaimBuster	15270	That is not who America is.	0
ClaimBuster	15271	A lot of people are busy and it's hard for them to just get there and vote.	0
ClaimBuster	15272	There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.	0
ClaimBuster	15273	I see the valley below, and it's a valley of peace.	0
ClaimBuster	15274	You know how I know?	0
ClaimBuster	15275	I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.	0
ClaimBuster	15276	Drugs are pouring in through the border.	1
ClaimBuster	15277	And then the war was very badly mishandled.	0
ClaimBuster	15278	And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	15279	Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.	0
ClaimBuster	15280	One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace.	1
ClaimBuster	15281	In the last uh - two weeks, I've had a chance to talk to uh - two men who have visited uh - the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China.	1
ClaimBuster	15282	I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.	1
ClaimBuster	15283	We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	15284	What I worry about with the president is that he's not acknowledging what's on the ground, he's not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he's not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem-cell research or of global warming and other issues.	1
ClaimBuster	15285	I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	15286	We need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenges of a post cold war era, a smaller permanent military force, but one that is more mobile, well trained with high technology equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	15287	And they got the ultimate punishment.	1
ClaimBuster	15288	And one final comment, uh - Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law.	1
ClaimBuster	15289	So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.	0
ClaimBuster	15290	It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years.	0
ClaimBuster	15291	I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.	0
ClaimBuster	15292	Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	15293	Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	15294	China may have it by 1963, Egypt.	0
ClaimBuster	15295	Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.	0
ClaimBuster	15296	And there's a lot of good people working hard.	0
ClaimBuster	15297	But I also believe something else about that.	0
ClaimBuster	15298	It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.	1
ClaimBuster	15299	My attitude is you ain't seen nothing yet.	0
ClaimBuster	15300	Now what do the Chinese Communists want?	0
ClaimBuster	15301	Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries.	0
ClaimBuster	15302	And then, after it worked, I was told that lowering taxes would increase inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	15303	Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	15304	Your your Social Security is going to be there when you retire.	0
ClaimBuster	15305	That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again.	0
ClaimBuster	15306	I know how the do that, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	15307	I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore.	1
ClaimBuster	15308	If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.	0
ClaimBuster	15309	I was up in New Hampshire the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	15310	And if you pass the big drug companies' bill, nothing will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	15311	Our nation needs to be credible and strong.	0
ClaimBuster	15312	I applaud them for it, I don't criticize them.	0
ClaimBuster	15313	And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	15314	I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces.	1
ClaimBuster	15315	We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should.	1
ClaimBuster	15316	America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible.	0
ClaimBuster	15317	Why that's more than the average teacher makes.	1
ClaimBuster	15318	He's a dear and beloved friend to all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	15319	Is this a war-torn country?	0
ClaimBuster	15320	The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15321	They know that she's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America.	0
ClaimBuster	15322	I want competition and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way and have -- oh, here's the other point.	0
ClaimBuster	15323	I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	15324	I have a simple philosophy that I tried to follow for the last four years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody's got a role to play and a place at the table.	0
ClaimBuster	15325	Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there.	0
ClaimBuster	15326	And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else.	0
ClaimBuster	15327	But the point is, that - that a president ought to lead this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15328	If the question -- maybe I -- get it wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	15329	I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country.	1
ClaimBuster	15330	You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.	1
ClaimBuster	15331	It's 10 cents a year cumulative.	1
ClaimBuster	15332	It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	15333	Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked.	1
ClaimBuster	15334	If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine.	0
ClaimBuster	15335	We've got to invest and grow.	0
ClaimBuster	15336	The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landowners -- things of that kind.	1
ClaimBuster	15337	Depends on what he says in the future in the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	15338	These are all the things, I think, in this country that can make our society strong, or can mean that it stands still.	0
ClaimBuster	15339	Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.	0
ClaimBuster	15340	Well, there are summits being held.	1
ClaimBuster	15341	Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.	1
ClaimBuster	15342	But I think it's a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission.	0
ClaimBuster	15343	But more importantly it is true that in order for us to be competitive, we're going to have to make some smart choices right now.	0
ClaimBuster	15344	But I don't favor a constitutional amendment on the subject.	0
ClaimBuster	15345	Than they are on research and development.	0
ClaimBuster	15346	Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	15347	Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?	0
ClaimBuster	15348	"But I must say I'm a little offended by this word ""scheme."""	0
ClaimBuster	15349	And he could do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	15350	We've got to change it.	0
ClaimBuster	15351	There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counterweapon.	1
ClaimBuster	15352	It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	15353	Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	15354	Senator Kennedy's position and mine completely different on this.	0
ClaimBuster	15355	They've intermarried with Al Qaida and the Taliban.	1
ClaimBuster	15356	Why can't we have that once again?	0
ClaimBuster	15357	I know the President's been puffing a lot on that.	0
ClaimBuster	15358	Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take them out of the picture.	0
ClaimBuster	15359	ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	15360	Meanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions.	1
ClaimBuster	15361	General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	15362	We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	15363	We can put the Communists on the defensive.	0
ClaimBuster	15364	They did after he left.	1
ClaimBuster	15365	They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program.	1
ClaimBuster	15366	Reduce the capital gains rate.	0
ClaimBuster	15367	As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	15368	And it would be a federal law preventing that.	0
ClaimBuster	15369	Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	15370	That's not going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	15371	We've lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	15372	I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley saying he authored the EITC when it didn't happen.	1
ClaimBuster	15373	You know we've suffered discrimination in the disability community.	0
ClaimBuster	15374	There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers' money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns.	1
ClaimBuster	15375	Well, I'll tell you what it means.	0
ClaimBuster	15376	They start from a much lower base.	0
ClaimBuster	15377	I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th.	1
ClaimBuster	15378	I have a plan for doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	15379	I feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	15380	The Vice President believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	15381	Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.	1
ClaimBuster	15382	The plans are all over Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	15383	Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	15384	That's not right in America.	0
ClaimBuster	15385	That turned out to be wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	15386	We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	15387	If this were a spending contest, I would come in second.	0
ClaimBuster	15388	The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.	0
ClaimBuster	15389	And we're doing just that.	0
ClaimBuster	15390	The safest of federal investments yields 4%.	1
ClaimBuster	15391	I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.	0
ClaimBuster	15392	But I'm totally opposed to discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	15393	If we turn to Helsinki - I'm glad you raised it, Mr. uh - Frankel.	0
ClaimBuster	15394	And we fixed it for a reason: because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism, and so we have a distance to travel.	0
ClaimBuster	15395	For 3 months -- quarters I've been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business.	1
ClaimBuster	15396	And the answer they came up with was this:	0
ClaimBuster	15397	And we've had many successful Muslims.	1
ClaimBuster	15398	And Texas is number one in industrial pollution.	1
ClaimBuster	15399	Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself.	1
ClaimBuster	15400	And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.	0
ClaimBuster	15401	I'll tell you where we disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	15402	Now we have a runaway arms race.	0
ClaimBuster	15403	But that's how we're going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	15404	It was higher when I came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	15405	And then we're going to have to get to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	15406	Now, but here is why it's directly relevant, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	15407	Premiums have gotten too high.	1
ClaimBuster	15408	We didn't have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.	1
ClaimBuster	15409	I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.	0
ClaimBuster	15410	I have made myself at least ten uh - speeches in various parts of the country where I have discussed with the American people defense and foreign policy.	1
ClaimBuster	15411	Will they raise incomes in America?	0
ClaimBuster	15412	Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin.	0
ClaimBuster	15413	And her son had been shot through the head.	1
ClaimBuster	15414	We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	15415	My passion is to pass a jobs program and get incomes up with an investment incentive program to grow jobs in the private sector, to waste less public money and invest more, to control health care costs and provide for affordable health care for all Americans and to make sure we've got the best trained workforce in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	15416	Let me just finish the point.	0
ClaimBuster	15417	And you know, you've seen the list, I've seen the list, we won't go into the names, but no wonder they -- if I had those people around me all day every day, telling me it was fair and free, I might believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	15418	Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.	0
ClaimBuster	15419	And my economic plan calls for that.	0
ClaimBuster	15420	"And DeGaulle waved them off and said, ""No, no, no, no."	1
ClaimBuster	15421	And I said, well, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	15422	And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.	0
ClaimBuster	15423	The payroll taxes are your money.	1
ClaimBuster	15424	Now, I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work.	0
ClaimBuster	15425	Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand their business.	0
ClaimBuster	15426	This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	15427	Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this.	0
ClaimBuster	15428	Well, let's step back and talk about what's happening in Syria and how important it is.	0
ClaimBuster	15429	If we're smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest.	0
ClaimBuster	15430	But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go.	0
ClaimBuster	15431	Well, he's better off than he was four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	15432	But in terms of being influenced by women and being a minority, there they are right out there, my wife and my 4 beautiful daughters, and I just have 1 son, so he and I are surrounded by women, giving -- telling us what to do all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	15433	Of course, both er - Senator Kennedy and I have felt Mr. Truman's ire; and uh - consequently, I think he can speak with some feeling on this subject.	0
ClaimBuster	15434	I thought they would stay and fight, but they didn't.	0
ClaimBuster	15435	Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents.	1
ClaimBuster	15436	And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.	0
ClaimBuster	15437	My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	15438	And our alliance is strong.	0
ClaimBuster	15439	I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.	0
ClaimBuster	15440	When I campaigned in a race, a lot of folks didn't think I could win including, by the way, my mother.	1
ClaimBuster	15441	He talked about a nuclear freeze back at the time when I was in Europe trying to convince European public opinion that we ought to go forward with the deployment of the INF weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	15442	Let me give you a story about public education, if I might.	0
ClaimBuster	15443	Then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60,000.	0
ClaimBuster	15444	And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.	0
ClaimBuster	15445	You did it in 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	15446	Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.	1
ClaimBuster	15447	I mean, we thought we'd whip more of them going in.	0
ClaimBuster	15448	Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?	0
ClaimBuster	15449	Voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench.	0
ClaimBuster	15450	Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.	0
ClaimBuster	15451	We have a divided nation.	0
ClaimBuster	15452	I've met them, people like Mary Annie and Edward Davis in Nashua, New Hampshire.	1
ClaimBuster	15453	Well, I was interested in Senator Obama's reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	15454	I've been fighting for proliferation the entire time -- anti-proliferation the entire time I've been in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	15455	By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	15456	These crooks -- now, Willie Sutton would have gone to own a savings and loan rather than rob banks, because he robbed banks because that's where the money is; owning a savings and loan is where the money was.	1
ClaimBuster	15457	He has about a third as much chance to be a professional man, about half as much chance to own a house.	1
ClaimBuster	15458	But I have common sense.	0
ClaimBuster	15459	We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country - every man, woman and child - for health care.	1
ClaimBuster	15460	You're not going to have the opportunities; there are going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	15461	That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.	0
ClaimBuster	15462	But we have no leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	15463	Ross was very articulate across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	15464	The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	15465	And I am not going to lay down my arms in the middle of the campaign for somebody who has got no credibility on the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	15466	I don't think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee.	0
ClaimBuster	15467	I'll make one more point.	0
ClaimBuster	15468	We're quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy's suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	15469	I think that's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	15470	"Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be."	0
ClaimBuster	15471	But still, it's good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	15472	I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes.	0
ClaimBuster	15473	So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair.	0
ClaimBuster	15474	I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states.	0
ClaimBuster	15475	"When Mr. Reagan raised this uh - question in Florida uh - Mr. Ford not only disavowed his instructions, but he also even dropped, parenthetically, the use of the word ""detente."""	1
ClaimBuster	15476	I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.	0
ClaimBuster	15477	We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	15478	It's just going to be talk.	0
ClaimBuster	15479	This is what I deeply believe.	0
ClaimBuster	15480	And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	15481	Let's start with a premise.	0
ClaimBuster	15482	Our economic strength is still there.	0
ClaimBuster	15483	I know that uh Chief Justice Burger is.	0
ClaimBuster	15484	We've taken no strong position in the uh - control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh - threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	15485	One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	15486	Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.	1
ClaimBuster	15487	And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	15488	I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.	0
ClaimBuster	15489	And therefore, I have been in favor of a separate minimum for them.	0
ClaimBuster	15490	Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	15491	I want to quote somebody a little closer to home, Harry Truman.	0
ClaimBuster	15492	And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.	0
ClaimBuster	15493	And I may be better off four years from now, but I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	15494	I want us to do more to help small business.	0
ClaimBuster	15495	But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency.	0
ClaimBuster	15496	And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.	1
ClaimBuster	15497	So it seems to me that there's also a public trust.	0
ClaimBuster	15498	Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.	1
ClaimBuster	15499	It is essential that America's word be good.	0
ClaimBuster	15500	But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	15501	Again, you can look it up.	0
ClaimBuster	15502	As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.	0
ClaimBuster	15503	Seventy percent of my state's money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other -- they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s.	1
ClaimBuster	15504	... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.	1
ClaimBuster	15505	They've been talking about it in Washington, D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	15506	I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.	0
ClaimBuster	15507	Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.	1
ClaimBuster	15508	If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.	0
ClaimBuster	15509	And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.	0
ClaimBuster	15510	There are some problem banks out there.	1
ClaimBuster	15511	And therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school.	0
ClaimBuster	15512	Do you know that we've laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China?	1
ClaimBuster	15513	Why didn't you do it?	0
ClaimBuster	15514	These are the policies I have fought for my entire career.	1
ClaimBuster	15515	I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.	0
ClaimBuster	15516	Yeah, I can't imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed.	0
ClaimBuster	15517	This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.	0
ClaimBuster	15518	It's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.	0
ClaimBuster	15519	Let me say first of all, I want to answer your specific question but first of all, we all agree that there should be a growing economy.	0
ClaimBuster	15520	It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.	1
ClaimBuster	15521	I think they will, and I think we'll get there.	0
ClaimBuster	15522	Ukraine, right now, is in the sights of Vladimir Putin, those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	15523	I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people.	0
ClaimBuster	15524	And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago -- I know, because I was a Democrat at that time.	1
ClaimBuster	15525	Because we've got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	15526	What I called it, I labeled it affirmative access.	1
ClaimBuster	15527	And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	15528	I don't think that'll work.	0
ClaimBuster	15529	And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives.	1
ClaimBuster	15530	And Assad -- excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we're going to try to have a ceasefire.	1
ClaimBuster	15531	I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.	0
ClaimBuster	15532	It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want.	1
ClaimBuster	15533	And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom.	0
ClaimBuster	15534	And they went out and bought up these mortgages.	1
ClaimBuster	15535	We're the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there.	1
ClaimBuster	15536	I demanded an apology from Vice President Bush because I had, instead, honored these young men, grieved for their families, and think they were wonderful Americans that honored us all.	1
ClaimBuster	15537	I admire the fact that he is a great dad.	0
ClaimBuster	15538	What was the other part of it?	0
ClaimBuster	15539	So what I've tried to do is be consistent.	0
ClaimBuster	15540	I'm here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college.	1
ClaimBuster	15541	He said he would reform it.	1
ClaimBuster	15542	You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	15543	I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.	0
ClaimBuster	15544	Over the next four years, we'll make sure the economy continues to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	15545	I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	15546	So I am one who believes that we can	0
ClaimBuster	15547	I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they're working.	0
ClaimBuster	15548	Look, I've got five boys.	1
ClaimBuster	15549	I do not want to see us go to again and Fm using this word advisedly a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the Bench.	0
ClaimBuster	15550	That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	15551	I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	15552	They have poor-quality health care.	1
ClaimBuster	15553	My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.	1
ClaimBuster	15554	We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.	0
ClaimBuster	15555	Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling.	0
ClaimBuster	15556	In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	15557	It's time for the man to go.	0
ClaimBuster	15558	We give them $1.7 billion in cash.	1
ClaimBuster	15559	I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	15560	And they include you and me.	0
ClaimBuster	15561	And we have not set an example for our own people.	0
ClaimBuster	15562	It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.	0
ClaimBuster	15563	You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right.	1
ClaimBuster	15564	We need to be thinking about cyber security.	0
ClaimBuster	15565	But I want to warn my fellow citizens: The cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is OK, far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children.	1
ClaimBuster	15566	So it's not just the addition of troops that matters.	0
ClaimBuster	15567	So we're going to have to make some investments, but we've also got to make spending cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	15568	We still have some of that hatred inside us.	0
ClaimBuster	15569	The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns.	0
ClaimBuster	15570	No, but you got to go back to what social security was when it was created.	0
ClaimBuster	15571	A judicious use of the military which will help keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	15572	But look, let me sum it up.	0
ClaimBuster	15573	We can invite all the candidates.	0
ClaimBuster	15574	That's not the main issue.	0
ClaimBuster	15575	We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15576	But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it's very uh - far in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	15577	I'll take the pledge because I know the American people want to talk about issues and not tabloid journalism.	0
ClaimBuster	15578	It is working, and we're going to continue on that same line.	1
ClaimBuster	15579	I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise.	0
ClaimBuster	15580	They continue to modernize and we can't simply we've got enough nuclear weapons, let's freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	15581	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.	1
ClaimBuster	15582	Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it.	1
ClaimBuster	15583	We resolved, we rescued Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	15584	Not if I didn't have a better idea.	0
ClaimBuster	15585	But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly.	0
ClaimBuster	15586	It didn't exceed beyond mine, because I know that that's a strategy that has worked and can succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	15587	More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force.	1
ClaimBuster	15588	Instead of the federal government, we had that tax credit, pick up some of the costs, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, that's a cost.	0
ClaimBuster	15589	I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	15590	I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college.	0
ClaimBuster	15591	And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.	1
ClaimBuster	15592	I believe in its future.	0
ClaimBuster	15593	We had an even worse oil shock in 1979.	1
ClaimBuster	15594	I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	15595	So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.	0
ClaimBuster	15596	It's the most successful thing we've ever done.	0
ClaimBuster	15597	We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	15598	I don't think a president can unilaterally overturn it.	0
ClaimBuster	15599	I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.	0
ClaimBuster	15600	They didn't have the right body armor.	1
ClaimBuster	15601	His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.	1
ClaimBuster	15602	Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	15603	I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.	1
ClaimBuster	15604	Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border.	1
ClaimBuster	15605	That is a national outrage.	0
ClaimBuster	15606	Now, uh - I'd like to point out as well that the United States' economic recovery from the recession of a year ago is well ahead of the economic recovery of any major free industrial nation in the world today.	1
ClaimBuster	15607	We -- we think of their families and care for them deeply.	0
ClaimBuster	15608	Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in '92, it's all done with campaign finance reform.	1
ClaimBuster	15609	Here's some help for you to go to a community college.	0
ClaimBuster	15610	And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	15611	So the answer is I could do that.	0
ClaimBuster	15612	Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?	0
ClaimBuster	15613	And there will be a significant transition.	0
ClaimBuster	15614	This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.	0
ClaimBuster	15615	That's why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required.	0
ClaimBuster	15616	My priority is making sure that we get more people hired.	0
ClaimBuster	15617	It can't do it all, but it can make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	15618	He didn't call for self-deportation.	1
ClaimBuster	15619	Now that's what we have to do.	0
ClaimBuster	15620	When my grandfather fought in World War II and he came back and he got a G.I.	1
ClaimBuster	15621	There's not someone there directing all of this activity.	0
ClaimBuster	15622	I think I did the right thing.	0
ClaimBuster	15623	That's part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Senator McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasn't that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly.	1
ClaimBuster	15624	So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	15625	It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	15626	And so I think we need to think differently.	0
ClaimBuster	15627	It's a question of character and judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	15628	Did it make him withdraw from the north?	0
ClaimBuster	15629	We're going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.	1
ClaimBuster	15630	Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws.	0
ClaimBuster	15631	And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.	1
ClaimBuster	15632	Well, Candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	15633	Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	15634	He's got to get this thing more clear.	0
ClaimBuster	15635	We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund.	1
ClaimBuster	15636	The top -- let's talk about my tax plan.	0
ClaimBuster	15637	A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on.	0
ClaimBuster	15638	On looking specifically at the Arkansas record -- he keeps criticizing us, criticizing me, I'm the incumbent, fine.	0
ClaimBuster	15639	We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that we're confronted with.	1
ClaimBuster	15640	By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	15641	It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	15642	"I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, ""Reading is the new civil right,"" and she's right."	1
ClaimBuster	15643	And so I acknowledge that his daughters -- I've watched them.	1
ClaimBuster	15644	I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	15645	I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.	1
ClaimBuster	15646	"Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU."""	1
ClaimBuster	15647	We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.	0
ClaimBuster	15648	The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.	1
ClaimBuster	15649	They're interested in keeping Assad in power.	1
ClaimBuster	15650	Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.	0
ClaimBuster	15651	He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.	0
ClaimBuster	15652	And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.	0
ClaimBuster	15653	Iris, this is one where we have some agreement, I think.	0
ClaimBuster	15654	If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	15655	And that's where the President has opposed practically every arms control agreement, by every President, of both political parties, since the bomb went off.	1
ClaimBuster	15656	That is the true way I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	15657	In the last four years we've worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality.	0
ClaimBuster	15658	And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.	0
ClaimBuster	15659	That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established.	1
ClaimBuster	15660	Uh - I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.	0
ClaimBuster	15661	I think we all know America is going through tough times right now.	0
ClaimBuster	15662	There are, as you know, CIA men stationed in other countries in the world and, certainly, in Central America.	1
ClaimBuster	15663	The most dangerous aspect of this proposal is, for the first time, we would delegate to computers the decision as to whether to start a war.	0
ClaimBuster	15664	If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can't do education.	1
ClaimBuster	15665	And, you know, I'm frankly amazed that since you grew up 5 blocks from there you would think that what goes on in that state is irrelevant.	1
ClaimBuster	15666	This -- we have weakened our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	15667	Number two, that strip-mining bill would've severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh - Arab oil supply.	1
ClaimBuster	15668	When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.	0
ClaimBuster	15669	Several years ago, I was given an assignment to write a letter.	1
ClaimBuster	15670	My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court.	1
ClaimBuster	15671	Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.	0
ClaimBuster	15672	A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	15673	But let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with.	0
ClaimBuster	15674	"Groucho Marx said, ""Who do you believe?"	1
ClaimBuster	15675	It's a matter of being strong.	0
ClaimBuster	15676	That I can get something positive done on behalf of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	15677	I do not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	15678	I'm more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15679	And recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue.	1
ClaimBuster	15680	And so I think this is an issue.	0
ClaimBuster	15681	At the end of the first day, that little child wants out.	0
ClaimBuster	15682	And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	15683	I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs.	1
ClaimBuster	15684	And we would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense related jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	15685	I've been proud to be president of the United States during these very troubled times.	0
ClaimBuster	15686	So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.	0
ClaimBuster	15687	And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.	0
ClaimBuster	15688	And I would think, it seems to me that there are opportunities here.	0
ClaimBuster	15689	My -- my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.	0
ClaimBuster	15690	I have relatives on Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	15691	As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.	0
ClaimBuster	15692	I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail.	1
ClaimBuster	15693	You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.	0
ClaimBuster	15694	I also need -- the next leader needs to be patient.	0
ClaimBuster	15695	Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics.	0
ClaimBuster	15696	And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record.	0
ClaimBuster	15697	I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.	0
ClaimBuster	15698	That paid their mortgage payments?	0
ClaimBuster	15699	Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bush's answer that we certainly agree on, and that's the low income heating assistance program.	0
ClaimBuster	15700	"And he said to me and to the whole hall, he said, ""You know, don't take away my hope, because my hope is what keeps me going."""	1
ClaimBuster	15701	Forty-3 -- more than that -- states have it, I believe.	1
ClaimBuster	15702	In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bush's dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution.	1
ClaimBuster	15703	So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.	0
ClaimBuster	15704	But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation.	0
ClaimBuster	15705	And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	15706	I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents.	1
ClaimBuster	15707	I believe in the sanctity of marriage.	0
ClaimBuster	15708	It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	15709	That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there'll be no time for staffing committees or advisers.	0
ClaimBuster	15710	I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies who've never been had any experience, who came to Washington without any experience, they all were very liberal, of course, or they wouldn't be in the administration.	0
ClaimBuster	15711	And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they can't hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.	0
ClaimBuster	15712	They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them.	0
ClaimBuster	15713	It is the United States Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	15714	It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.	0
ClaimBuster	15715	Middle class seniors like George McKinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years.	1
ClaimBuster	15716	They have an income of $25,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	15717	I'll call it the economy tax.	0
ClaimBuster	15718	They made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest country in the world, that those of us especially who were the sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give something to the country that had opened up its arms to our parents and given so much to them.	0
ClaimBuster	15719	And that sends a confusing signal to people.	1
ClaimBuster	15720	This is a bad tax.	0
ClaimBuster	15721	And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices.	1
ClaimBuster	15722	Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	15723	I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.	0
ClaimBuster	15724	I mean, seriously -- labels don't mean anything.	0
ClaimBuster	15725	I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will...	0
ClaimBuster	15726	But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible.	0
ClaimBuster	15727	I believe him when he says that he has a good heart.	0
ClaimBuster	15728	We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.	0
ClaimBuster	15729	Secondly, we're going to create a manufacturing jobs credit and a new jobs credit for people to be able to help hire and be more competitive here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	15730	And we almost had it done.	0
ClaimBuster	15731	We don't have any inspection.	1
ClaimBuster	15732	That's what debates are about and that's what campaigns are about.	0
ClaimBuster	15733	I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.	0
ClaimBuster	15734	She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...	0
ClaimBuster	15735	I just don't think it's fair to tax people's assets twice regardless of your status.	0
ClaimBuster	15736	This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	15737	In uh - November of 1975 I met with the leaders of the five industrial nations in France for the purpose of seeing what we could do acting together to meet the problems of uh - the coming recession.	1
ClaimBuster	15738	So when you say it has no impact, it really did.	0
ClaimBuster	15739	And here's some help for you to go get an education.	0
ClaimBuster	15740	He's lost his most recent job and we've now just lost our home.	1
ClaimBuster	15741	So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.	0
ClaimBuster	15742	They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.	1
ClaimBuster	15743	Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan again -- nobody's got a business background, I guess.	0
ClaimBuster	15744	That's exactly what Kim Jong Il wants.	0
ClaimBuster	15745	But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...	1
ClaimBuster	15746	"The terrorism czar, who has worked for every president since Ronald Reagan, said, ""Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor."""	1
ClaimBuster	15747	And thank you for your service to the country.	0
ClaimBuster	15748	We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	15749	I think they're going to see through it.	0
ClaimBuster	15750	I see no evidence that it has done it.	0
ClaimBuster	15751	If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	15752	Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it.	1
ClaimBuster	15753	He talks about a smaller government.	1
ClaimBuster	15754	I haven't changed my mind: I'm going to fully fund it.	0
ClaimBuster	15755	They're not correct and if you look at my life, until I got involved in this effort, I was one person.	1
ClaimBuster	15756	I am going to carry this election debate all across this country in the last whatever remains of the last three and a half weeks, or whatever we have and the answer is no; I am not going to have any more debates, we don't need any more debates.	0
ClaimBuster	15757	I've also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed.	1
ClaimBuster	15758	And I don't deserve that.	0
ClaimBuster	15759	I'm going to make sure --	0
ClaimBuster	15760	We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.	0
ClaimBuster	15761	I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.	1
ClaimBuster	15762	As a matter of fact, there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have.	1
ClaimBuster	15763	Secondly, I think your plan -- a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, with all due respect.	0
ClaimBuster	15764	First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described.	0
ClaimBuster	15765	I've been -- Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.	1
ClaimBuster	15766	He says he supports the President's position.	1
ClaimBuster	15767	I thought you'd forgotten I was here.	0
ClaimBuster	15768	That's what you have elections for.	0
ClaimBuster	15769	Well, I don't question his passion.	0
ClaimBuster	15770	We've got to turn this thing around.	0
ClaimBuster	15771	This is, with all due respect, Governor, that's a red herring.	0
ClaimBuster	15772	Well, Mr. Cater, of course it's a criticism that uh - is being made.	0
ClaimBuster	15773	...they would have gone through a...	0
ClaimBuster	15774	We raise the student loans.	0
ClaimBuster	15775	Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.	0
ClaimBuster	15776	These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.	0
ClaimBuster	15777	One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure.	0
ClaimBuster	15778	But Governor Clinton's philosophy is isolate them.	0
ClaimBuster	15779	We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	15780	But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies.	0
ClaimBuster	15781	And I think that's the only answer.	0
ClaimBuster	15782	First of all, I think it's important to make voting more accessible.	0
ClaimBuster	15783	I think whoever is in the White House should just make it absolutely unconscionable and inexcusable, and if anybody's in the middle of a speech at, you know, one of these conventions, I would expect the candidate to go out and lift him off the stage if he starts preaching hate -- because we don't have time for it.	0
ClaimBuster	15784	He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.	0
ClaimBuster	15785	How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and-about Angola-now, we have a chance-several Bostonians don't like it, but the rest of the country will understand.	0
ClaimBuster	15786	There were others who took a hike.	1
ClaimBuster	15787	I think it's been pretty impressive.	0
ClaimBuster	15788	Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.	0
ClaimBuster	15789	I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.	1
ClaimBuster	15790	Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand there is a connected between the two.	0
ClaimBuster	15791	That will -- that will reduce costs.	0
ClaimBuster	15792	The only thing I knew to do was to get aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help, and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them.	0
ClaimBuster	15793	When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully.	0
ClaimBuster	15794	I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications.	0
ClaimBuster	15795	You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family.	0
ClaimBuster	15796	And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.	0
ClaimBuster	15797	They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.	1
ClaimBuster	15798	We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.	1
ClaimBuster	15799	And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.	0
ClaimBuster	15800	Look, I -- I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants.	1
ClaimBuster	15801	You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	15802	Well, I think that trade is an important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	15803	Yes, I think we need more troops.	0
ClaimBuster	15804	Because I want to give new choices to parents.	0
ClaimBuster	15805	Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now.	0
ClaimBuster	15806	... at a time when it's vitally important.	0
ClaimBuster	15807	We've gone from $10 trillion of national debt, to $16 trillion of national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	15808	She has been outsmarted by Putin.	0
ClaimBuster	15809	I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	15810	But the people who will be helped the most by it are the working people who will get the jobs created because of this tax.	0
ClaimBuster	15811	Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class families, and that's what I've done, by $3,600.00.	1
ClaimBuster	15812	What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	15813	And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when -- when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	15814	And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	15815	He promised you a tax cut in 1992, and if you got one, you ought to vote for him.	1
ClaimBuster	15816	The governor's plan is Social Security minus.	0
ClaimBuster	15817	Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed.	0
ClaimBuster	15818	My plan -- you can read my plan.	0
ClaimBuster	15819	In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way.	1
ClaimBuster	15820	Of course they all want to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	15821	So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.	1
ClaimBuster	15822	So in principle, though, I'll take your point and think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is.	0
ClaimBuster	15823	Why can't Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school.	0
ClaimBuster	15824	There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	15825	And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.	0
ClaimBuster	15826	I think we all do.	0
ClaimBuster	15827	Our dollar's at an all time low against some foreign currencies.	1
ClaimBuster	15828	That's really about all we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	15829	The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	15830	It is an issue that I am willing to take on, and so I'll bring Republicans and Democrats together.	0
ClaimBuster	15831	We have differences about how to achieve them.	0
ClaimBuster	15832	I also think that we should give visas to people -- green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	15833	Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.	1
ClaimBuster	15834	An African American was my chief economic development officer.	1
ClaimBuster	15835	I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities - uh to black people - the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs.	0
ClaimBuster	15836	And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more.	1
ClaimBuster	15837	I was opposed to the war but I loved my country and we need a president who will bring this country together, not divide it.	0
ClaimBuster	15838	So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.	0
ClaimBuster	15839	There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.	0
ClaimBuster	15840	"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that."""	1
ClaimBuster	15841	That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.	0
ClaimBuster	15842	If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.	1
ClaimBuster	15843	But I finally did it.	1
ClaimBuster	15844	It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.	1
ClaimBuster	15845	That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.	0
ClaimBuster	15846	Because inside Pakistan, you have a -- a large group of Pashtun that are -- that are Taliban.	1
ClaimBuster	15847	I know the governor is against it, and I know that I'm for it.	0
ClaimBuster	15848	Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt we're giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.	1
ClaimBuster	15849	We are energy rich, and coal is one of the great potentials we have.	1
ClaimBuster	15850	If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.	0
ClaimBuster	15851	It's almost become a way of life.	0
ClaimBuster	15852	But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	15853	And doesn't that prove the point, George, which is that values like family and education and community, decent homes for young people that family on Long Island I visited on Monday where Lou and Betty Tolamo (phonetic) bought a house for some $19,000 back in 1962, have had seven children, they're all making good livings.	1
ClaimBuster	15854	And I recognize I've made some decisions that have caused people to not understand the great values of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	15855	I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.	0
ClaimBuster	15856	What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	15857	It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.	0
ClaimBuster	15858	So just to finish on the borders...	0
ClaimBuster	15859	He's been out in the state saying that, in Midwestern states.	1
ClaimBuster	15860	It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned.	0
ClaimBuster	15861	I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, we've got to change this strategy.	1
ClaimBuster	15862	I recognize there are some who just don't seem to care.	0
ClaimBuster	15863	We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries.	1
ClaimBuster	15864	And we would have lost a million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	15865	Uh - the lands that Mr. Ford uh - brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh - in size.	1
ClaimBuster	15866	That's exactly what our budget does, but it's driven by strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	15867	So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant.	0
ClaimBuster	15868	And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.	1
ClaimBuster	15869	It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.	0
ClaimBuster	15870	That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.	1
ClaimBuster	15871	There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.	0
ClaimBuster	15872	It covers the majority of the work force.	0
ClaimBuster	15873	He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.	1
ClaimBuster	15874	And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done.	1
ClaimBuster	15875	Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesn't know the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	15876	When Mr. Ford first became president in - in August of 1974, the first thing he did in - in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh - since the great depression of nineteen uh - of the 1940s.	1
ClaimBuster	15877	They're aimed at the real problem.	0
ClaimBuster	15878	But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	15879	He wants you to believe that I can't be president.	0
ClaimBuster	15880	No tax on your savings.	0
ClaimBuster	15881	Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor.	1
ClaimBuster	15882	Growth is a little over 3 percent now.	1
ClaimBuster	15883	I want high wage, high skill jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	15884	Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	15885	They don't even fight to reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	15886	I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great nation, so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	15887	Russia is a country in transition.	0
ClaimBuster	15888	And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is.	0
ClaimBuster	15889	But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now.	1
ClaimBuster	15890	And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.	1
ClaimBuster	15891	Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme.	0
ClaimBuster	15892	We must deal with threats before they fully materialize.	0
ClaimBuster	15893	Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	15894	There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.	1
ClaimBuster	15895	I think the United States can afford to do these things.	0
ClaimBuster	15896	Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.	1
ClaimBuster	15897	I'm not proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	15898	Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	15899	I was Governor of Georgia for four years.	1
ClaimBuster	15900	We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	15901	It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this.	0
ClaimBuster	15902	And so I'm against price controls.	0
ClaimBuster	15903	So in those two cases I think uh - such uh - a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don't think in either case they're trivial matters.	0
ClaimBuster	15904	And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.	1
ClaimBuster	15905	And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	15906	I do support a national patient's bill of rights.	0
ClaimBuster	15907	You're going to live in a peaceful world.	0
ClaimBuster	15908	Everybody told me they were cost-effective.	0
ClaimBuster	15909	I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	15910	Because the only type of agreements to reach with the Soviet Union are the types that are specifically defined, so we know exactly what they must do; subject to full verification, which means we know every day whether they're living up to it; and followups, wherever we find suggestions that they're violating it; and the strongest possible terms.	1
ClaimBuster	15911	It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and - and a clear assignment of responsibility and - and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government.	1
ClaimBuster	15912	America has not been standing still.	1
ClaimBuster	15913	He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?	1
ClaimBuster	15914	Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President's Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective.	1
ClaimBuster	15915	Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the president and his friends try to make a big deal out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	15916	I understand that the report today is accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	15917	We're being challenged like never before.	0
ClaimBuster	15918	We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget.	1
ClaimBuster	15919	Ann, both of them are very complicated situations.	0
ClaimBuster	15920	And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15921	You can look all around and you'll see first-class strong women.	1
ClaimBuster	15922	I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however.	1
ClaimBuster	15923	And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.	0
ClaimBuster	15924	Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down.	0
ClaimBuster	15925	That is a big project.	0
ClaimBuster	15926	I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	15927	Thanks for your questions tonight, very, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	15928	The federal government can be a part, but don't fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level.	1
ClaimBuster	15929	I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.	0
ClaimBuster	15930	And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.	0
ClaimBuster	15931	And thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision.	0
ClaimBuster	15932	We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now.	1
ClaimBuster	15933	I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.	1
ClaimBuster	15934	I have questioned his proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	15935	I'm grownup, I can deal with it, I'll pay my share.	0
ClaimBuster	15936	I know how to eliminate programs.	0
ClaimBuster	15937	Also the - the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false uh - confession.	0
ClaimBuster	15938	My opponent's right, we need good intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	15939	The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.	1
ClaimBuster	15940	I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúwe do it this way, so should you.√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù I think we can help.	0
ClaimBuster	15941	Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months.	1
ClaimBuster	15942	We must have a transition plan to plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy.	0
ClaimBuster	15943	And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	15944	And today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs.	1
ClaimBuster	15945	They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed.	1
ClaimBuster	15946	But first we must have an aggressive jobs program.	0
ClaimBuster	15947	They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation.	1
ClaimBuster	15948	First of all, Senator Dole, let's set the record straight.	0
ClaimBuster	15949	Of course, we have to come together.	0
ClaimBuster	15950	In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present.	1
ClaimBuster	15951	And that's because we've become weaker in each of those four...	0
ClaimBuster	15952	Yeah, I plead guilty to that.	0
ClaimBuster	15953	I don't think they should be allowed to.	0
ClaimBuster	15954	And then you need a philosophical -- I'd call it a philosophical underpinning.	0
ClaimBuster	15955	Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he...	0
ClaimBuster	15956	And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government.	1
ClaimBuster	15957	And she's out campaigning along with our girls.	1
ClaimBuster	15958	There are sanctions in place on Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	15959	This is a company, this isn't basic research.	0
ClaimBuster	15960	You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk.	0
ClaimBuster	15961	Provided support for some of these people, supported the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	15962	But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.	0
ClaimBuster	15963	Number three, we've got to deal with Pakistan, because Al Qaida and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, we've been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.	1
ClaimBuster	15964	I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	15965	Well, obviously, my orientation is let's go do it.	0
ClaimBuster	15966	"To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, ""If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother applying for any construction."""	1
ClaimBuster	15967	And you know what else I prepared for?	0
ClaimBuster	15968	And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession.	1
ClaimBuster	15969	But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has.	0
ClaimBuster	15970	I'm trying to put a leash on them.	0
ClaimBuster	15971	This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.	0
ClaimBuster	15972	Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	15973	But it's not going to be easy.	0
ClaimBuster	15974	The Oregon plan is a good start if the federal government is going to continue to abandon its responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	15975	There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga.	1
ClaimBuster	15976	My mother basically raised our family.	1
ClaimBuster	15977	Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.	1
ClaimBuster	15978	Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to -- to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	15979	One-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there.	0
ClaimBuster	15980	I think it's intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	15981	I agree with my opponent that we shouldn't be committing troops.	0
ClaimBuster	15982	So I would take my responsibility seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	15983	And I think that's an important transition.	0
ClaimBuster	15984	So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.	0
ClaimBuster	15985	"The No Child Left Behind Act says, ""We'll raise standards."	1
ClaimBuster	15986	That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.	0
ClaimBuster	15987	Is America better off than it was 4 years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	15988	This is an enormous boon for them.	0
ClaimBuster	15989	Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.	1
ClaimBuster	15990	I've been in Washington, D.C., three and a half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	15991	Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because we're free.	0
ClaimBuster	15992	And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and it's attributable to the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	15993	Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	15994	There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process.	1
ClaimBuster	15995	He's outsmarted her every step of the way.	0
ClaimBuster	15996	Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.	0
ClaimBuster	15997	As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh - go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	15998	They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.	1
ClaimBuster	15999	Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000.	0
ClaimBuster	16000	Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	16001	We need to be stronger on terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	16002	It is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	16003	Well, why didn't she change it?	0
ClaimBuster	16004	If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion -- just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that's more than our entire defense budget -- and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you.	1
ClaimBuster	16005	But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people - what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	16006	I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.	0
ClaimBuster	16007	I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his.	0
ClaimBuster	16008	Well as you take the bills -	0
ClaimBuster	16009	But it's gotten too much.	0
ClaimBuster	16010	I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.	0
ClaimBuster	16011	That's why I fight for equality and justice.	0
ClaimBuster	16012	We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	16013	We tend to be reactive.	0
ClaimBuster	16014	And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel's national security.	0
ClaimBuster	16015	When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility.	1
ClaimBuster	16016	"And his answer was, ""With a viable exit strategy and only with enough forces to get the job done."""	1
ClaimBuster	16017	I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.	0
ClaimBuster	16018	Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.	1
ClaimBuster	16019	The United States is leading the free world out of the recession that was serious a year, year and a half ago.	1
ClaimBuster	16020	There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.	1
ClaimBuster	16021	I think the American people want it now.	0
ClaimBuster	16022	All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, I'd love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that.	0
ClaimBuster	16023	All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.	1
ClaimBuster	16024	Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	16025	Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next four years.	1
ClaimBuster	16026	We could speed it up.	0
ClaimBuster	16027	What tools do we need to fight us?	0
ClaimBuster	16028	The US should try to work with its allies and stop it.	0
ClaimBuster	16029	In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	16030	Hillary wants to give amnesty.	1
ClaimBuster	16031	and that's where you begin.	0
ClaimBuster	16032	And all of you in the press know exactly what I'm talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	16033	I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip.	1
ClaimBuster	16034	I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy.	1
ClaimBuster	16035	I'm very proud of him.	0
ClaimBuster	16036	Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.	0
ClaimBuster	16037	This is -- this is a mindset.	0
ClaimBuster	16038	It's a very effective way of communication.	0
ClaimBuster	16039	And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path.	0
ClaimBuster	16040	Well, he was wrong then and he's wrong now.	0
ClaimBuster	16041	Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	16042	And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.	0
ClaimBuster	16043	But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	16044	Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.	1
ClaimBuster	16045	It is because we are in the grip of a failed economic theory.	0
ClaimBuster	16046	But I think that the important point is we've got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	16047	Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.	0
ClaimBuster	16048	He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.	1
ClaimBuster	16049	I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee.	1
ClaimBuster	16050	But, Andrea, I think we can go far beyond this as well, because we have opportunities now step-by-step to bring down the level of strategic weapons, get a test ban treaty, negotiate those conventional force reductions.	0
ClaimBuster	16051	And I'm for enforcing laws on the books.	0
ClaimBuster	16052	It's going to destabilize the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	16053	We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	16054	And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	16055	And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.	1
ClaimBuster	16056	And what's interesting is, it's a threat that has grown while the president has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasn't a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	16057	Not at all Because these are determined men.	0
ClaimBuster	16058	And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo.	1
ClaimBuster	16059	You see our five kids, all over this country, and their spouses.	0
ClaimBuster	16060	And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.	1
ClaimBuster	16061	But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	16062	And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.	0
ClaimBuster	16063	It has some good provisions in it.	0
ClaimBuster	16064	I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	16065	His own secretary of commerce had to be subpoenaed by the Congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	16066	Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	16067	I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television.	1
ClaimBuster	16068	And if we'd used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	16069	We have got to deal with long-term care.	0
ClaimBuster	16070	Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy.	1
ClaimBuster	16071	I promise it's less than 10 seconds.	0
ClaimBuster	16072	I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	16073	But let's look at the overall record.	0
ClaimBuster	16074	Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	16075	We in this country can -- can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we're going to.	0
ClaimBuster	16076	I think it's in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	16077	May I ask you a question?	0
ClaimBuster	16078	So I'd rather talk about my strengths.	0
ClaimBuster	16079	Governor Carter's answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago.	1
ClaimBuster	16080	And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president.	0
ClaimBuster	16081	And thank God, the freeze people were not heard.	0
ClaimBuster	16082	Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	16083	I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again.	0
ClaimBuster	16084	And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.	0
ClaimBuster	16085	And I'll tell you one place that's working well, and that is the private sector -- Jim Burke and this task force that he has, you may know about it.	0
ClaimBuster	16086	Now, they claim they're not.	1
ClaimBuster	16087	I don't think we can be all things to all people in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	16088	The warning signs are clear.	0
ClaimBuster	16089	And he just called for new elections.	1
ClaimBuster	16090	Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really.	0
ClaimBuster	16091	As a matter of fact, Iran is gonna get eighty F-14s before we even meet our own Air Force orders for F-l4s.	1
ClaimBuster	16092	We must rebuild America's strength at home.	0
ClaimBuster	16093	We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down.	0
ClaimBuster	16094	If there's a fairer way, I'm all ears (laughter) --aah.	0
ClaimBuster	16095	The warhead principle -- there have been counting rules for years.	0
ClaimBuster	16096	I can't give you a specific answer on Pension Guarantee Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	16097	We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.	0
ClaimBuster	16098	all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.	0
ClaimBuster	16099	But we've got to do even better.	0
ClaimBuster	16100	In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions.	1
ClaimBuster	16101	And there is ,so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government.	0
ClaimBuster	16102	I wouldn't be called a conservative if I were.	0
ClaimBuster	16103	Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.	1
ClaimBuster	16104	We're all God's children, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	16105	And this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	16106	No, I don't, and I'm not going to go to calling names on his facts.	0
ClaimBuster	16107	We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary.	1
ClaimBuster	16108	The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	16109	And that's why we've got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates.	1
ClaimBuster	16110	Let's look at the vote on Hungary.	0
ClaimBuster	16111	And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.	0
ClaimBuster	16112	I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	16113	A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November.	1
ClaimBuster	16114	And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983.	1
ClaimBuster	16115	It also means it takes pressure off the border.	0
ClaimBuster	16116	There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.	0
ClaimBuster	16117	In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.	1
ClaimBuster	16118	In the second century of our nation's history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe.	0
ClaimBuster	16119	My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties.	1
ClaimBuster	16120	Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.	0
ClaimBuster	16121	I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school.	0
ClaimBuster	16122	You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.	0
ClaimBuster	16123	We're talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while.	0
ClaimBuster	16124	And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years.	1
ClaimBuster	16125	My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do.	1
ClaimBuster	16126	Now, see, we practice 19th century capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	16127	The American people are healed, are working together.	0
ClaimBuster	16128	I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I'm going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families.	1
ClaimBuster	16129	Now, if you're a Red Sox fan, that's OK.	0
ClaimBuster	16130	I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	16131	Somehow we've lost that accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	16132	We do it by getting -- by reducing spending in a whole series of programs.	0
ClaimBuster	16133	That's why it's important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic.	0
ClaimBuster	16134	And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering.	0
ClaimBuster	16135	They appointed a commission I was on that commission.	1
ClaimBuster	16136	And we know what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	16137	First question is what's in the best interests of the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	16138	I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can't jerk you around and if you don't have health insurance, that you'd have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have.	1
ClaimBuster	16139	Well, Mr. uh - Nelson, uh - I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked.	1
ClaimBuster	16140	... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.	1
ClaimBuster	16141	You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana.	1
ClaimBuster	16142	Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference - and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight - that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program.	0
ClaimBuster	16143	Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.	1
ClaimBuster	16144	And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.	1
ClaimBuster	16145	I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	16146	I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	16147	But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	16148	Uh - just a moment ago, for example, uh - he uh - was indicating that uh - uh - in the 1950s, for example, uh - unemployment was very low.	0
ClaimBuster	16149	That says something about character.	0
ClaimBuster	16150	But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers.	1
ClaimBuster	16151	And in 2006, our seniors will get prescription drug coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	16152	Would I understand it if it occurred to me, and I might just say I'm from a large family.	1
ClaimBuster	16153	I have been in the Congress for fourteen years.	1
ClaimBuster	16154	But I'd also like to point out that I haven't been part of what we're criticizing in Washington tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	16155	I'm going to make sure you get a job.	0
ClaimBuster	16156	There has to be revenue in addition to cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	16157	It's an issue I know a lot about.	0
ClaimBuster	16158	I would say I didn't hear what Yassir Arafat had to say, but I don't want to -- you know, I think foreign policy, I want to be very careful about, and I'm not here to argue about the President with some ongoing foreign policy matter.	0
ClaimBuster	16159	These interest rates we have now don't make any sense.	0
ClaimBuster	16160	But as far as special rights, I'm opposed to same-sex marriages, which the President signed well after midnight one morning in the dark of night.	1
ClaimBuster	16161	What I have said is that the president ought to have a chance to appoint a chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminous uh term; in other words, both of 'em serve the same four - four years.	1
ClaimBuster	16162	I want to make sure the seniors have the promise made will be a promise kept, but I want younger workers to be able to manage some of their own money, some of their own payroll taxes in the private sector under certain guidelines to get a better rate of return on your own money.	0
ClaimBuster	16163	And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3.	0
ClaimBuster	16164	Family medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job.	1
ClaimBuster	16165	I trust people, I don't trust the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	16166	Now, I think that's going back to where we started.	0
ClaimBuster	16167	And, unfortunately, he didn't go to war as a last resort.	1
ClaimBuster	16168	I don't think there's any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity and how much management has done.	0
ClaimBuster	16169	But we're going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	16170	We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives.	0
ClaimBuster	16171	Our laws against murder are State laws.	1
ClaimBuster	16172	$500 per child under 18.	1
ClaimBuster	16173	"And in the middle of the discussion, to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, ""Here, let me show you the photos."""	1
ClaimBuster	16174	Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done.	1
ClaimBuster	16175	I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	16176	And this is what we're trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem.	0
ClaimBuster	16177	But I have uh - an adequate background, I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	16178	I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	16179	But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	16180	That raises, he says $800 billion; we say $600 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	16181	And it's up in some cases because both parents are working.	1
ClaimBuster	16182	For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	16183	They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels.	1
ClaimBuster	16184	Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	16185	And I've had to fight a lot of people that were saying human rights, and we√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢re the ones that put the sanctions on and stood for it.	1
ClaimBuster	16186	Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora.	1
ClaimBuster	16187	Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they've started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.	1
ClaimBuster	16188	And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	16189	It's just not credible to say he's going to keep taxes down and balance budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	16190	Iran is taking over Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	16191	He said he's for -- you're now for capping punitive damages?	0
ClaimBuster	16192	My objection here is not the cost in dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	16193	But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.	0
ClaimBuster	16194	And so I made the decision we wouldn't spend any more money beyond the 70 lines, 22 of which are now in action, because science is important, but so is ethics, so is balancing life.	1
ClaimBuster	16195	When I came back from that war I saw that it was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	16196	When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	16197	We can only be strong overseas if we're strong at home; and when I became president we'll not only be strong in those areas but also in defense - a defense capability second to none.	0
ClaimBuster	16198	I didn't always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	16199	Making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we're creating jobs here, as we've done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	16200	His has been in the legislative branch.	1
ClaimBuster	16201	They don't want to raise the minimum wage.	0
ClaimBuster	16202	It was festooned with Christmas tree ornaments.	1
ClaimBuster	16203	Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country.	0
ClaimBuster	16204	I don't see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American president if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	16205	I appreciate your listening tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	16206	They didn't tell you that that same year they increased spending $1.83 for every dollar we increased taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	16207	I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing.	0
ClaimBuster	16208	And I also have to disagree on Senator McCain's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.	0
ClaimBuster	16209	Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country.	1
ClaimBuster	16210	They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards.	0
ClaimBuster	16211	What we need to do is empower people.	0
ClaimBuster	16212	And why hasn't she made the agreements better?	0
ClaimBuster	16213	But in the final analysis-in the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth, they're going to say, √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∞√Ç¬•Who has the values I believe in?	0
ClaimBuster	16214	I do believe that there's some fairly good news out there.	0
ClaimBuster	16215	That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people - people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible.	0
ClaimBuster	16216	You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	16217	And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	0
ClaimBuster	16218	I'm convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed.	0
ClaimBuster	16219	She's raising your taxes really high.	0
ClaimBuster	16220	I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.	0
ClaimBuster	16221	But I would have used that force wisely, I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	16222	Thank you Barbara (barely audible).	0
ClaimBuster	16223	My argument with him on -- the question was about the draft -- is that there's this same pattern.	0
ClaimBuster	16224	I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.	0
ClaimBuster	16225	I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it.	0
ClaimBuster	16226	Well, I'll tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	16227	This election is about two different visions about how we should go into the 21st Century.	0
ClaimBuster	16228	The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring.	0
ClaimBuster	16229	And at his pace, it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	16230	They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	16231	...you've had the floor for a while.	1
ClaimBuster	16232	What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.	0
ClaimBuster	16233	The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	16234	In fact he is on Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	16235	But not by raising taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	16236	Many of the countries below that used to say, well, this is the US' problem -- if you'd get the demand down, then we wouldn't have the problem -- are working cooperatively with the DEA and the military.	1
ClaimBuster	16237	Well, my blood pressure is lower, my weight, my cholesterol, but I will not make health an issue in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	16238	And in the '60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried.	1
ClaimBuster	16239	We ought to be working with the African Union to do so -- precisely what we did in Liberia.	0
ClaimBuster	16240	And so we began a new dialogue with North Korea, one that included not only the United States, but now China.	1
ClaimBuster	16241	The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.	1
ClaimBuster	16242	All they've got to show for 4 years in U.S.-Soviet relations is one meeting in the last weeks of an administration, and nothing before.	1
ClaimBuster	16243	I don't take it personally.	0
ClaimBuster	16244	What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	16245	Is the United States standing still?	0
ClaimBuster	16246	And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.	0
ClaimBuster	16247	I have worked in my state to reduce teen pregnancy and illness among children.	1
ClaimBuster	16248	I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries.	0
ClaimBuster	16249	We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.	0
ClaimBuster	16250	First of all, I would quit conducting the decision-making process in secret, as has been a characteristic of Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Ford.	0
ClaimBuster	16251	First of all, let me say what we have done.	0
ClaimBuster	16252	It means that there will be a reduction in the uhh - unemployment.	0
ClaimBuster	16253	The reason I have opposed that initiative is because I'm afraid it will end those extra effort programs.	0
ClaimBuster	16254	Well, first of all, I think it's important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if it's structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure it's structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and that's important to understand.	1
ClaimBuster	16255	They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway.	1
ClaimBuster	16256	I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	16257	Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions.	0
ClaimBuster	16258	I met Grant Milliron, Mansfield, Ohio.	1
ClaimBuster	16259	Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support.	1
ClaimBuster	16260	I think it's important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	16261	I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.	0
ClaimBuster	16262	This is something that we can do; the Congress failed to do it, and we intend to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	16263	But if you look at public education alone and you take into account the fact that we have more racial diversity and more poverty, it makes a big difference.	1
ClaimBuster	16264	We can't I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyone's taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.	0
ClaimBuster	16265	And I think the housing community is ready.	0
ClaimBuster	16266	In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.	1
ClaimBuster	16267	They don't want you to help them anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	16268	But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	16269	It was a beautiful moment and I think she'll do a first-class job on that commission.	0
ClaimBuster	16270	Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	16271	I can't promise that I will never get another detail wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	16272	Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.	0
ClaimBuster	16273	The -- here are the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	16274	... the small businesses we're talking about...	0
ClaimBuster	16275	There is a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	16276	It needs to be competent.	0
ClaimBuster	16277	We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the -- the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is -- it's certainly not on the run.	0
ClaimBuster	16278	We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.	1
ClaimBuster	16279	First of all √É‚Äö I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	16280	Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?	0
ClaimBuster	16281	Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.	0
ClaimBuster	16282	Our government is that point now.	0
ClaimBuster	16283	You know, children listen to what is being said.	0
ClaimBuster	16284	It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate.	0
ClaimBuster	16285	I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.	1
ClaimBuster	16286	We sign a peace treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	16287	And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.	1
ClaimBuster	16288	And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.	1
ClaimBuster	16289	Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.	0
ClaimBuster	16290	And it would also be very disturbing to our allies, all of whom support this nuclear arms treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	16291	There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and we're going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014.	1
ClaimBuster	16292	If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing.	0
ClaimBuster	16293	Apparently you can't pass any test under his vision of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	16294	This is a big issue.	0
ClaimBuster	16295	I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.	1
ClaimBuster	16296	I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in.	0
ClaimBuster	16297	Our military is assisting in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	16298	And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	16299	This keeps up with technology.	0
ClaimBuster	16300	So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.	0
ClaimBuster	16301	So in other words, it's pretty divided during the 1990s as well.	1
ClaimBuster	16302	I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is -- which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	16303	We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	16304	Let's take your warhead principle.	0
ClaimBuster	16305	That's why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there.	1
ClaimBuster	16306	I looked at the slowest growth in the century.	1
ClaimBuster	16307	I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company.	1
ClaimBuster	16308	Russia is new in terms of nuclear.	0
ClaimBuster	16309	On April 17 he said he'd bring out all the records on the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	16310	And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	16311	Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	16312	Did we inflict any damage?	0
ClaimBuster	16313	But I disagree with them, as do many.	0
ClaimBuster	16314	But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.	0
ClaimBuster	16315	And I was glad to hear him say that, because that's what we've been doing ever since I announced to the British Parliament that I thought we should do this.	1
ClaimBuster	16316	We've got an aggressive brown field program to refurbish inner-city sore spots to useful pieces of property.	1
ClaimBuster	16317	It's from $4000 to about $2000.	1
ClaimBuster	16318	This is a big spender.	1
ClaimBuster	16319	And the government doesn't create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	16320	Now, Jim, let me get it out.	0
ClaimBuster	16321	It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides.	0
ClaimBuster	16322	That's what the economists tell us.	1
ClaimBuster	16323	Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.	1
ClaimBuster	16324	It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.	0
ClaimBuster	16325	But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh - add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector - not make jobs, where the jobs really are.	1
ClaimBuster	16326	But I'm somebody who believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first before you start new stuff.	0
ClaimBuster	16327	We've done it in Arkansas.	1
ClaimBuster	16328	And I think we have a powerful country.	0
ClaimBuster	16329	And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.	0
ClaimBuster	16330	As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn't put my name on the list.	1
ClaimBuster	16331	Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.	0
ClaimBuster	16332	But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.	1
ClaimBuster	16333	I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	16334	Bob, I just need to comment on this.	0
ClaimBuster	16335	I know what it takes to get this economy going.	0
ClaimBuster	16336	The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.	0
ClaimBuster	16337	And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	16338	I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.	0
ClaimBuster	16339	Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Senator Obama's tax policies.	0
ClaimBuster	16340	I'm going to help the African-Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	16341	But where we're not making it is with the confirmed addicts.	0
ClaimBuster	16342	Now, what I've done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut.	1
ClaimBuster	16343	And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.	0
ClaimBuster	16344	But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	16345	In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	16346	What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States?	0
ClaimBuster	16347	And I can go on and on.	0
ClaimBuster	16348	I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live.	1
ClaimBuster	16349	So he's replaced by Mary Fisher who electrified the Republican Convention by talking about the compassion and the concern that we feel.	0
ClaimBuster	16350	Well, let me just make a couple of points.	0
ClaimBuster	16351	put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.	0
ClaimBuster	16352	They've got a lot of concerns.	0
ClaimBuster	16353	But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.	0
ClaimBuster	16354	Nor has he indicated that he will support Title Three, which would give the Attorney General additional powers to protect Constitutional rights.	1
ClaimBuster	16355	In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	16356	Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.	0
ClaimBuster	16357	Well, I think we're getting better all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	16358	And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.	0
ClaimBuster	16359	Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?	0
ClaimBuster	16360	When I came into office, the world was divided.	0
ClaimBuster	16361	He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	16362	He hasn't done that either.	1
ClaimBuster	16363	Let me give you a prime example.	0
ClaimBuster	16364	And, therefore, I don't feel -- and my minister knows this and supports me in this position -- I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example.	0
ClaimBuster	16365	We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground.	0
ClaimBuster	16366	And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	16367	It was a moment ago and I didn't get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	16368	I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults.	0
ClaimBuster	16369	This was last August, a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	16370	Look, if Ross were right when we get a free trade agreement with Mexico, why wouldn't they have gone down there now?	0
ClaimBuster	16371	And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.	1
ClaimBuster	16372	So you can't blame the practitioners for the health problem.	0
ClaimBuster	16373	But you can't just do it by cutting Medicare; you have to take on the insurance companies, the bureaucracies.	0
ClaimBuster	16374	I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished.	0
ClaimBuster	16375	Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I don't understand.	1
ClaimBuster	16376	And we have a Fed that's doing political things.	0
ClaimBuster	16377	I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	16378	Think about it: They're going from tyranny to elections.	0
ClaimBuster	16379	And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.	1
ClaimBuster	16380	And Senator Obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.	0
ClaimBuster	16381	We've allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	16382	"And suddenly somebody says, ""Oh, it's got to be up there, and it's Star Wars,'' and so forth."	1
ClaimBuster	16383	The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states.	1
ClaimBuster	16384	And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter.	1
ClaimBuster	16385	I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.	1
ClaimBuster	16386	I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.	0
ClaimBuster	16387	Well, let me tell you straight up: I've never changed my mind about Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	16388	I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	16389	I'll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that's important to this country.	0
ClaimBuster	16390	We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.	1
ClaimBuster	16391	But she works for me.	1
ClaimBuster	16392	See, divided teams lose; united teams win.	0
ClaimBuster	16393	Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.	1
ClaimBuster	16394	The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.	0
ClaimBuster	16395	"Join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time?"""	0
ClaimBuster	16396	I saw them work, I saw them make very hard decisions.	1
ClaimBuster	16397	Let's -- let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in.	0
ClaimBuster	16398	I want to develop the coal resources in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16399	We need to put one person in charge of the battle against AIDS to cut across all the agencies that deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	16400	And that's what we need, I think, in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	16401	And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.	1
ClaimBuster	16402	But what I've also said is let's hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed.	1
ClaimBuster	16403	I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.	1
ClaimBuster	16404	But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.	0
ClaimBuster	16405	Number one, if I get there, it will be a very unusual and historical event --	0
ClaimBuster	16406	We provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	16407	Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	16408	She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.	0
ClaimBuster	16409	The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	16410	You didn't hear what I said.	0
ClaimBuster	16411	All over the world, people are being torn apart -- Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi -- you name it -- because of all their differences.	0
ClaimBuster	16412	The last point is that the major - uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	16413	Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.	0
ClaimBuster	16414	so I think we will wait, see what they present, take a look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	16415	But when you were a candidate in 2008, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man.	1
ClaimBuster	16416	The goal is for every single child to learn to Read.	0
ClaimBuster	16417	-- this was a spontaneous --	0
ClaimBuster	16418	Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your question that I didn't know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts.	1
ClaimBuster	16419	Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year.	1
ClaimBuster	16420	I think it's a disgrace.	0
ClaimBuster	16421	There are we certainly ought to be able to	0
ClaimBuster	16422	Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns.	1
ClaimBuster	16423	The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.	1
ClaimBuster	16424	I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting.	0
ClaimBuster	16425	We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.	1
ClaimBuster	16426	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	16427	One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.	1
ClaimBuster	16428	This is a man whose plan excludes 50 million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	16429	And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	16430	I'm concerned about the fact that so many of our securities are in the hands of foreign banks because of these massive deficits.	1
ClaimBuster	16431	We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	16432	We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.	1
ClaimBuster	16433	So, I'm all for pipelines.	0
ClaimBuster	16434	My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives.	0
ClaimBuster	16435	And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	16436	When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16437	I happen to think she's a key person.	0
ClaimBuster	16438	"And a recent book that just came out by perhaps the Nation's most respected author in this field, Strobe Talbott, called ""Deadly Gambits,'' concludes that this President has failed to master the essential details needed to command and lead us, both in terms of security and terms of arms control."	1
ClaimBuster	16439	If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?	0
ClaimBuster	16440	So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16441	Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things -- [applause] -- that people need.	1
ClaimBuster	16442	One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	16443	The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them.	1
ClaimBuster	16444	I know the oil companies have been itching to do that, but it is not the right thing for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	16445	And third, credible: Ladies and gentlemen, in 1985, I was one of the first Democrats to move to balance the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	16446	The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth.	0
ClaimBuster	16447	So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	16448	And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we're making a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	16449	I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	16450	You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this.	0
ClaimBuster	16451	It has to be helped, has to be fixed.	0
ClaimBuster	16452	Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there.	1
ClaimBuster	16453	Could be wrong, but I think so.	0
ClaimBuster	16454	Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home.	0
ClaimBuster	16455	That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	16456	But there are two main focal points of this election.	0
ClaimBuster	16457	Now, the priorities are just very different.	0
ClaimBuster	16458	We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.	0
ClaimBuster	16459	And it's not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go.	0
ClaimBuster	16460	He said he was going to lower tax rates.	1
ClaimBuster	16461	I am talking of taking the treaty back, and going back into negotiations.	0
ClaimBuster	16462	Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.	0
ClaimBuster	16463	He believes in deregulation in every circumstance.	1
ClaimBuster	16464	The fact is, the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than it's been since 1929.	1
ClaimBuster	16465	Mr. President, let me finish.	0
ClaimBuster	16466	We took the Senate report, of course.	1
ClaimBuster	16467	If you're a company in St. Louis working, trying to make jobs here, there is actually an incentive for you to go away.	0
ClaimBuster	16468	I think it depends on what we do.	0
ClaimBuster	16469	And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.	1
ClaimBuster	16470	I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	16471	I hope they'll think it's good that democracy and freedom is on the move.	0
ClaimBuster	16472	We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff.	1
ClaimBuster	16473	What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget.	1
ClaimBuster	16474	Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.	0
ClaimBuster	16475	There are different ideas -- the Bush plan, the Perot plan, the Clinton -- we have different ideas.	0
ClaimBuster	16476	But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	16477	I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.	0
ClaimBuster	16478	This is about getting jobs for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	16479	And I think we're all together on that.	0
ClaimBuster	16480	Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.	0
ClaimBuster	16481	Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening.	0
ClaimBuster	16482	The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues.	0
ClaimBuster	16483	I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	16484	I don't think we agree on that.	0
ClaimBuster	16485	Before I decided to run, I had to resolve two issues in my mind.	0
ClaimBuster	16486	That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.	0
ClaimBuster	16487	My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling.	1
ClaimBuster	16488	And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.	0
ClaimBuster	16489	And what I'm about to say is unclassified.	0
ClaimBuster	16490	So we need to have fixed-cost contracts.	0
ClaimBuster	16491	I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.	1
ClaimBuster	16492	Is that the kind of leadership we need?	0
ClaimBuster	16493	Jim, let me tell you exactly what I'll do.	0
ClaimBuster	16494	Governor Romney, here's what we did.	0
ClaimBuster	16495	We're going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible.	0
ClaimBuster	16496	As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position.	0
ClaimBuster	16497	The time for campaign funding reform is after the election.	0
ClaimBuster	16498	And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.	0
ClaimBuster	16499	Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century.	1
ClaimBuster	16500	I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.	0
ClaimBuster	16501	You have to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	16502	They learn to think well or poorly of themselves in the first 18 months.	1
ClaimBuster	16503	But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.	0
ClaimBuster	16504	We want a peaceful planet.	0
ClaimBuster	16505	And yet last year we gave them less than five percent of all the technical assistance funds that we distributed around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	16506	I don't think we want to get to how he's going to pay for all these promises.	0
ClaimBuster	16507	I know how to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	16508	But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.	0
ClaimBuster	16509	It's a tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16510	We don't have an alternative.	0
ClaimBuster	16511	Making sure that we've got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.	0
ClaimBuster	16512	No, I wouldn't do away with all - uh business deductions.	0
ClaimBuster	16513	But here's something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	16514	When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	16515	He has no respect for her.	0
ClaimBuster	16516	That's exactly where the tax cuts went.	1
ClaimBuster	16517	By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth.	0
ClaimBuster	16518	Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it.	1
ClaimBuster	16519	It's called make America great again.	0
ClaimBuster	16520	"Call me, let me know."""	0
ClaimBuster	16521	Well, Milosevic has lost the election.	1
ClaimBuster	16522	In addition to what you mentioned, they also were concerned about this all-powerful central government in Washington, D.C., that'd in effect confiscate your property, so -- I carry it in my pocket -- I can't pull it out or I'd violate the rules -- a copy of the Tenth Amendment which says we ought to return power to the states and the people, the people here.	0
ClaimBuster	16523	But the main thing is he still didn't get it, from what he said the other night to that fine woman on our program, the 209 people in Richmond.	0
ClaimBuster	16524	Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we're able to sustain our defenses; it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	16525	But I've always tried in whatever I've done is to bring people together.	0
ClaimBuster	16526	You've gone up, in Missouri, about $3,500.	1
ClaimBuster	16527	And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.	1
ClaimBuster	16528	And you should go down and take a look at that.	0
ClaimBuster	16529	Margaret, I'm not sure I can get all of this in in one minute.	0
ClaimBuster	16530	I don't blame him, because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built, than any year since 1940.	1
ClaimBuster	16531	The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result.	1
ClaimBuster	16532	I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.	0
ClaimBuster	16533	I think that we're out in front of most -- and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue.	0
ClaimBuster	16534	One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt?	1
ClaimBuster	16535	And Ross properly says, okay, there's some pain in that.	0
ClaimBuster	16536	Our policy was not to cut subsidies.	0
ClaimBuster	16537	She's given money back to the taxpayers.	1
ClaimBuster	16538	Let's look at the position.	0
ClaimBuster	16539	And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we've got real (inaudible).	1
ClaimBuster	16540	Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.	1
ClaimBuster	16541	You'll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	16542	I'm interested in working with our nations and do a lot of it.	0
ClaimBuster	16543	I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.	0
ClaimBuster	16544	And Senator Obama, it's good to be with you at a town hall meeting.	0
ClaimBuster	16545	As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?	0
ClaimBuster	16546	The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be -- need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts.	0
ClaimBuster	16547	There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	16548	I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate.	0
ClaimBuster	16549	I make no bones about it.	0
ClaimBuster	16550	But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.	0
ClaimBuster	16551	Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere.	0
ClaimBuster	16552	And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.	0
ClaimBuster	16553	We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost.	0
ClaimBuster	16554	I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life.	0
ClaimBuster	16555	Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they're poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference.	0
ClaimBuster	16556	I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	16557	And we have this arms race underway.	0
ClaimBuster	16558	I talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead.	1
ClaimBuster	16559	Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now.	1
ClaimBuster	16560	I strongly support term limits for members of the US Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	16561	So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	16562	I do not for a moment think I'm entitled to all the credit for all the good things that have happened in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16563	That's not what I have.	0
ClaimBuster	16564	He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him.	0
ClaimBuster	16565	... million new jobs, a balanced budget...	0
ClaimBuster	16566	This isn't going to blow a hole in the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	16567	The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past.	1
ClaimBuster	16568	When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euro's value has been dropping, but seems to be under control.	1
ClaimBuster	16569	I'm going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me.	0
ClaimBuster	16570	But it is -- the basic structure is sound.	0
ClaimBuster	16571	Our plan will balance the budget, grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education.	0
ClaimBuster	16572	If you don't have health insurance, then what we're going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.	0
ClaimBuster	16573	So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16574	I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.	1
ClaimBuster	16575	I have given every bit of evidence, answered every question that's as- been asked me by any senator or any member of the House.	1
ClaimBuster	16576	Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words.	0
ClaimBuster	16577	And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China.	0
ClaimBuster	16578	We can't coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.	1
ClaimBuster	16579	And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails.	0
ClaimBuster	16580	What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	16581	But very specifically the key thing is to turn the government back to the people and take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve.	0
ClaimBuster	16582	That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.	0
ClaimBuster	16583	Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	16584	If you take a patient into the hospital that's bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding.	0
ClaimBuster	16585	More money is needed and I spend more money, but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind.	0
ClaimBuster	16586	My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component.	1
ClaimBuster	16587	I don't think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools.	0
ClaimBuster	16588	That's what we caught him doing.	1
ClaimBuster	16589	Not all this back and forth, you voted this way, you voted that way, we want a better America as we go into the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	16590	The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.	1
ClaimBuster	16591	My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy's and Condell (ph) Airlines and come out stronger.	1
ClaimBuster	16592	We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.	1
ClaimBuster	16593	So I will keep on as president trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT Round, the big Uruguay Round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture particularly.	0
ClaimBuster	16594	China and India were exempted from that treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	16595	We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much.	0
ClaimBuster	16596	That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary.	0
ClaimBuster	16597	I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.	0
ClaimBuster	16598	I've done a lot of things that were controversial.	1
ClaimBuster	16599	We'll produce more coal this year than any year in history.	1
ClaimBuster	16600	That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	16601	We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President.	1
ClaimBuster	16602	The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.	0
ClaimBuster	16603	He said that by now we'd have unemployment at 5.4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16604	We have to guard our energy companies.	0
ClaimBuster	16605	I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up.	0
ClaimBuster	16606	And a month or so ago I did uh - likewise say over the next ten years we should expand - double - this national parks, the wild wilderness areas, the scenic river areas.	1
ClaimBuster	16607	But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better.	1
ClaimBuster	16608	Now, when you out-spend Congress you're really swinging.	0
ClaimBuster	16609	When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.	1
ClaimBuster	16610	I have no loans from Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	16611	And I think it's the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today.	0
ClaimBuster	16612	But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that.	0
ClaimBuster	16613	We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.	0
ClaimBuster	16614	Up until about $70,000, as you go up the ladder, my proposals will be far more beneficial.	1
ClaimBuster	16615	Let's reform it and fund it.	0
ClaimBuster	16616	I think credibility is important.	0
ClaimBuster	16617	Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	16618	Mr. Ford has uh - misquoted an AP uh - news story that was in error to begin with.	1
ClaimBuster	16619	And I think it's time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	16620	One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax.	1
ClaimBuster	16621	If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world.	0
ClaimBuster	16622	I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family.	0
ClaimBuster	16623	And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.	1
ClaimBuster	16624	It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where we've got to make those kinds of choices.	0
ClaimBuster	16625	If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.	0
ClaimBuster	16626	At the present time we're at peace.	0
ClaimBuster	16627	They're watching what we do, what we say, what we promise and what we finally deliver.	0
ClaimBuster	16628	Capital gains, investment tax allowance, credit for first- time homebuyers.	0
ClaimBuster	16629	They don't name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasn't shown up to many meetings.	1
ClaimBuster	16630	And we've reached out to young people and their families and been able to help them by beginning drug education and prevention in the early elementary grades.	1
ClaimBuster	16631	So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	16632	And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	16633	I think we ought to attack our country's problems, not attack each other.	0
ClaimBuster	16634	And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president.	0
ClaimBuster	16635	That's why we want an economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	16636	They have been our friend since their inception as a nation.	1
ClaimBuster	16637	Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.	0
ClaimBuster	16638	We're going to grow some of these jobs in America, because we need to get it -- they're going the wrong way.	0
ClaimBuster	16639	But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.	0
ClaimBuster	16640	I'm also very tough on violent crime.	0
ClaimBuster	16641	Well, I don't know of any perfect solution.	0
ClaimBuster	16642	Who's the best person to get results and not talk?	0
ClaimBuster	16643	I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment.	0
ClaimBuster	16644	Look, Governor Romney's called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he's going to pay for by closing deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	16645	I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	16646	And I will not stop in our efforts to hunt down and kill the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	16647	Well, the other day, Vice President Bush disclosed his tax returns to the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	16648	Yes, I'd be glad to.	0
ClaimBuster	16649	But all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety.	1
ClaimBuster	16650	That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.	1
ClaimBuster	16651	So it seems to me that we can talk about what we call Kenny, the great exaggerator.	0
ClaimBuster	16652	I think it's time America started moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	16653	One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.	0
ClaimBuster	16654	But I got a better plan.	0
ClaimBuster	16655	And that was now all on tape, started by her.	1
ClaimBuster	16656	Which means, of course, that uh - we will have to maintain an adequate military capability - which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh - I think uh - a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces - adequate conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	16657	Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...	0
ClaimBuster	16658	We'd better wait and see what the results are.	0
ClaimBuster	16659	He's broken it three times in the past year already.	1
ClaimBuster	16660	But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	16661	He talked about children whose parents don't speak English as a first language?	1
ClaimBuster	16662	They are now operating in 60 countries.	1
ClaimBuster	16663	And we'll get our economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	16664	I've made that clear throughout my presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	16665	The use of cocaine, for example, by teenagers is dramatically down.	1
ClaimBuster	16666	But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.	1
ClaimBuster	16667	This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system.	0
ClaimBuster	16668	And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	16669	Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party.	1
ClaimBuster	16670	Now here is the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	16671	It is now running at 12.7%.	1
ClaimBuster	16672	And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that.	0
ClaimBuster	16673	And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	16674	We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record.	1
ClaimBuster	16675	We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions.	0
ClaimBuster	16676	The test is, are you doing everything possible to make America safe?	0
ClaimBuster	16677	Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president.	1
ClaimBuster	16678	All I'm saying is if you spend money, show us results and test every year, which you do not do, Mr. Vice President.	1
ClaimBuster	16679	I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal.	0
ClaimBuster	16680	We've got to deal with things like racial profiling.	0
ClaimBuster	16681	No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd.	0
ClaimBuster	16682	Making life so miserable on folks that they'll leave.	0
ClaimBuster	16683	Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts.	1
ClaimBuster	16684	It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	16685	It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.	1
ClaimBuster	16686	I'm only reducing the amount of the increase.	0
ClaimBuster	16687	And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	16688	But it doesn't take just a quiet uh - dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law.	0
ClaimBuster	16689	She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	16690	Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.	1
ClaimBuster	16691	Don't forget what he tried to do with health care.	0
ClaimBuster	16692	I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	16693	Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.	0
ClaimBuster	16694	We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	16695	And some would say maybe me more so than others.	0
ClaimBuster	16696	And that's an image of strength -- except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on -- he was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	16697	And they get health care.	1
ClaimBuster	16698	I believe Washington ought to set standards, but again I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and I think we ought to work with people at the local levels.	0
ClaimBuster	16699	I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.	0
ClaimBuster	16700	That's the wrong way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	16701	Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks.	0
ClaimBuster	16702	They're still number one today.	1
ClaimBuster	16703	We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out.	1
ClaimBuster	16704	We'd put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	16705	You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.	1
ClaimBuster	16706	Chris Reeve is a friend of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	16707	Whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time.	0
ClaimBuster	16708	He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.	1
ClaimBuster	16709	The HMO, the insurance company, can't gag that doctor from giving you full advice.	1
ClaimBuster	16710	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0
ClaimBuster	16711	On pay for teachers, on all these categories, Arkansas is right near the very bottom.	1
ClaimBuster	16712	Now I've come out with a new agenda for America's renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16713	The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field.	0
ClaimBuster	16714	It made a lot of sense.	0
ClaimBuster	16715	The president has term limits.	1
ClaimBuster	16716	I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the People's Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like.	0
ClaimBuster	16717	And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today.	1
ClaimBuster	16718	Capitalism is growing and thriving across big portions of China.	1
ClaimBuster	16719	America is the greatest place on the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	16720	Whichever place you put it.	0
ClaimBuster	16721	I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.	0
ClaimBuster	16722	Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.	1
ClaimBuster	16723	So it's one of my top priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	16724	We cannot protect countries all over the world...	0
ClaimBuster	16725	It wasn't until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking.	1
ClaimBuster	16726	That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	16727	Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry.	0
ClaimBuster	16728	But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich.	1
ClaimBuster	16729	But you're absolutely correct, it is a threat, it's a huge threat.	0
ClaimBuster	16730	And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.	0
ClaimBuster	16731	These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.	0
ClaimBuster	16732	And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it.	1
ClaimBuster	16733	I want the future, and I think we have to grab it.	0
ClaimBuster	16734	The end of the Cold War brings an incredible opportunity for change.	0
ClaimBuster	16735	I own a timber company?	0
ClaimBuster	16736	If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	16737	And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.	0
ClaimBuster	16738	I am concerned about ethnic cleansing.	0
ClaimBuster	16739	"Say, ""I made a terrible mistake."""	0
ClaimBuster	16740	I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, OK?	0
ClaimBuster	16741	And as a consequence, there's no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed.	0
ClaimBuster	16742	I think the government's spending too much.	0
ClaimBuster	16743	If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	16744	She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.	0
ClaimBuster	16745	And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	16746	No one can be opposed to alternate energy.	0
ClaimBuster	16747	And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	16748	I believe in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	16749	It hurts the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	16750	And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	16751	It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned.	1
ClaimBuster	16752	We've been challenged, and we've risen to those challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	16753	We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.	1
ClaimBuster	16754	And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.	1
ClaimBuster	16755	Tell Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland we're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	16756	The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down.	1
ClaimBuster	16757	And, Jim, I -- I've been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately.	0
ClaimBuster	16758	The Braves, one; the Cardinals, nothing, early on.	1
ClaimBuster	16759	And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept.	0
ClaimBuster	16760	Well, the economy is still growing slow.	1
ClaimBuster	16761	It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.	0
ClaimBuster	16762	He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	16763	I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	16764	I'd like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctor's appointment with a family member.	0
ClaimBuster	16765	And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed.	1
ClaimBuster	16766	There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.	1
ClaimBuster	16767	We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour.	0
ClaimBuster	16768	I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.	0
ClaimBuster	16769	I just think that we ought to support the decision.	0
ClaimBuster	16770	I have said again and again, and this really upsets the establishment in Washington, that we're going to inform the people in detail on the issues through an electronic town hall so that they really know what's going on.	1
ClaimBuster	16771	Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.	0
ClaimBuster	16772	You don't know who broke in to DNC.	0
ClaimBuster	16773	We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here.	0
ClaimBuster	16774	That's what the election's about.	0
ClaimBuster	16775	You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	16776	But there's a difference in terms of how we would do it.	0
ClaimBuster	16777	That shows that there's been more growth in this Administration than in its predecessor.	1
ClaimBuster	16778	If he's trying to allege that I'm a hard-hearted person and I don't care about children, he's absolutely wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	16779	And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	16780	Take a look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	16781	In other words, a President has to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	16782	Senator Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe.	0
ClaimBuster	16783	This is a government that is not serving you.	0
ClaimBuster	16784	And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it's been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.	1
ClaimBuster	16785	And I did as secretary of state.	1
ClaimBuster	16786	The President says it'll disappear automatically.	0
ClaimBuster	16787	Recently Ian Smith, the uh - president of uh - Rhodesia, announced that he had unequivocal commitments from Mr. Kissinger that he could not reveal.	1
ClaimBuster	16788	She's been doing it a long time.	0
ClaimBuster	16789	And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender.	0
ClaimBuster	16790	We're going to have a lot of free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	16791	And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	16792	If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted.	0
ClaimBuster	16793	Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war.	1
ClaimBuster	16794	I don't want to embarrass our oldest daughter.	0
ClaimBuster	16795	I'm going to be able to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	16796	Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	16797	Cracking down on China when they cheat.	0
ClaimBuster	16798	And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down.	1
ClaimBuster	16799	We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.	0
ClaimBuster	16800	And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess.	1
ClaimBuster	16801	So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	16802	I believe we can and we ought to.	0
ClaimBuster	16803	And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse.	0
ClaimBuster	16804	He's made these claims repeatedly.	1
ClaimBuster	16805	And that's why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year.	1
ClaimBuster	16806	And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.	1
ClaimBuster	16807	But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	16808	-- -- and the people of the Soviet Union want it to stop.	0
ClaimBuster	16809	New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	16810	It's long overdue time to raise the minimum wage.	0
ClaimBuster	16811	You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested.	0
ClaimBuster	16812	We have now uh - for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government.	1
ClaimBuster	16813	Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	16814	So we've talked about our responsibility tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	16815	I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.	1
ClaimBuster	16816	And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.	1
ClaimBuster	16817	He lost the Wisconsin primary.	1
ClaimBuster	16818	I could do a better job.	0
ClaimBuster	16819	And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?	0
ClaimBuster	16820	In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.	1
ClaimBuster	16821	They asked for the tanks.	1
ClaimBuster	16822	So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.	0
ClaimBuster	16823	They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture.	1
ClaimBuster	16824	He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	16825	And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh - the American people, the Congress have been excluded.	0
ClaimBuster	16826	I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.	0
ClaimBuster	16827	The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space.	0
ClaimBuster	16828	We're selling everything from from -- from telephones to CDs to rice in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	16829	Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.	0
ClaimBuster	16830	"In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: ""The treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area."""	1
ClaimBuster	16831	We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	16832	It seems to me that we ought to support the California civil rights initiative.	0
ClaimBuster	16833	In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	16834	We've gotta get this country growing again and this economy strong again or we can't bring down the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	16835	The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	16836	We are playing the leadership role.	0
ClaimBuster	16837	And let me give you an example of what I mean.	0
ClaimBuster	16838	The world√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s coming together, as I said, they're looking to us.	0
ClaimBuster	16839	Basically it means they can't learn.	0
ClaimBuster	16840	And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for are already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements.	1
ClaimBuster	16841	I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program.	1
ClaimBuster	16842	I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service.	0
ClaimBuster	16843	Now, we're going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	16844	It needs to be available for emergency situations.	0
ClaimBuster	16845	We were not promoting democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	16846	But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority.	1
ClaimBuster	16847	And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.	1
ClaimBuster	16848	If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.	1
ClaimBuster	16849	It's time for a new path.	0
ClaimBuster	16850	Now, I think we can do ethically guided embryonic stem-cell research.	0
ClaimBuster	16851	Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we've been investing in; but also, we've got to make sure we're building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now.	0
ClaimBuster	16852	We have 11 million undocumented people.	1
ClaimBuster	16853	"But I'm going to violate that rule and say ""never.''"	0
ClaimBuster	16854	And this used to be a bipartisan issue.	1
ClaimBuster	16855	That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	16856	And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	16857	Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today.	0
ClaimBuster	16858	And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.	0
ClaimBuster	16859	Don't forget, what's key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and I'm going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they -- they follow the law and play by the rules, but it's also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds.	1
ClaimBuster	16860	What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief.	0
ClaimBuster	16861	You may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but I've got news for you.	0
ClaimBuster	16862	But this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heaven's sakes.	0
ClaimBuster	16863	And the way to do that is to increase our exports.	0
ClaimBuster	16864	That is, I want to bring down rates.	0
ClaimBuster	16865	I don't check it that often.	1
ClaimBuster	16866	This president is the first president ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP.	1
ClaimBuster	16867	First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	16868	And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and I'll sit down with them and say let's get this done.	0
ClaimBuster	16869	And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.	0
ClaimBuster	16870	One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we'll get to later on because that is the most important single issue in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	16871	It'll be a vital issue in my second term.	0
ClaimBuster	16872	And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.	0
ClaimBuster	16873	So there are many, many heroes in this country today.	0
ClaimBuster	16874	We wanted to tie it to Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	16875	I'm absolutely opposed to a national health care plan.	0
ClaimBuster	16876	My average in two years is twenty-six.	1
ClaimBuster	16877	Now, let me just give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	16878	And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	16879	But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.	0
ClaimBuster	16880	We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the -- the record, you look at the record.	0
ClaimBuster	16881	But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan.	0
ClaimBuster	16882	And he can insult General Scowcroft if he wants to.	0
ClaimBuster	16883	As a matter of fact, there's been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating.	1
ClaimBuster	16884	You go to the heart of America's worries tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	16885	A whole bunch of folks in America are concerned about the way the Patriot Act has been applied.	0
ClaimBuster	16886	Another point I wanna make is this.	0
ClaimBuster	16887	So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	16888	No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job.	0
ClaimBuster	16889	Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	16890	But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don't help small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	16891	But I don't think it's fair to say, you haven't had cancer.	0
ClaimBuster	16892	I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	16893	And that for them is a catastrophically low number.	1
ClaimBuster	16894	But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.	0
ClaimBuster	16895	Look, it's just not true.	0
ClaimBuster	16896	The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.	0
ClaimBuster	16897	We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.	1
ClaimBuster	16898	I told you I'd cut taxes for small businesses, and I have.	1
ClaimBuster	16899	He voted against student loans; he voted against my improved student loan plan; he voted against the National Service bill, against the HeadStart bill; he voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools.	1
ClaimBuster	16900	You won't slow defense spending; you refuse to do that -- --	0
ClaimBuster	16901	So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	16902	It is the number one culprit.	0
ClaimBuster	16903	And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban.	1
ClaimBuster	16904	And they're either going to be destroyed or left frozen.	0
ClaimBuster	16905	I have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.	1
ClaimBuster	16906	I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.	0
ClaimBuster	16907	But I think that one area we agree on is the important of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they are less likely to engage in these kinds of violent acts.	0
ClaimBuster	16908	Donald doesn't agree with that.	1
ClaimBuster	16909	We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks.	0
ClaimBuster	16910	But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	16911	Governor Romney, that's not what you said...	1
ClaimBuster	16912	The man is practicing fuzzy math again.	0
ClaimBuster	16913	I know they're popular, but I'm against them.	0
ClaimBuster	16914	Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still holding themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our nation its strength.	1
ClaimBuster	16915	Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was.	1
ClaimBuster	16916	Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.	0
ClaimBuster	16917	To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.	0
ClaimBuster	16918	And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...	0
ClaimBuster	16919	It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business.	0
ClaimBuster	16920	It's not just a threat -- threat to the state of Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	16921	And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you're specifically including conservation and protection of the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	16922	I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we're going to get serious in terms of research.	0
ClaimBuster	16923	We did, 25 percent across the board.	1
ClaimBuster	16924	Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land.	1
ClaimBuster	16925	Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out.	1
ClaimBuster	16926	Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	16927	And I agree, it works extremely well now.	0
ClaimBuster	16928	It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.	1
ClaimBuster	16929	How you can cut school lunches, how you can cut student assistance, how you can cut housing, how you can cut disability benefits, how you can do all of these things and then the people receiving them -- for example, the disabled, who have no alternative -- how they're going to do better, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	16930	It is not a government takeover.	0
ClaimBuster	16931	I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible.	1
ClaimBuster	16932	I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun.	0
ClaimBuster	16933	I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.	0
ClaimBuster	16934	He noted a few, but there are others.	0
ClaimBuster	16935	They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.	1
ClaimBuster	16936	"General Ridgway said - who was Chief of Staff: ""To go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take."	1
ClaimBuster	16937	And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.	1
ClaimBuster	16938	And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out.	1
ClaimBuster	16939	I was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	16940	With respect to North Korea, the real story: We had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	16941	The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	16942	More than ever, we need to be united as a country.	0
ClaimBuster	16943	In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	16944	It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.	0
ClaimBuster	16945	But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%.	1
ClaimBuster	16946	... talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.	1
ClaimBuster	16947	You decided to stay home, and that's OK.	0
ClaimBuster	16948	We ought to do the same with Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	16949	I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.	0
ClaimBuster	16950	Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.	1
ClaimBuster	16951	which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.	1
ClaimBuster	16952	Libya's 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population.	1
ClaimBuster	16953	He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.	1
ClaimBuster	16954	But we're also a nation of laws.	1
ClaimBuster	16955	most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform.	0
ClaimBuster	16956	I have watched these people -- the same for our local law enforcement people.	0
ClaimBuster	16957	We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.	0
ClaimBuster	16958	I see it as a serious problem.	0
ClaimBuster	16959	When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.	1
ClaimBuster	16960	That adds up to 44 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	16961	I would also consider arming the Kurds.	0
ClaimBuster	16962	But where I differ with my opponent is I am not going to make unilateral cuts in our strategic defend systems or support some freeze when they have superiority.	0
ClaimBuster	16963	(Applause) And so I'm still a little unclear as to whether he's for or against the tax increase.	0
ClaimBuster	16964	In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.	1
ClaimBuster	16965	I was asked a technical question.	1
ClaimBuster	16966	There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.	1
ClaimBuster	16967	We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools.	0
ClaimBuster	16968	Mr. Ford's own uh - environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he's uh - president.	1
ClaimBuster	16969	The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada.	1
ClaimBuster	16970	You don't get any gun.	0
ClaimBuster	16971	And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution.	1
ClaimBuster	16972	Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.	1
ClaimBuster	16973	I was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.	1
ClaimBuster	16974	We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	16975	Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir.	0
ClaimBuster	16976	But we must all decide first we have the courage to change for hope and a better tomorrow.	0
ClaimBuster	16977	I believe in the President's commission on outdoors.	0
ClaimBuster	16978	He said here were all these intellectuals out there griping and complaining and saying it was negative coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	16979	I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina, Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	16980	Look, I've been in business for 25 years.	1
ClaimBuster	16981	Today, 47 million people on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	16982	The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.	1
ClaimBuster	16983	I want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans.	0
ClaimBuster	16984	But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.	0
ClaimBuster	16985	As a matter of fact, the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggerated -- over exaggerated.	1
ClaimBuster	16986	I wish he could have been with me when I sat with a group of teenagers who were black, and who were telling me about their unemployment problems, and that it was the minimum wage that had done away with the jobs that they once could get.	1
ClaimBuster	16987	Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.	1
ClaimBuster	16988	You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?	1
ClaimBuster	16989	I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark.	0
ClaimBuster	16990	Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didn't mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasn't his own bill.	1
ClaimBuster	16991	And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things.	0
ClaimBuster	16992	He voted against the first Gulf War.	1
ClaimBuster	16993	And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.	0
ClaimBuster	16994	I'm not for command and control techniques either.	1
ClaimBuster	16995	The fact of the matter is if the Pledge of Allegiance was the acid test of one's patriotism--the vice president's been the presiding officer in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years.	0
ClaimBuster	16996	I am concerned about the fact that 10 percent of our manufacturing and 20 percent of our banking and nearly half of the real estate in the city of Los Angeles are in the hands of foreign investors.	1
ClaimBuster	16997	Now we've increased that amount 25 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	16998	Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.	0
ClaimBuster	16999	I believe that when you know something's going wrong, you make it right.	0
ClaimBuster	17000	I'm a year ahead of schedule.	1
ClaimBuster	17001	We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands.	0
ClaimBuster	17002	But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	17003	It is something one would only - only consider if all of the other avenues had been -- had been tried to their full extent.	0
ClaimBuster	17004	It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this.	1
ClaimBuster	17005	And you're right, I haven't vetoed any spending bills, because we work together.	1
ClaimBuster	17006	Oh, I'm it's my question.	0
ClaimBuster	17007	Cocaine use up 160 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	17008	Well, Mr. Ford, unfortunately, has just made a statement that's not true.	1
ClaimBuster	17009	A targeted tax cut, a real commitment to educational reform.	0
ClaimBuster	17010	This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	17011	That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.	1
ClaimBuster	17012	But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.	1
ClaimBuster	17013	In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything.	0
ClaimBuster	17014	In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment.	1
ClaimBuster	17015	In the final analysis, I'm doing this for your children when you look at them tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	17016	He - we have a big difference on issues.	0
ClaimBuster	17017	We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president.	0
ClaimBuster	17018	And as I just said that I believe that the passage of the so-called Title Three, which gives the Attorney General the power to protect Constitutional rights in those cases where it's not possible for the person involved to bring the suit.	1
ClaimBuster	17019	But they didn't have much of a partner in government here as compared with the policies the Germans and the Japanese followed, and I believe we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	17020	But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it.	0
ClaimBuster	17021	I don't think the National Rifle Association ran that ad.	0
ClaimBuster	17022	Somewhere in between those numbers -- and so there's a difference, what he's promised and what he can raise.	1
ClaimBuster	17023	Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself.	1
ClaimBuster	17024	That's not how America was built.	0
ClaimBuster	17025	Young people are looking to us.	0
ClaimBuster	17026	And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.	0
ClaimBuster	17027	And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	17028	And there's a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.	1
ClaimBuster	17029	Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.	1
ClaimBuster	17030	That's not going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	17031	That's not a way to invite people.	0
ClaimBuster	17032	Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region.	0
ClaimBuster	17033	He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote.	1
ClaimBuster	17034	And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.	1
ClaimBuster	17035	And fortunately the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there.	1
ClaimBuster	17036	And I think it's her campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	17037	If we keep somebody -- you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	17038	Mr. McGee, we have a contractual right to be in Berlin coming out of the conversations at Potsdam and of World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	17039	And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.	1
ClaimBuster	17040	We've got to make things here.	0
ClaimBuster	17041	And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference.	1
ClaimBuster	17042	Now none of that will happen anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	17043	I would say to them, look at the job retraining programs that we're proposing.	0
ClaimBuster	17044	And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	17045	Now, what we haven't talked about is Senator McCain's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	17046	I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.	0
ClaimBuster	17047	Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.	0
ClaimBuster	17048	So we can have a tax cut but my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	17049	They're breaking business's legs in a number of different ways.	0
ClaimBuster	17050	It has not worked for America.	0
ClaimBuster	17051	George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy.	1
ClaimBuster	17052	And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families.	0
ClaimBuster	17053	Now, I'm going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military, and I'm going to make people feel good about being safe in our military, and not overextended, because I'm going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did, President Eisenhower did, and others.	0
ClaimBuster	17054	Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing.	0
ClaimBuster	17055	How do we get schools to be more competitive?	0
ClaimBuster	17056	We are not a nation in decline.	0
ClaimBuster	17057	General Petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility, where he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used.	1
ClaimBuster	17058	An I don't think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe.	0
ClaimBuster	17059	No, I didn't say that at all.	1
ClaimBuster	17060	But what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	17061	I support a woman's right to choose.	1
ClaimBuster	17062	Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year.	1
ClaimBuster	17063	And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.	1
ClaimBuster	17064	And it's very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we're not doing what we need to do...	0
ClaimBuster	17065	I want to fully fund education, No Child Left Behind, special-needs education.	0
ClaimBuster	17066	It's all covered in the plan.	1
ClaimBuster	17067	This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.	0
ClaimBuster	17068	I was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values, and grandparents.	1
ClaimBuster	17069	For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service.	1
ClaimBuster	17070	It is because America has not invested in its people.	0
ClaimBuster	17071	But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed.	0
ClaimBuster	17072	We're lucky to have her heading the commission.	0
ClaimBuster	17073	That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.	0
ClaimBuster	17074	Our conventional strength in Europe is under strength.	1
ClaimBuster	17075	We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.	1
ClaimBuster	17076	We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home.	0
ClaimBuster	17077	The world is more dangerous today.	0
ClaimBuster	17078	This has got to be stopped.	0
ClaimBuster	17079	Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny.	1
ClaimBuster	17080	So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know.	0
ClaimBuster	17081	But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if I'm elected president.	0
ClaimBuster	17082	Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program -- a lot of you may not know this -- it produces a $70 billion surplus a year.	1
ClaimBuster	17083	I believe we can be successful.	0
ClaimBuster	17084	They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.	0
ClaimBuster	17085	That's why we don't have full employment today.	0
ClaimBuster	17086	We need a program for the uninsured.	0
ClaimBuster	17087	One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	17088	Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program.	0
ClaimBuster	17089	It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.	0
ClaimBuster	17090	Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children.	1
ClaimBuster	17091	We didn't have enough forces.	0
ClaimBuster	17092	He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups.	0
ClaimBuster	17093	And so, I think that the lines can meet.	0
ClaimBuster	17094	The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	17095	I don't believe Hillary will.	0
ClaimBuster	17096	Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life.	0
ClaimBuster	17097	He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost.	1
ClaimBuster	17098	Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this.	0
ClaimBuster	17099	We cut the rate of increase in spending in half.	1
ClaimBuster	17100	And by the way, I just want to make sure -- I can't let him just say something and not correct it.	0
ClaimBuster	17101	This is public ethics; I'm not talking about private ethics.	0
ClaimBuster	17102	The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	17103	And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored.	0
ClaimBuster	17104	For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear.	0
ClaimBuster	17105	And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and all the people who are watching.	0
ClaimBuster	17106	But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	17107	Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17108	Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government.	1
ClaimBuster	17109	Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals.	1
ClaimBuster	17110	If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider.	0
ClaimBuster	17111	I'm the first president ever to allow funding -- federal funding -- for embryonic stem-cell research.	1
ClaimBuster	17112	If you've got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	17113	I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources.	1
ClaimBuster	17114	People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick.	0
ClaimBuster	17115	I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	17116	With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.	1
ClaimBuster	17117	You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.	1
ClaimBuster	17118	Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze.	1
ClaimBuster	17119	I hope I've earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character.	0
ClaimBuster	17120	Her husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too.	0
ClaimBuster	17121	To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year.	1
ClaimBuster	17122	When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	17123	What grade do you teach?	0
ClaimBuster	17124	Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.	0
ClaimBuster	17125	But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	17126	In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president.	1
ClaimBuster	17127	I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so we're out front.	0
ClaimBuster	17128	That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	17129	And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	17130	I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us.	0
ClaimBuster	17131	He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today.	0
ClaimBuster	17132	I'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	17133	Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	17134	So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.	0
ClaimBuster	17135	I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose.	0
ClaimBuster	17136	And I'm so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there.	0
ClaimBuster	17137	Because you're going to decide whether we're going to balance the budget now, but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	17138	Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	17139	But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace.	0
ClaimBuster	17140	And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	17141	And the result was unilateral disarmament.	1
ClaimBuster	17142	Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.	1
ClaimBuster	17143	See, here is the mentality.	0
ClaimBuster	17144	And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldn't you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better?	0
ClaimBuster	17145	U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success.	0
ClaimBuster	17146	I'll never turn over America's national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	17147	But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	17148	I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels we've come up with are just about right.	0
ClaimBuster	17149	And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently.	1
ClaimBuster	17150	But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	17151	You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that?	0
ClaimBuster	17152	This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	17153	Now, we're not a parliamentary body, the National Governors Association.	1
ClaimBuster	17154	And it would've put uh - very strict uh - uh - control over who owned a handgun.	0
ClaimBuster	17155	In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.	0
ClaimBuster	17156	It's a matter of leadership or no leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	17157	Nobody's ever seen that before.	0
ClaimBuster	17158	If the -- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it's 7.8 percent now.	1
ClaimBuster	17159	Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union.	1
ClaimBuster	17160	I would go after Baghdadi.	0
ClaimBuster	17161	But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual.	0
ClaimBuster	17162	We are not doing that today.	0
ClaimBuster	17163	And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.	0
ClaimBuster	17164	With regard to the employer sanctions, we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal aliens, but also, while some keep protesting about what it would do to employers, there is another employer that we shouldn't be so concerned about, and these are employers down through the years who have encouraged the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individuals and hire them at starvation wages and with none of the benefits that we think are normal and natural for workers in our country, and the individuals can't complain because of their illegal status.	0
ClaimBuster	17165	It was in 1964 and that's what he called Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	17166	And so we can be a partner with China.	0
ClaimBuster	17167	I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.	0
ClaimBuster	17168	And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.	0
ClaimBuster	17169	It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us -- the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing.	1
ClaimBuster	17170	It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership.	1
ClaimBuster	17171	And it's a bad policy.	0
ClaimBuster	17172	One is to change Head Start to a reading program.	0
ClaimBuster	17173	We took the child to New York.	1
ClaimBuster	17174	I've been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh - government is comparable.	1
ClaimBuster	17175	It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	17176	The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.	1
ClaimBuster	17177	We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	17178	-- that he's going to be responsible.	0
ClaimBuster	17179	I think if I were a senior citizen I would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans and scaring students about education.	0
ClaimBuster	17180	Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	17181	We're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	17182	Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them.	0
ClaimBuster	17183	I had never worked in Washington as an elected official.	1
ClaimBuster	17184	And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job.	0
ClaimBuster	17185	These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.	1
ClaimBuster	17186	It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	17187	It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.	1
ClaimBuster	17188	Now, to -- I still -- I just have a minute here?	0
ClaimBuster	17189	You may claim you've got mandatory testing but you don't, Mr. Vice President.	0
ClaimBuster	17190	We've got to understand in America that we've got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	17191	The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	17192	9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling.	1
ClaimBuster	17193	The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17194	(Applause) I'd like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful.	0
ClaimBuster	17195	And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11.	1
ClaimBuster	17196	I have heard you say this time after time.	0
ClaimBuster	17197	But let's look at the performance.	0
ClaimBuster	17198	And we do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when it happens on their watch and people who are in charge --	0
ClaimBuster	17199	Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?	0
ClaimBuster	17200	I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person.	0
ClaimBuster	17201	The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.	1
ClaimBuster	17202	That's -- Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China.	0
ClaimBuster	17203	We know how to get control of the debt.	0
ClaimBuster	17204	I don't think that's true at all.	0
ClaimBuster	17205	And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.	0
ClaimBuster	17206	And talk about not quitting, I'm spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money.	1
ClaimBuster	17207	I only have 30 seconds.	1
ClaimBuster	17208	[Laughter] If they're antisatellite weapons, I assume they're going to be aimed against satellites.	0
ClaimBuster	17209	And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.	0
ClaimBuster	17210	But look who's around with him there.	0
ClaimBuster	17211	Then a lot of mutual distrust developed.	0
ClaimBuster	17212	We cannot afford an intelligence gap.	0
ClaimBuster	17213	Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.	1
ClaimBuster	17214	Instead, I want to build the Midgetman, which is mobile and thus less vulnerable, contributing to stability, and a weapon that will give us security and contribute to an incentive for arms control.	0
ClaimBuster	17215	The Reagan-Bush administration was right.	0
ClaimBuster	17216	And I do believe it would be inhibiting.	0
ClaimBuster	17217	So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.	0
ClaimBuster	17218	And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.	0
ClaimBuster	17219	I've been a tolerant person all my life.	0
ClaimBuster	17220	No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.	0
ClaimBuster	17221	And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.	0
ClaimBuster	17222	We've got to stop some of these frivolous lawsuits.	0
ClaimBuster	17223	Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties.	0
ClaimBuster	17224	It's what we stand for.	0
ClaimBuster	17225	Back to Iran, just for a second.	0
ClaimBuster	17226	Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our government $28 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	17227	And in a war, there's a lot of -- there's a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say: He shouldn't have done that.	0
ClaimBuster	17228	Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.	1
ClaimBuster	17229	But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.	0
ClaimBuster	17230	Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.	0
ClaimBuster	17231	That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	17232	And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we're in a race for survival - a race in which it isn't enough to be ahead; it isn't enough simply to be complacent.	0
ClaimBuster	17233	And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.	0
ClaimBuster	17234	Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence.	0
ClaimBuster	17235	Now there's what's called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first.	1
ClaimBuster	17236	We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	17237	I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.	0
ClaimBuster	17238	That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy.	0
ClaimBuster	17239	See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business.	0
ClaimBuster	17240	But we're going to have to use more gas, more coal and more safe nuclear power for our energy base.	0
ClaimBuster	17241	It leaves a hundred miles between the sea.	1
ClaimBuster	17242	If we do those things we will build that bridge to the 21st Century and the greatest country in history will be even greater.	0
ClaimBuster	17243	It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.	1
ClaimBuster	17244	We all know the possibility of terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	17245	Growth in the economy is gonna add to the overall prosperity and wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	17246	Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	17247	The major threat is external and will continue.	0
ClaimBuster	17248	But this president hasn't even held the kind of statesman-like summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those states.	1
ClaimBuster	17249	Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops.	0
ClaimBuster	17250	And we better be awfully careful.	0
ClaimBuster	17251	We shouldn't be using food.	0
ClaimBuster	17252	I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.	0
ClaimBuster	17253	But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	17254	It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.	0
ClaimBuster	17255	And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.	0
ClaimBuster	17256	Bundles of cash as big as this stage.	1
ClaimBuster	17257	I always believed he was a threat.	0
ClaimBuster	17258	I think it's a fundamental difference.	0
ClaimBuster	17259	So, there seems to be no shortage of investment capital.	0
ClaimBuster	17260	And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium.	1
ClaimBuster	17261	Our enterprise zones, that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress, would bring jobs into the inner city.	0
ClaimBuster	17262	And that's why we've got to make some investments and I've called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal.	1
ClaimBuster	17263	And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system.	1
ClaimBuster	17264	"But let me tell you, point blank, the lines of stem cells that he's made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, ""Not adequate,"" because they're contaminated by mouse cells, and because there aren't 60 or 70 -- they're are only about 11 to 20 now -- and there aren't enough to be able to do the research because they're contaminated."	1
ClaimBuster	17265	My hope for America is a prosperous America, a hopeful America and a safer world.	0
ClaimBuster	17266	It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to.	0
ClaimBuster	17267	$665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	17268	First of all, of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us.	0
ClaimBuster	17269	And a lot of our military are underpaid.	1
ClaimBuster	17270	The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.	0
ClaimBuster	17271	There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes.	0
ClaimBuster	17272	And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good.	0
ClaimBuster	17273	And, Tom, I know that we're under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there.	0
ClaimBuster	17274	They'll pay off our national debt.	0
ClaimBuster	17275	And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	17276	But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.	1
ClaimBuster	17277	Ninety percent are on the honor role.	1
ClaimBuster	17278	Of course we're meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that.	0
ClaimBuster	17279	We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office.	1
ClaimBuster	17280	When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.	1
ClaimBuster	17281	When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that.	1
ClaimBuster	17282	We can do better than this.	0
ClaimBuster	17283	They're not the secrets to the nuclear bomb.	1
ClaimBuster	17284	We have good executive orders, and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh - uh - NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision.	0
ClaimBuster	17285	And the reason we've gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	17286	I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	17287	I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.	0
ClaimBuster	17288	Look at the evidence of the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	17289	I think they're taxed too much.	0
ClaimBuster	17290	Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	17291	Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	17292	And guess who would get shuffled through?	0
ClaimBuster	17293	I've been paying taxes just like you and Lord knows, I've paid my share -- over a billion in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	17294	She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	17295	... it's hard to get there from here.	0
ClaimBuster	17296	He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.	1
ClaimBuster	17297	I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention.	0
ClaimBuster	17298	The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans.	1
ClaimBuster	17299	And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	17300	"Not only that, he said, ""I think that's what grows the economy."""	1
ClaimBuster	17301	We're talking about a massive government, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	17302	Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession.	0
ClaimBuster	17303	I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin.	0
ClaimBuster	17304	the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact.	1
ClaimBuster	17305	This president has turned his back on the wellness of America.	0
ClaimBuster	17306	So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	17307	We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.	1
ClaimBuster	17308	... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.	1
ClaimBuster	17309	One size does not fit all.	0
ClaimBuster	17310	We will take out ISIS.	0
ClaimBuster	17311	So I'm very honored by all of that.	0
ClaimBuster	17312	And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.	0
ClaimBuster	17313	Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders.	1
ClaimBuster	17314	"And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it."""	1
ClaimBuster	17315	(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses.	1
ClaimBuster	17316	A president should be the same thing to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	17317	And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.	0
ClaimBuster	17318	And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that would've gone to uh - cities and others to control uh - water pollution.	1
ClaimBuster	17319	And what we have to do is restrain the growth of spending.	0
ClaimBuster	17320	So this is a serious threat.	0
ClaimBuster	17321	This is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when I'm president.	1
ClaimBuster	17322	Economic growth is the key to the future of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17323	I don't believe in trickle-down government, I don't believe in larger taxes and larger government spending.	0
ClaimBuster	17324	The federal government is going to run it.	0
ClaimBuster	17325	And I told Mr. Gromyko we don't like their system.	1
ClaimBuster	17326	I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	17327	It's important we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future.	0
ClaimBuster	17328	Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.	1
ClaimBuster	17329	It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?	0
ClaimBuster	17330	And he ought to be proud of it, it's part of his record.	0
ClaimBuster	17331	And Iran and Iraq are now more dangerous -- Iran and North Korea are now more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	17332	We have to be sure to maintain that.	0
ClaimBuster	17333	But who's going to get Mosul, really?	0
ClaimBuster	17334	The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.	0
ClaimBuster	17335	Well, I think -- listen, I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will, in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	17336	And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts.	1
ClaimBuster	17337	Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately.	1
ClaimBuster	17338	He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	17339	But I don't agree with a lot of - most of the positions of the ACLU.	0
ClaimBuster	17340	We've expanded trade adjustment assistance.	1
ClaimBuster	17341	Ask the people in the armed forces today.	0
ClaimBuster	17342	And the last point I just want to make.	0
ClaimBuster	17343	You don't help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	17344	The other is John Neuhaus, who's one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	17345	You know, four years ago, I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president.	1
ClaimBuster	17346	And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery.	0
ClaimBuster	17347	The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	17348	Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what?	0
ClaimBuster	17349	I've shown I know how to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	17350	We're the second biggest state -- farming state in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	17351	Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off.	1
ClaimBuster	17352	That was a terrible time for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	17353	And so, of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on Russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior.	0
ClaimBuster	17354	If you make less than $60,000 a year and you decide to invest $1,000 in a savings account, you'll get a tax credit, which means in essence that the federal government will match your $1,000 with another $1,000.	1
ClaimBuster	17355	We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.	0
ClaimBuster	17356	We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	17357	I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.	0
ClaimBuster	17358	First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	17359	But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	17360	I want you to be very happy.	0
ClaimBuster	17361	Our recession was one of the shallowest in modern history.	1
ClaimBuster	17362	And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn't do.	0
ClaimBuster	17363	But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.	1
ClaimBuster	17364	And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.	0
ClaimBuster	17365	Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and that's exactly what I'm talking about.	1
ClaimBuster	17366	And let me tell you what the record shows.	0
ClaimBuster	17367	I believe in limited government.	0
ClaimBuster	17368	First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	17369	My whole administration is about your future.	0
ClaimBuster	17370	They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits.	1
ClaimBuster	17371	Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, let's cut money out of the Defense Dept.	0
ClaimBuster	17372	I will go very quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	17373	So, this is a very difficult situation.	0
ClaimBuster	17374	Well, I've been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the governor of Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	17375	Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help.	0
ClaimBuster	17376	Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.	1
ClaimBuster	17377	And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out.	0
ClaimBuster	17378	I did it for the very reasons you say.	1
ClaimBuster	17379	And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	17380	All I want to do, if you've already got health care, is lower your costs.	0
ClaimBuster	17381	I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...	0
ClaimBuster	17382	Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	17383	We have a democracy in Portugal today.	1
ClaimBuster	17384	I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.	0
ClaimBuster	17385	Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they're making money every time you go to the pump?	0
ClaimBuster	17386	We've spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% don't.	1
ClaimBuster	17387	Winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing.	1
ClaimBuster	17388	But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes.	1
ClaimBuster	17389	I'll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	17390	I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	17391	I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.	0
ClaimBuster	17392	One-quarter of the surplus for important projects, and I want to send one-quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills.	0
ClaimBuster	17393	The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17394	My name wasn't even there.	1
ClaimBuster	17395	He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.	1
ClaimBuster	17396	And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	17397	We're not going to do that in my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	17398	I've got the scars to prove it.	1
ClaimBuster	17399	These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	17400	Today in America more minorities own a home than ever before.	1
ClaimBuster	17401	We all thought there was weapons there, Robin.	0
ClaimBuster	17402	But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	17403	It's a very proud moment for me.	0
ClaimBuster	17404	Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.	1
ClaimBuster	17405	I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to.	0
ClaimBuster	17406	And we're going to stay engaged, as long as I'm president, working to improve things.	0
ClaimBuster	17407	I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved.	1
ClaimBuster	17408	When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.	0
ClaimBuster	17409	They were presidents at historic times.	1
ClaimBuster	17410	I can remember the fires that swept Parker County, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	17411	Whether or not you have the capacity to convince people to follow?	0
ClaimBuster	17412	So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base.	0
ClaimBuster	17413	I mean that's how our free market works.	1
ClaimBuster	17414	After all, I was a border governor for a while.	1
ClaimBuster	17415	We didn't have access to their markets.	1
ClaimBuster	17416	Jim, let me just come back on that -- on that point, which is these...	0
ClaimBuster	17417	I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces.	0
ClaimBuster	17418	And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.	0
ClaimBuster	17419	And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being.	0
ClaimBuster	17420	I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	17421	We're going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million more jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17422	It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	17423	But let's -- let's mention -- let me mention the other one.	0
ClaimBuster	17424	No, I would make some changes.	0
ClaimBuster	17425	Middle-income families are being crushed.	0
ClaimBuster	17426	Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	17427	So, the polls are interesting, but uh - I don't know how to explain the fluctuation.	0
ClaimBuster	17428	I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk.	0
ClaimBuster	17429	Called James Watt an excellent Secretary of the Interior?	0
ClaimBuster	17430	And it's not tax and spend economics.	0
ClaimBuster	17431	Only about half the people in this country have pension plans.	1
ClaimBuster	17432	Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake.	0
ClaimBuster	17433	Mr. Bush says we are going to put the IRS on every taxpayer.	1
ClaimBuster	17434	Well, I believe in the town hall meetings; they started with my campaign in New Hampshire.	1
ClaimBuster	17435	It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	17436	Well, let's admit it then.	0
ClaimBuster	17437	And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that.	0
ClaimBuster	17438	I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	17439	All of the things that I said we would do, from inflation being down, interest rates being down, unemployment falling, all of those things we have done.	1
ClaimBuster	17440	So I would say just, you know, look at all three of us.	0
ClaimBuster	17441	I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	17442	But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.	1
ClaimBuster	17443	Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal.	1
ClaimBuster	17444	I don't think there are any villains inside government on this issue, but there's sure a lot of people who don't understand business.	0
ClaimBuster	17445	Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	17446	Perhaps in no area do we disagree more than this administration's policies on human rights.	0
ClaimBuster	17447	I know what it's like in dark times.	0
ClaimBuster	17448	They're murderers and some very bad people.	1
ClaimBuster	17449	Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?	0
ClaimBuster	17450	That would be my answer to this question.	0
ClaimBuster	17451	Many of them are now the contras.	1
ClaimBuster	17452	So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.	1
ClaimBuster	17453	This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.	0
ClaimBuster	17454	Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget -- no, that was no longer possible.	1
ClaimBuster	17455	Bob, anybody can play with these votes.	0
ClaimBuster	17456	The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed.	0
ClaimBuster	17457	Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans.	0
ClaimBuster	17458	We're continuing to increase manpower and equipment.	1
ClaimBuster	17459	We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.	0
ClaimBuster	17460	They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	17461	But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	17462	I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	17463	Did you hear him say that Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships?	1
ClaimBuster	17464	I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful.	0
ClaimBuster	17465	Everywhere I go on the campaign trail I see moms and dads whose son or daughter may wear the uniform and they tell me about how discouraged their son or daughter may be.	1
ClaimBuster	17466	You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking.	1
ClaimBuster	17467	But you have no plan.	0
ClaimBuster	17468	That would not start a war.	0
ClaimBuster	17469	And I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed.	0
ClaimBuster	17470	Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we'll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we'll help take care of it.	0
ClaimBuster	17471	And that's what concerns me.	0
ClaimBuster	17472	And we've got to create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	17473	This is a question of organizing the housing community.	0
ClaimBuster	17474	I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.	1
ClaimBuster	17475	I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case.	0
ClaimBuster	17476	I believe in the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	17477	So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.	0
ClaimBuster	17478	The governor has proposed skipping a generation of technology.	1
ClaimBuster	17479	And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	17480	I'm ready to sign that bill right now.	0
ClaimBuster	17481	I've been standing up to big Hollywood, big trial lawyers.	1
ClaimBuster	17482	The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.	1
ClaimBuster	17483	He -- he -- he objects...	0
ClaimBuster	17484	Let's talk about them separately.	0
ClaimBuster	17485	If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that's because it's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	17486	We must have a great goal.	0
ClaimBuster	17487	These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.	0
ClaimBuster	17488	6 billion dollars for Pell Grants, very, very important.	1
ClaimBuster	17489	And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world.	0
ClaimBuster	17490	I remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away.	1
ClaimBuster	17491	I think the American people are too.	0
ClaimBuster	17492	So that's what I'll do as president.	0
ClaimBuster	17493	If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man.	0
ClaimBuster	17494	And so will the former President, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	17495	But my job is to ask two questions, sir.	0
ClaimBuster	17496	Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didn't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we can't give money to every interest group that comes along.	1
ClaimBuster	17497	And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	17498	And we honor all the service that they've provided.	1
ClaimBuster	17499	"That's why in my speech to the Congress I said: There's an ""Axis of Evil,"" Iraq, Iran and North Korea, and we're paying attention to it."	1
ClaimBuster	17500	So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.	0
ClaimBuster	17501	We'll have 125,000 trained by the end of December.	1
ClaimBuster	17502	It's as simple as that.	0
ClaimBuster	17503	I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	17504	There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.	0
ClaimBuster	17505	And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.	1
ClaimBuster	17506	They send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down.	1
ClaimBuster	17507	And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.	1
ClaimBuster	17508	It does not put a deficit on the Treasury.	1
ClaimBuster	17509	I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people.	0
ClaimBuster	17510	Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues.	1
ClaimBuster	17511	And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2,500 per year.	1
ClaimBuster	17512	And what my worry is is that, you know, it looks like it's from Canada, and it might be from a third world.	0
ClaimBuster	17513	In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	17514	We either have a border or we don't.	0
ClaimBuster	17515	Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh - Eisenhower.	1
ClaimBuster	17516	Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	17517	I think the vast majority of Americans believe in them.	0
ClaimBuster	17518	Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.	1
ClaimBuster	17519	I've met with them, I know them, I've spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen.	1
ClaimBuster	17520	I have fought against that as a senator.	1
ClaimBuster	17521	I would disagree with it.	0
ClaimBuster	17522	Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	17523	Governor Engler of Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	17524	... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients.	1
ClaimBuster	17525	I've done it my entire life.	1
ClaimBuster	17526	Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students.	1
ClaimBuster	17527	Now, if won't be, General Waller would be -- you say, why do you keep picking military people.	0
ClaimBuster	17528	"Now, some people have said, ""Ah, that would make war imminent, because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy.''"	0
ClaimBuster	17529	We haven't done enough in terms of transit; we haven't done enough in terms of ports.	0
ClaimBuster	17530	I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy.	0
ClaimBuster	17531	I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.	0
ClaimBuster	17532	It's under, there's been no consideration of it, no discussion of it.	0
ClaimBuster	17533	What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?	0
ClaimBuster	17534	Well, I understand, and Africa is important.	0
ClaimBuster	17535	I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.	0
ClaimBuster	17536	On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	17537	Kind of gets your head straight about where the taxes, year in and year out, have gotta come from.	0
ClaimBuster	17538	You've been doing this for 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	17539	As a governor, I thought please, give me this program.	0
ClaimBuster	17540	I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've talked about.	0
ClaimBuster	17541	We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.	1
ClaimBuster	17542	It is a very difficult environment.	0
ClaimBuster	17543	And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	17544	But I have an obligation to fight to make sure there are no failing schools.	0
ClaimBuster	17545	I told them in early '95.	1
ClaimBuster	17546	I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	17547	Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it.	0
ClaimBuster	17548	I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs.	1
ClaimBuster	17549	I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.	1
ClaimBuster	17550	Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	17551	It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.	0
ClaimBuster	17552	Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities.	1
ClaimBuster	17553	And then if a little of it comes my way, they load it up with Christmas trees and tax increases, and I have to stand up and favor the taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	17554	Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration.	1
ClaimBuster	17555	And this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just can't do.	0
ClaimBuster	17556	It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	17557	That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17558	I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them.	0
ClaimBuster	17559	That's not an energy strategy for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	17560	I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history.	0
ClaimBuster	17561	That's what our message is to the people watching.	0
ClaimBuster	17562	And this was August, a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17563	Let me answer your question and I hope it doesn't get too personal or maudlin.	0
ClaimBuster	17564	Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country's dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	17565	We've had dozens we've had dozens and dozens of officials in this Administration who have left under a cloud, who have left with the special prosecutor in their arm, have been indicted, convicted.	1
ClaimBuster	17566	Part of what had happened is we'd forgotten why we had gone.	0
ClaimBuster	17567	Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	17568	Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.	0
ClaimBuster	17569	They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.	1
ClaimBuster	17570	And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region.	1
ClaimBuster	17571	My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school.	1
ClaimBuster	17572	The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can.	0
ClaimBuster	17573	The president rushed our nation to war without a plan to win the peace.	1
ClaimBuster	17574	And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17575	I think everybody knows that.	0
ClaimBuster	17576	And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.	0
ClaimBuster	17577	So I'll take the pledge and will stay on the issues.	0
ClaimBuster	17578	But when you go to put somebody else's son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there's a military plan that can do this.	0
ClaimBuster	17579	A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	17580	I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.	0
ClaimBuster	17581	Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form but I don't favor creating special rights for any group.	0
ClaimBuster	17582	That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.	0
ClaimBuster	17583	I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.	0
ClaimBuster	17584	Every 12-year-old can log in on the Internet.	1
ClaimBuster	17585	And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.	0
ClaimBuster	17586	It's really -- it's really very interesting.	0
ClaimBuster	17587	They're willing to work with us.	1
ClaimBuster	17588	if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it's because the Federal Government has pre-empted.	0
ClaimBuster	17589	I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has.	0
ClaimBuster	17590	We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	17591	So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	17592	I'll be glad to take a shot at it.	0
ClaimBuster	17593	It's been very strong since I've been president.	0
ClaimBuster	17594	But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is.	0
ClaimBuster	17595	I think these assault weapons are a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	17596	And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.	1
ClaimBuster	17597	I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future.	1
ClaimBuster	17598	That's what's at stake in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	17599	There was hatred, there was divisiveness - uh people had lost faith in their government in many, many respects.	0
ClaimBuster	17600	But I'm not going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	17601	"And he said, ""Yes, I think that's fair."""	1
ClaimBuster	17602	We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.	0
ClaimBuster	17603	All of which was opposed by my opponent.	1
ClaimBuster	17604	And it's blocked by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	17605	Well, the matter of judgment is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	17606	If that isn't a liberal idea, I've never heard one.	0
ClaimBuster	17607	I'm glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience.	0
ClaimBuster	17608	We need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president, the leader of his country, to seek out every possible way to get that information which has kept the MIA families in despair and doubt, and Mr. Ford has just not done it.	1
ClaimBuster	17609	They do not pay us.	1
ClaimBuster	17610	But let's look at the other side of the coin.	0
ClaimBuster	17611	And you talk about cutting benefits.	1
ClaimBuster	17612	When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.	0
ClaimBuster	17613	That creates about 4 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	17614	And we've got to do several things at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	17615	We've got to pay it off and build money to renew it- -spend money to renew it, and that's going to take a growing, expanding job base.	0
ClaimBuster	17616	America's going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure.	0
ClaimBuster	17617	More land being restored since I've been the president.	1
ClaimBuster	17618	And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.	0
ClaimBuster	17619	I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.	1
ClaimBuster	17620	I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	17621	And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.	1
ClaimBuster	17622	Over 150,000 Americans have died of AIDS.	1
ClaimBuster	17623	It's only on yellow here.	1
ClaimBuster	17624	I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the revolution.	0
ClaimBuster	17625	That's exactly the philosophy that we've seen in place for the last decade.	1
ClaimBuster	17626	With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	17627	Do you want to go first?	0
ClaimBuster	17628	I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	17629	And so when you're running up the taxes like that, you're taxing job creators, and that's not how you keep jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	17630	We have increased funding for AIDS.	1
ClaimBuster	17631	I want to change it.	0
ClaimBuster	17632	I want to lead a unified country.	0
ClaimBuster	17633	He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	17634	Tonight you√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢re going to hear that my passion and my vision is to empower Americans to be able to make decisions for themselves in their own lives.	0
ClaimBuster	17635	Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we can't do.	0
ClaimBuster	17636	They put a plan out.	0
ClaimBuster	17637	I will not cut the benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	17638	This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	17639	Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me.	0
ClaimBuster	17640	We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.	0
ClaimBuster	17641	Latin America is a huge opportunity for us -- time zone, language opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	17642	Look at the record of the man running for the president.	0
ClaimBuster	17643	Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.	1
ClaimBuster	17644	(Laughter, boos) That's my five seconds.	0
ClaimBuster	17645	I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	17646	I want to invest in our children.	0
ClaimBuster	17647	What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesn't have different ideas.	0
ClaimBuster	17648	Look at our surgeon general, Dr. Novello.	0
ClaimBuster	17649	But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.	1
ClaimBuster	17650	That's one that I haven't...	0
ClaimBuster	17651	I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	17652	We should have -- wait one second.	0
ClaimBuster	17653	I was hoping diplomacy would work.	0
ClaimBuster	17654	We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.	1
ClaimBuster	17655	And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.	0
ClaimBuster	17656	They said, let us win.	1
ClaimBuster	17657	It's not, and let me explain the difference.	0
ClaimBuster	17658	No, Bob, regrettably, we have not moved far enough along.	0
ClaimBuster	17659	The world is safer without Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	17660	And now that the energy prices are high, I guess he's not advocating those big energy taxes right now.	1
ClaimBuster	17661	I think the American people should be the judge of that.	0
ClaimBuster	17662	And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.	0
ClaimBuster	17663	We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.	1
ClaimBuster	17664	I have great respect for women.	0
ClaimBuster	17665	I believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power.	0
ClaimBuster	17666	The laws regarding that always were State laws.	1
ClaimBuster	17667	This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of --	0
ClaimBuster	17668	They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	17669	I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	17670	I think it's the attitude.	0
ClaimBuster	17671	It's an important priority, because now is the time to act and we're going to say to our seniors, our promises we've made to you will be promises kept.	0
ClaimBuster	17672	And I made some tough decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	17673	You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	17674	We got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and they got to be right once.	0
ClaimBuster	17675	A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he's promised.	0
ClaimBuster	17676	But we didn't need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	17677	I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.	1
ClaimBuster	17678	There is something else about Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	17679	Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	17680	But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	17681	And what's happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America's young people.	0
ClaimBuster	17682	They spend too much money on themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	17683	Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	17684	I won't ask you, but if you do, you're in the top 1%.	0
ClaimBuster	17685	This is the administration that fought regulatory reform that is putting a lot of small businessmen and small businesswomen out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	17686	Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.	1
ClaimBuster	17687	Well, I don't think I ran the ad.	0
ClaimBuster	17688	I uh - said that I've served this country for fourteen years.	1
ClaimBuster	17689	So from your business, helping in buying a first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about.	0
ClaimBuster	17690	But it's not good enough.	0
ClaimBuster	17691	It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans.	0
ClaimBuster	17692	We've got to do something about it.	0
ClaimBuster	17693	Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.	0
ClaimBuster	17694	We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.	1
ClaimBuster	17695	We just have a different point of view.	0
ClaimBuster	17696	I have spent the last quarter century fighting for middle-class working men and women in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	17697	And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	17698	That's why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago.	1
ClaimBuster	17699	I prepared to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	17700	Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal.	0
ClaimBuster	17701	We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.	0
ClaimBuster	17702	In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	17703	It's like a huge tax gap.	0
ClaimBuster	17704	But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period.	0
ClaimBuster	17705	But what does he offer?	0
ClaimBuster	17706	He hasn't had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days.	1
ClaimBuster	17707	That's a whole other subject, but I see we still have a little bit more time.	0
ClaimBuster	17708	And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income.	1
ClaimBuster	17709	This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.	0
ClaimBuster	17710	Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it's accurate to say that there is no uh - prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh - Yugoslavia should uh - Mr. Tito pass away.	1
ClaimBuster	17711	That is not how we grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	17712	I think what I'd like to talk about a minute, since you're asking the question, is the General Motors issue.	0
ClaimBuster	17713	And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.	0
ClaimBuster	17714	Take a look at Libya.	0
ClaimBuster	17715	It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.	1
ClaimBuster	17716	It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before.	1
ClaimBuster	17717	I think of a young man now in this country named Villadaris, who was released from a Cuban jail.	1
ClaimBuster	17718	Now, as to my closing remarks: I've always believed that this land was placed here between the two great oceans by some divine plan.	0
ClaimBuster	17719	Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war.	1
ClaimBuster	17720	The ones that are out there are doing well.	0
ClaimBuster	17721	And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.	0
ClaimBuster	17722	We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.	0
ClaimBuster	17723	And what I'm looking for is who did it?	0
ClaimBuster	17724	They're going to do a tremendous job.	0
ClaimBuster	17725	I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.	0
ClaimBuster	17726	And I think we're both very lucky.	0
ClaimBuster	17727	We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.	0
ClaimBuster	17728	And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	17729	And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B.	0
ClaimBuster	17730	They left the planning of the State Department in the State Department desks.	1
ClaimBuster	17731	And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission.	1
ClaimBuster	17732	But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be.	0
ClaimBuster	17733	Today you've got problems in Europe, still bubbling along even though Europe's gone democracy's route.	0
ClaimBuster	17734	And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.	1
ClaimBuster	17735	But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.	0
ClaimBuster	17736	Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say I'll never get sick, therefore I don't need health care right now.	0
ClaimBuster	17737	We've got to collect the taxes to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	17738	We also raised the amount of each Pell Grant.	1
ClaimBuster	17739	And the answer is to discipline both the executive branch and the congressional branch by holding the line on taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	17740	This we must get across to the world.	0
ClaimBuster	17741	And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	17742	We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem.	0
ClaimBuster	17743	And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.	1
ClaimBuster	17744	We're going to give a better prescription program.	0
ClaimBuster	17745	Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be.	0
ClaimBuster	17746	And here is where my opponent and I differ.	0
ClaimBuster	17747	But there are opportunities there now.	0
ClaimBuster	17748	We worked very closely with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs.	1
ClaimBuster	17749	Senator Obama talks about the budgets I voted for.	1
ClaimBuster	17750	Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years.	1
ClaimBuster	17751	There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.	0
ClaimBuster	17752	I talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding Saddam Hussein accountable.	1
ClaimBuster	17753	You can look at me.	0
ClaimBuster	17754	Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	17755	And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based.	0
ClaimBuster	17756	There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	17757	And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary.	1
ClaimBuster	17758	He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.	0
ClaimBuster	17759	I can't say it any more plainly.	0
ClaimBuster	17760	That saves manpower, and it saves equipment.	0
ClaimBuster	17761	In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.	1
ClaimBuster	17762	And there is a connection.	0
ClaimBuster	17763	All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.	1
ClaimBuster	17764	I can't find a job.	0
ClaimBuster	17765	And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative.	1
ClaimBuster	17766	Uhh - I have recommended to the Congress, however - I'm sure you're familiar with this - legislation that would uhh - make it uhh - very uhh - proper in - in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases.	0
ClaimBuster	17767	I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.	0
ClaimBuster	17768	In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.	0
ClaimBuster	17769	In the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden.	1
ClaimBuster	17770	The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, don't you?	0
ClaimBuster	17771	We can't put the Middle East peace process on our timetable.	0
ClaimBuster	17772	And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	17773	I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it, but that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions.	1
ClaimBuster	17774	We used to be there.	1
ClaimBuster	17775	Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.	0
ClaimBuster	17776	So we have our differences.	0
ClaimBuster	17777	After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.	1
ClaimBuster	17778	That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?	1
ClaimBuster	17779	I'm going to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	17780	There's just no doubt in my mind we would rue the day, had Saddam Hussein been in power.	0
ClaimBuster	17781	And I'll tell you what.	0
ClaimBuster	17782	I think that -- well, I think that's part of the need for a cultural change.	0
ClaimBuster	17783	But maybe you meant that some in the country don't have the will to fight it, but those that are out there on the front line, as you know -- you've been a strong backer of law enforcement -- really -- I just want to clear that up --have the will to fight it, and, frankly, some of them are giving their lives.	1
ClaimBuster	17784	He's parsing words, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	17785	And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	17786	And everybody says they take responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	17787	It doesn't work that way.	0
ClaimBuster	17788	I'm spending my money -- not PAC money, not foreign money, my money -- to take this message to the people.	1
ClaimBuster	17789	Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.	1
ClaimBuster	17790	It does involve going after them online.	0
ClaimBuster	17791	And there is a difference principle -	0
ClaimBuster	17792	What's relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and I'd like it for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	17793	Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh - who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, they'll be persuaded to follow our example.	0
ClaimBuster	17794	We have to restore trust between communities and the police.	0
ClaimBuster	17795	This is a big question.	0
ClaimBuster	17796	The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again.	1
ClaimBuster	17797	But we're opening the Old Post Office.	1
ClaimBuster	17798	And change for change sake isn't enough.	0
ClaimBuster	17799	So we've got to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	17800	Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.	1
ClaimBuster	17801	I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.	0
ClaimBuster	17802	So their economy is in a shambles.	1
ClaimBuster	17803	That happened on this president's watch.	1
ClaimBuster	17804	Make sure your kids can go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	17805	But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	17806	I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.	0
ClaimBuster	17807	So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.	0
ClaimBuster	17808	Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	17809	If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.	0
ClaimBuster	17810	Do not go to the extreme.	0
ClaimBuster	17811	You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.	0
ClaimBuster	17812	And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.	0
ClaimBuster	17813	The programs that we've been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don't work.	0
ClaimBuster	17814	Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala.	0
ClaimBuster	17815	We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	17816	Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.	1
ClaimBuster	17817	We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient.	0
ClaimBuster	17818	I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives.	1
ClaimBuster	17819	Now, whose fault is that?	0
ClaimBuster	17820	It works when we make sure they've got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	17821	Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	17822	This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17823	Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.	1
ClaimBuster	17824	There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	17825	of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason.	0
ClaimBuster	17826	It's all happening in this administration because they cut funding and they cut interdiction.	1
ClaimBuster	17827	In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it, and that's fine, but we're going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees.	1
ClaimBuster	17828	But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools.	0
ClaimBuster	17829	Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.	1
ClaimBuster	17830	The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	17831	We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan.	0
ClaimBuster	17832	We need to have accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	17833	Because we've got -- we have presided over the largest increase -- we've got to have a new direction for this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17834	So mandatory conservation measures - yes.	0
ClaimBuster	17835	They've been prepared to defend.	1
ClaimBuster	17836	But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if I'm elected president, I'll work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	17837	We've been dormant too long.	0
ClaimBuster	17838	We're doing our duty to provide the funding.	0
ClaimBuster	17839	The president thinks it's more important to fight for that top 1 percent than to fight for fiscal responsibility and to fight for you.	0
ClaimBuster	17840	Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.	1
ClaimBuster	17841	That's the height of silliness...	0
ClaimBuster	17842	But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD -- MAD is mutual assured destruction -- meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we'll kill as many people of yours as you'll kill of ours.	1
ClaimBuster	17843	We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.	1
ClaimBuster	17844	And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't.	1
ClaimBuster	17845	Ladies and gentlemen, the president just didn't level with you right now again.	0
ClaimBuster	17846	Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America.	0
ClaimBuster	17847	That's what the American worker wants.	0
ClaimBuster	17848	And as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more.	0
ClaimBuster	17849	First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.	0
ClaimBuster	17850	And I think what we have to do is convince people there is a big difference, if you vote one way you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century, if you vote the other way, you won't.	0
ClaimBuster	17851	Now, the president has never explained to America, ever, hasn't done it tonight, where does the transitional money, that $2 trillion, come from?	1
ClaimBuster	17852	I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying.	1
ClaimBuster	17853	But I think it's really an important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	17854	We have to do a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	17855	I think it's time to have a truce.	0
ClaimBuster	17856	Now, on the subject of free trade agreements.	0
ClaimBuster	17857	I've supported Headstart, I think we ought to look at it.	1
ClaimBuster	17858	Let's come back to what the president was speaking about, which is what's happening in the world and the president's statement that things are going so well.	0
ClaimBuster	17859	I think we need to have clean coal technologies.	0
ClaimBuster	17860	She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if she'll forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling.	1
ClaimBuster	17861	Well, let me thank everybody here at the University and, Jim, thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	17862	You got two years to look for a job.	1
ClaimBuster	17863	And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	17864	If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	17865	But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.	0
ClaimBuster	17866	James Lee Witt of FEMA has done a really good job of working with governors during times of crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	17867	If I were dealing with politics here, the polls show the American people want this.	0
ClaimBuster	17868	And I'm not going to run up taxes, which will cost this economy jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	17869	The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West.	1
ClaimBuster	17870	And I'm frankly surprised you didn't pay more attention to that example.	0
ClaimBuster	17871	No, of course I haven't talked to Prime Minister Macmillan.	1
ClaimBuster	17872	We've got to put more money into preventive care.	0
ClaimBuster	17873	I said, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed with me, that it was time for us to turn our research ability to seeing if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon.	1
ClaimBuster	17874	If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.	0
ClaimBuster	17875	A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	17876	Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides.	0
ClaimBuster	17877	That's not the way we cut -- we'll cut out all the pork.	0
ClaimBuster	17878	Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and I'm pleased to have his support.	0
ClaimBuster	17879	And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.	0
ClaimBuster	17880	We have to help people succeed at home and at work.	0
ClaimBuster	17881	That's why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but it's got to be paid for.	0
ClaimBuster	17882	I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.	0
ClaimBuster	17883	Right now we have a flat to deteriorating job base and where it appears to be growing, it's minimum-wage jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	17884	But I'd say, if you had to separate out, I think it's experience at this level.	0
ClaimBuster	17885	You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you.	0
ClaimBuster	17886	And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit.	0
ClaimBuster	17887	Now, I'm going to tell you what I really think is going to happen over time is technology is going to change the way we live for the good for the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	17888	But he wasn't in the Senate with Senator Feingold.	1
ClaimBuster	17889	We have to be able to compete in the world market.	0
ClaimBuster	17890	It's -- you've got to be consistent when you're the president.	0
ClaimBuster	17891	Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.	0
ClaimBuster	17892	That has been where all our resources have gone.	1
ClaimBuster	17893	And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that.	0
ClaimBuster	17894	And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	17895	I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	17896	We are a rising nation.	1
ClaimBuster	17897	Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government - our government - to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights?	0
ClaimBuster	17898	But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good.	0
ClaimBuster	17899	And sometimes you can't go it alone.	0
ClaimBuster	17900	And I got a long history of doing that.	1
ClaimBuster	17901	He would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.	0
ClaimBuster	17902	There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol.	1
ClaimBuster	17903	That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.	0
ClaimBuster	17904	I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington.	1
ClaimBuster	17905	I want to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	17906	This would not be done just on the first day.	0
ClaimBuster	17907	Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future.	0
ClaimBuster	17908	Then the other day he says he's for it, however then we've got to pass other legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	17909	I have a realistic approach to trade.	0
ClaimBuster	17910	We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	17911	Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh - Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government.	1
ClaimBuster	17912	Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct.	1
ClaimBuster	17913	The world is better off without Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	17914	When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision.	0
ClaimBuster	17915	I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.	1
ClaimBuster	17916	I've already put forward things that'll get this country working fast, some of which have been echoed here tonight--investment tax allowance, capital gains reduction, more on research and development, tax credit for first-time home buyers.	0
ClaimBuster	17917	Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because it's an example of the overall approach that I think is important.	0
ClaimBuster	17918	He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.	1
ClaimBuster	17919	Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.	0
ClaimBuster	17920	First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible.	0
ClaimBuster	17921	But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history.	1
ClaimBuster	17922	If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	17923	Let me take just a minute to comment on something that Governor Carter said.	0
ClaimBuster	17924	So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.	0
ClaimBuster	17925	1 percent of Americans is the highest it's been since 1928.	1
ClaimBuster	17926	It would cost something like a trillion dollars to test and deploy weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	17927	Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.	1
ClaimBuster	17928	This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	17929	And I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.	0
ClaimBuster	17930	When you get on an airplane, your bag is X- rayed, but the cargo hold isn't X-rayed.	1
ClaimBuster	17931	I think we have to make the right and responsible choices.	0
ClaimBuster	17932	One of the good things we've gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you can't cure unless you know.	0
ClaimBuster	17933	You said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	17934	That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation.	1
ClaimBuster	17935	I'm going to bring them together.	0
ClaimBuster	17936	How stupid is our country?	0
ClaimBuster	17937	But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	17938	That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.	0
ClaimBuster	17939	That's the way the game's played now.	0
ClaimBuster	17940	But if you're a president, it's not.	0
ClaimBuster	17941	And anybody who thinks I'm just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	17942	So we have to do two things, as I said.	0
ClaimBuster	17943	As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.	1
ClaimBuster	17944	Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.	0
ClaimBuster	17945	She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.	0
ClaimBuster	17946	So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way.	0
ClaimBuster	17947	We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.	0
ClaimBuster	17948	He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.	1
ClaimBuster	17949	I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests.	0
ClaimBuster	17950	This is a very important topic and it's a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue.	1
ClaimBuster	17951	...the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life?	0
ClaimBuster	17952	I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.	0
ClaimBuster	17953	I'd like to understand who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence, thousands of guns going to Mexican drug lords.	1
ClaimBuster	17954	That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	17955	More soldiers killed in June than before.	1
ClaimBuster	17956	I selected him because of his outstanding record as a Circuit Court of Appeals Judge, and I was very pleased that uh - an overwhelming Democratic United States Senate, after going into his background, came to the conclusion that he was uh - fit and should serve, and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming.	0
ClaimBuster	17957	So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.	0
ClaimBuster	17958	I don't care if the idea comes from the other side or this side.	0
ClaimBuster	17959	And we are doing a better job of it.	0
ClaimBuster	17960	For 31/2 years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	17961	They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back.	0
ClaimBuster	17962	Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse.	0
ClaimBuster	17963	And, of course, Iraq is a central part in the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	17964	Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say there's a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust.	0
ClaimBuster	17965	I will not agree to any production restrictions -- or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements.	0
ClaimBuster	17966	Can I comment on that?	0
ClaimBuster	17967	It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.	0
ClaimBuster	17968	The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.	0
ClaimBuster	17969	And I'm going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	17970	He said that he was the second most powerful man in Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	17971	Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children.	0
ClaimBuster	17972	But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	17973	But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed.	0
ClaimBuster	17974	All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	17975	Well, we've had this discussion before.	1
ClaimBuster	17976	'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now.	0
ClaimBuster	17977	And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	17978	Let's give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.	0
ClaimBuster	17979	We have seen him insult women.	1
ClaimBuster	17980	But I've made a different bet on American workers.	0
ClaimBuster	17981	We're going to do that with an economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	17982	90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	17983	So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we're going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I'll sign the bill.	1
ClaimBuster	17984	I do not think that they are.	0
ClaimBuster	17985	To the best of my knowledge he's never once suggested that a session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of Allegiance.	1
ClaimBuster	17986	"O'Neill said, ""Come on over."	1
ClaimBuster	17987	That is priority one in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	17988	The sanctions are being violated.	1
ClaimBuster	17989	The freeze people were wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	17990	The -- the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher.	1
ClaimBuster	17991	We spent $300 billion a year defending the world.	1
ClaimBuster	17992	I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs.	0
ClaimBuster	17993	Let me just give you some examples.	0
ClaimBuster	17994	It wasn't created as a welfare program.	1
ClaimBuster	17995	So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.	0
ClaimBuster	17996	If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.	0
ClaimBuster	17997	We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally.	1
ClaimBuster	17998	I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.	0
ClaimBuster	17999	Let me just make this comment.	0
ClaimBuster	18000	We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	18001	I told the NRA that's history.	1
ClaimBuster	18002	There are some programs that are very important that are under funded.	0
ClaimBuster	18003	The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.	1
ClaimBuster	18004	Well, we are the ones who found those.	0
ClaimBuster	18005	In 1983, as a result of these tax preferences, he paid a little over 12 percent, 12.8 percent in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	18006	I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	18007	In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	18008	Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.	1
ClaimBuster	18009	I don't know the answer to when life begins.	0
ClaimBuster	18010	And I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income.	0
ClaimBuster	18011	Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.	0
ClaimBuster	18012	I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.	0
ClaimBuster	18013	This is a serious business.	0
ClaimBuster	18014	This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal.	0
ClaimBuster	18015	It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank, and I believe if the parties will get together and in a good-faith manner make that agreement, that they'll be able to do it if we cannot impose a peace on the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	18016	When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.	0
ClaimBuster	18017	I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage.	0
ClaimBuster	18018	My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.	0
ClaimBuster	18019	But I tell you, those workers don't feel that way.	0
ClaimBuster	18020	And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.	0
ClaimBuster	18021	I fully understand the threat.	0
ClaimBuster	18022	But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	18023	You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.	0
ClaimBuster	18024	That's why we have to continue to be alert.	0
ClaimBuster	18025	People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.	0
ClaimBuster	18026	I ask you for your help.	0
ClaimBuster	18027	And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.	0
ClaimBuster	18028	And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	18029	If I had to solve all the problems that face this country and I could be granted one wish as we started down the trail to rebuild the job base, the schools and so on and so forth, I would say a strong family unit in every home, where every child is loved, nurtured, and encouraged.	0
ClaimBuster	18030	I'll tell you exactly what I think can be done.	0
ClaimBuster	18031	On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday - for our great country.	1
ClaimBuster	18032	These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.	0
ClaimBuster	18033	When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don't make a difference.	1
ClaimBuster	18034	Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18035	And it's time for them to get serious on it.	0
ClaimBuster	18036	And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	18037	We√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ll deal with our problems, we√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢ll solve our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	18038	Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.	1
ClaimBuster	18039	And I'm a big proponent.	0
ClaimBuster	18040	It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations.	0
ClaimBuster	18041	He voted 98 times to raise taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	18042	And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	18043	I think you've apologized for it.	1
ClaimBuster	18044	Medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with fewer benefits, the kinds of things we've had under this Administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	18045	We shouldn't discriminate -- race, color, whatever -- life-style, disability.	0
ClaimBuster	18046	They went to Austin High School.	1
ClaimBuster	18047	Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound.	0
ClaimBuster	18048	So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.	1
ClaimBuster	18049	So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.	1
ClaimBuster	18050	Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.	0
ClaimBuster	18051	Look, we must improve education in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18052	We have a government that doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	18053	But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that's what my plan does.	1
ClaimBuster	18054	But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street.	1
ClaimBuster	18055	It's time to do it because we have run up so much debt that time is no longer our friend.	0
ClaimBuster	18056	They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another.	0
ClaimBuster	18057	You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.	1
ClaimBuster	18058	I'm not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	18059	If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.	0
ClaimBuster	18060	We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	18061	I might say to Mr. Perot, I can understand why you might have missed it, because there's so much fascination with trivia, but I worked out a deal with Boris Yeltsin to eliminate, get rid of entirely, the most destabilizing weapons of all, the SS-18, the intercontinental ballistic missile.	1
ClaimBuster	18062	By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution.	0
ClaimBuster	18063	And so we just have an honest difference of opinion: I support it and he doesn't.	1
ClaimBuster	18064	H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.	0
ClaimBuster	18065	I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?	0
ClaimBuster	18066	The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice president's expenditures.	1
ClaimBuster	18067	I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps.	0
ClaimBuster	18068	Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again.	1
ClaimBuster	18069	If all of the unemployed today were in a single line allowing two feet for each of them, that line would reach from New York City to Los Angeles, California.	1
ClaimBuster	18070	But he, like welfare reform, I'm going to sign it but I'm going to try to change it next year.	0
ClaimBuster	18071	I think it's important and I share it.	0
ClaimBuster	18072	This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies.	0
ClaimBuster	18073	We need to encourage business.	0
ClaimBuster	18074	And that's because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	18075	And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	18076	And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.	1
ClaimBuster	18077	Just want to make sure they're safe.	0
ClaimBuster	18078	In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didn't get any relief the first time around.	1
ClaimBuster	18079	See, we've got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less.	1
ClaimBuster	18080	That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	18081	But I believe that's not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesn't matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years.	1
ClaimBuster	18082	And we've got a choice.	0
ClaimBuster	18083	Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind.	0
ClaimBuster	18084	There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	18085	Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order...	1
ClaimBuster	18086	And I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago.	1
ClaimBuster	18087	As I said, I've worked all my life when I was in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	18088	We've been caught up in a global slowdown.	0
ClaimBuster	18089	But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	18090	I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes.	1
ClaimBuster	18091	We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.	1
ClaimBuster	18092	I know you do it.	0
ClaimBuster	18093	When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying we don't want to abandon the peace process.	1
ClaimBuster	18094	That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you.	0
ClaimBuster	18095	One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, that says the government has got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice.	0
ClaimBuster	18096	Can I say, if I could just say a word about a woman that you didn't ask about, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, just before I was deciding to run.	1
ClaimBuster	18097	I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.	0
ClaimBuster	18098	I'm very proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	18099	There are fewer parents of school-age children as a percentage of the voting population and there is the largest generation of students ever.	1
ClaimBuster	18100	Some people don't like the fact that I stood up to say no, but I did.	0
ClaimBuster	18101	First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	18102	Let me give you one quick example.	0
ClaimBuster	18103	I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home.	0
ClaimBuster	18104	And we're not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours.	0
ClaimBuster	18105	Trying to frighten people in the voting booth.	0
ClaimBuster	18106	Over the last 10 years we've created manufacturing jobs much more rapidly than the national average.	1
ClaimBuster	18107	Senator Obama said that would be provocative.	1
ClaimBuster	18108	I wouldn't have taken any of the alternatives.	0
ClaimBuster	18109	I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.	0
ClaimBuster	18110	And we need to make it stronger.	0
ClaimBuster	18111	Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.	0
ClaimBuster	18112	I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident.	0
ClaimBuster	18113	All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	18114	I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns.	0
ClaimBuster	18115	I don't break my promises after the election, and I don't make new promises in an election year.	0
ClaimBuster	18116	But what we don't need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas.	0
ClaimBuster	18117	Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset.	1
ClaimBuster	18118	You've got another life involved.	0
ClaimBuster	18119	Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.	0
ClaimBuster	18120	What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone.	0
ClaimBuster	18121	I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	18122	Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	18123	It's something you might consider.	0
ClaimBuster	18124	And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	18125	And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.	1
ClaimBuster	18126	We need to do better in education.	0
ClaimBuster	18127	We have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it and we've got to improve the quality for those who do with a patient's bill of rights that's real and that works, the Dingle-Norwood bill, and we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness, because that's been left out.	0
ClaimBuster	18128	And you cannot change positions in this war on terror if you expect to win.	0
ClaimBuster	18129	It says to American working men and women that are thrown out of work for no fault of their own that they're going to have jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	18130	So Senator Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	18131	You talk about mixed messages.	0
ClaimBuster	18132	But then when he moved against Kuwait, I said this will not stand.	1
ClaimBuster	18133	As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.	0
ClaimBuster	18134	I left public life on June the 11th of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	18135	I didn't say I would bring troops out in six months.	1
ClaimBuster	18136	Now, let's go back to Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	18137	That's why we need campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	18138	We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children.	0
ClaimBuster	18139	My opponent says he has a plan; it sounds familiar, because it's called the Bush plan.	0
ClaimBuster	18140	I look on this as history.	0
ClaimBuster	18141	You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.	1
ClaimBuster	18142	These next 2 weeks we will be going full steam ahead to make sure that you get a voice and that you get your country back.	0
ClaimBuster	18143	Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict.	1
ClaimBuster	18144	And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn't understand, it's got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	18145	So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.	1
ClaimBuster	18146	Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table?	0
ClaimBuster	18147	We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition.	1
ClaimBuster	18148	He's talking about his plan to keep jobs here.	1
ClaimBuster	18149	I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	18150	So I do think we need to strengthen family.	0
ClaimBuster	18151	I've reached across the aisle.	1
ClaimBuster	18152	But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that aren't and eliminate them and we'll have to scrub every agency of government.	0
ClaimBuster	18153	It seems to me the president, whoever the president may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities.	0
ClaimBuster	18154	I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists.	0
ClaimBuster	18155	And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	18156	You have to see it to believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	18157	I served on the Small Business Committee for a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	18158	The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	18159	Homeownership rate is at an all-time high in America.	1
ClaimBuster	18160	And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.	0
ClaimBuster	18161	The report was so bad.	0
ClaimBuster	18162	Zero, because as I said in our last debate and I'll repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.	1
ClaimBuster	18163	We don't know who the rebels are.	1
ClaimBuster	18164	He suggested that we aid distressed areas.	1
ClaimBuster	18165	Now, maybe that explains why he hasn't fully funded the VA and the VA hospital is having trouble and veterans are complaining.	0
ClaimBuster	18166	-- because we're going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	18167	It's a state tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	18168	Well, we have Great Britain.	1
ClaimBuster	18169	We can't get anything done.	0
ClaimBuster	18170	He's a strong, courageous leader.	0
ClaimBuster	18171	I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness.	0
ClaimBuster	18172	I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.	0
ClaimBuster	18173	I get a 10-point spot.	0
ClaimBuster	18174	I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be.	0
ClaimBuster	18175	Let's get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	18176	One thing I've called for that has been stymied, and I'll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	18177	It's time for our nation to come together and do what's right for the people, and I think this is right for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	18178	There's too much bitterness in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	18179	But we're not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars.	0
ClaimBuster	18180	We've seen uh - in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh - section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh - Small Business Administration lend uh - a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	18181	Now, if you don't want to really do that I'm not your man.	0
ClaimBuster	18182	It would save a lot of money through more managed care, by giving more options, more preventative care and lowering the inflation rate and the prices we're paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and out-of-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide.	0
ClaimBuster	18183	They see 900 FBI files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the Whitehouse.	1
ClaimBuster	18184	I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.	1
ClaimBuster	18185	But I've not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	18186	We are being murdered economically because we have too many drop-outs, we have too many low birthweight babies, we have too many drug addicts as kids, we have too much violence, we are too divided by race, by income, by region.	0
ClaimBuster	18187	And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	18188	We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.	0
ClaimBuster	18189	I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev's uh - performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower's eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high.	0
ClaimBuster	18190	Getting us to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	18191	They went to extraordinary sick lengths, and I just found it amusing that they would take 2 or 3 cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator -- the lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common.	1
ClaimBuster	18192	In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage.	1
ClaimBuster	18193	If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence.	0
ClaimBuster	18194	It's going to be a little tougher because we're talking about very complex and difficult issues.	0
ClaimBuster	18195	You tell Tony Blair we're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	18196	Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education.	0
ClaimBuster	18197	"I'm not that concerned. """	0
ClaimBuster	18198	Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.	1
ClaimBuster	18199	One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line.	0
ClaimBuster	18200	Wasn't this the George Bush that supported Mr. Meese?	0
ClaimBuster	18201	I never go anywhere, it seems like, where I don't meet somebody who has benefited from a Family Leave Law.	1
ClaimBuster	18202	They didn't have the weapons, they didn't have the tanks.	1
ClaimBuster	18203	We've had great success in my own state.	1
ClaimBuster	18204	It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	18205	And to suggest that the SALT II treaty that your negotiators negotiated was just a continuation, and based on all of the preceding efforts by two previous Presidents, is just not true.	0
ClaimBuster	18206	The president's spending, the president's borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	18207	You're stuck in a time warp in many ways.	0
ClaimBuster	18208	It simply says all these states -- it made it illegal for kids to smoke.	0
ClaimBuster	18209	Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all.	0
ClaimBuster	18210	We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.	0
ClaimBuster	18211	And the take-home pay of the richest .	0
ClaimBuster	18212	They just skim off $15 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	18213	Well, you know, nailing down Senator Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall.	0
ClaimBuster	18214	Uh - there was one example, for instance, where uh - somebody uh - produced pornographic movies.	0
ClaimBuster	18215	So we've got to really rebuild our job base.	0
ClaimBuster	18216	Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.	0
ClaimBuster	18217	But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our -- of our troops.	0
ClaimBuster	18218	I'm not reconsidering my position.	0
ClaimBuster	18219	I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	18220	And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.	0
ClaimBuster	18221	There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter.	1
ClaimBuster	18222	I mean, I've told people as I've traveled around, all of you that got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in '96 and not many hands go up.	0
ClaimBuster	18223	And the bottom line is that the United States left in humiliation, and our enemies are stronger.	1
ClaimBuster	18224	We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again.	0
ClaimBuster	18225	... and the rest of the answer, way off the mark.	0
ClaimBuster	18226	Of course they care about them.	0
ClaimBuster	18227	And that is why we are maintaining a deterrent and trying to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage.	0
ClaimBuster	18228	"If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, ""Sorry, we don't have the votes,"" I'd have said, ""Then we're going to have a fight. """	0
ClaimBuster	18229	If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	18230	You say that you're going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions, without naming what those loopholes and deductions are.	0
ClaimBuster	18231	And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years.	0
ClaimBuster	18232	We had the worst economy in a century.	1
ClaimBuster	18233	They like it because it doesn't accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the HMO or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to, and it has strong bipartisan support.	1
ClaimBuster	18234	We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.	0
ClaimBuster	18235	And I'm interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years.	0
ClaimBuster	18236	So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.	1
ClaimBuster	18237	I don't believe that's a fair measure.	0
ClaimBuster	18238	All these other countries are looking to us.	0
ClaimBuster	18239	So we've seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools.	0
ClaimBuster	18240	Can we take the time --	0
ClaimBuster	18241	We have got to do much more.	0
ClaimBuster	18242	So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked.	0
ClaimBuster	18243	I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	18244	And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.	1
ClaimBuster	18245	The mayor up there, on the program.	0
ClaimBuster	18246	And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	18247	"""And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, ""No, I can't do that. """	1
ClaimBuster	18248	But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically.	0
ClaimBuster	18249	We have seen uh - the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance.	1
ClaimBuster	18250	That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	18251	But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.	0
ClaimBuster	18252	This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years.	1
ClaimBuster	18253	And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a -- in a form of -- if not government, a form of -- of -- of council that can take the lead in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	18254	And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	18255	And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump.	1
ClaimBuster	18256	Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	18257	Let me give you another example of what I mean.	0
ClaimBuster	18258	Uh - very few people knew who I was.	0
ClaimBuster	18259	I agree with the Governor on athletics.	0
ClaimBuster	18260	This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a -- a complete change in the -- the structure and the -- the environment in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	18261	I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program.	1
ClaimBuster	18262	I'm not sure that -- and I can understand if you haven't seen this, because there's been a lot of hue and cry.	0
ClaimBuster	18263	I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	18264	You can't be a superpower unless you're an economic superpower.	0
ClaimBuster	18265	One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam Hussein√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.	0
ClaimBuster	18266	I talked about the principles and the issues that I think are important in a patient's bill of rights.	1
ClaimBuster	18267	But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, we're never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18268	So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one.	1
ClaimBuster	18269	Number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to six months.	0
ClaimBuster	18270	What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	18271	I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles.	1
ClaimBuster	18272	These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.	0
ClaimBuster	18273	I'm gonna make those decisions, and I won't raise taxes on the middle class to pay for my programs.	0
ClaimBuster	18274	But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and I've just defined them.	0
ClaimBuster	18275	We've got to innovate through this America 2000 program.	0
ClaimBuster	18276	I'll tell you this, I want to do something about this.	0
ClaimBuster	18277	Well, first place, I'd like to clear up something because every 4 years, the Democrats go around and say, Republicans are going to cut Social Security and Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	18278	Not in an election year, sir.	0
ClaimBuster	18279	I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.	0
ClaimBuster	18280	I left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something.	1
ClaimBuster	18281	Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D.C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you.	0
ClaimBuster	18282	I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.	0
ClaimBuster	18283	We -- we have, with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups.	1
ClaimBuster	18284	I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	18285	Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	18286	I still believe it was the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	18287	But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea.	0
ClaimBuster	18288	And no one has approached it from that matter.	0
ClaimBuster	18289	If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade - as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 - the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	18290	I hear it -- I hear it echoed by political opponents.	0
ClaimBuster	18291	How's it going to affect my job?	0
ClaimBuster	18292	And if you can't get there, just recognize we're all stuck with one another because nobody's going anywhere, right?	0
ClaimBuster	18293	There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye.	0
ClaimBuster	18294	Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.	0
ClaimBuster	18295	Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.	1
ClaimBuster	18296	And that's his record, and that's a matter of his record.	0
ClaimBuster	18297	But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.	1
ClaimBuster	18298	General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom.	1
ClaimBuster	18299	So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you.	0
ClaimBuster	18300	And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.	0
ClaimBuster	18301	I don't think we need to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	18302	I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	18303	Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	18304	Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?''	0
ClaimBuster	18305	First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	18306	I believe that a lot of people are skeptical about people in politics today because we have seen a time of great challenge for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	18307	So we won't make them famous.	0
ClaimBuster	18308	People are going to pour into our country.	0
ClaimBuster	18309	And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.	1
ClaimBuster	18310	I think that's wrong, and I think we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	18311	I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.	0
ClaimBuster	18312	Whether or not it's -- the same in domestic policy as well.	0
ClaimBuster	18313	But the Federal Government doesn't make money.	1
ClaimBuster	18314	So my argument is not with Ross Perot; it is more with Governor Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	18315	Health care, schools--one on the debt and deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	18316	We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.	0
ClaimBuster	18317	Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it?	0
ClaimBuster	18318	And to move this country forward and we're better off than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	18319	Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.	1
ClaimBuster	18320	You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the -- of three branches there.	1
ClaimBuster	18321	Those schools belong to you.	0
ClaimBuster	18322	Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.	1
ClaimBuster	18323	We ought to love one another because united teams win and divided teams lose.	0
ClaimBuster	18324	... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	18325	I would consider anyone in their qualifications.	0
ClaimBuster	18326	I want to see growing peace in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18327	The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world's opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times.	1
ClaimBuster	18328	I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	18329	It's not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.	1
ClaimBuster	18330	I did a lot of work on this.	1
ClaimBuster	18331	That's kind of pathetic I have to do it -- and nobody's called me yet to come up, I might mention.	1
ClaimBuster	18332	If there's anything that's going to change America it's get the economy growing.	0
ClaimBuster	18333	We are a country of laws.	1
ClaimBuster	18334	Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.	0
ClaimBuster	18335	Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	18336	Well, I'm pleased with the results of the election.	0
ClaimBuster	18337	And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.	1
ClaimBuster	18338	Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan?	0
ClaimBuster	18339	But we always have to stand up for democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	18340	"And when the President was asked the other day, ""What do you want to cut in the budget?"	0
ClaimBuster	18341	It will work, and when it does work, Mr. President, I know you'll congratulate me.	0
ClaimBuster	18342	I'll get him no matter what and I know how to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	18343	So, we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down.	0
ClaimBuster	18344	The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh - be clean.	0
ClaimBuster	18345	And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.	0
ClaimBuster	18346	We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	18347	By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want.	0
ClaimBuster	18348	Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.	0
ClaimBuster	18349	We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation.	0
ClaimBuster	18350	That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President.	1
ClaimBuster	18351	We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are.	0
ClaimBuster	18352	So let me repeat, I do have respect for my opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage.	0
ClaimBuster	18353	But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin it's going to take at least the first year of the new administration.	0
ClaimBuster	18354	I'm asking for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	18355	But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.	1
ClaimBuster	18356	We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.	0
ClaimBuster	18357	So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.	0
ClaimBuster	18358	And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math.	1
ClaimBuster	18359	And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18360	You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.	1
ClaimBuster	18361	And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.	0
ClaimBuster	18362	If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn't want to go back the second day.	0
ClaimBuster	18363	I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson.	1
ClaimBuster	18364	That's why I reach out to the Perot voters.	0
ClaimBuster	18365	Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has.	1
ClaimBuster	18366	And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone -- wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	18367	I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.	0
ClaimBuster	18368	So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions.	0
ClaimBuster	18369	And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.	1
ClaimBuster	18370	We must stand for our ideals.	0
ClaimBuster	18371	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	18372	And what we need now is a president who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this.	0
ClaimBuster	18373	That is absolutely proved over and over again.	0
ClaimBuster	18374	We're now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.	0
ClaimBuster	18375	But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.	0
ClaimBuster	18376	And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.	0
ClaimBuster	18377	First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.	0
ClaimBuster	18378	This used to be a bipartisan issue.	0
ClaimBuster	18379	Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing?	0
ClaimBuster	18380	Ten million citizens have registered to vote.	1
ClaimBuster	18381	Our law enforcement must have every tool necessary to find and disrupt terrorists at home and abroad before they hurt us again.	0
ClaimBuster	18382	So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me.	0
ClaimBuster	18383	And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.	0
ClaimBuster	18384	I'm for the taxpayer bill of rights.	0
ClaimBuster	18385	They have had their chance to get something done.	0
ClaimBuster	18386	I think character is a very important question.	0
ClaimBuster	18387	As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.	0
ClaimBuster	18388	Now, the last point I'd make before...	0
ClaimBuster	18389	Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.	1
ClaimBuster	18390	The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.	0
ClaimBuster	18391	It's a fact they did.	1
ClaimBuster	18392	Of course, it doesn't come out of the payroll tax.	1
ClaimBuster	18393	Do you know what he presented us with?	0
ClaimBuster	18394	The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.	1
ClaimBuster	18395	This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do.	0
ClaimBuster	18396	This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already.	0
ClaimBuster	18397	Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization.	1
ClaimBuster	18398	Nine times I have raised my hand to take an oath to the Constitution, and I have never violated that oath.	1
ClaimBuster	18399	And I accept what the president has said.	0
ClaimBuster	18400	We're down at 1 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18401	We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.	0
ClaimBuster	18402	We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18403	I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.	1
ClaimBuster	18404	Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.	1
ClaimBuster	18405	Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	18406	And I do not believe the government should be making it.	0
ClaimBuster	18407	I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.	0
ClaimBuster	18408	And we have a fundamental choice to make.	0
ClaimBuster	18409	I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and I'm happy to say that I've got a partner that's a good maverick along with me now.	0
ClaimBuster	18410	Is, as Mr. Nixon says, our prestige at an all-time high, as he said a week ago, and that of the Communists at an all-time low?	1
ClaimBuster	18411	The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.	1
ClaimBuster	18412	In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.	1
ClaimBuster	18413	It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate.	0
ClaimBuster	18414	It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.	1
ClaimBuster	18415	But -- and I think the United States can do whatever we reasonably can.	0
ClaimBuster	18416	I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.	1
ClaimBuster	18417	And in my administration, we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border.	0
ClaimBuster	18418	But I hope that from here on you will no longer be saying that particular thing, which is absolutely false.	0
ClaimBuster	18419	But we got to be more aggressive.	0
ClaimBuster	18420	But two years later nobody's lost their handguns.	1
ClaimBuster	18421	But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	18422	We can do better than that.	0
ClaimBuster	18423	Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.	0
ClaimBuster	18424	Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there.	0
ClaimBuster	18425	We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.	0
ClaimBuster	18426	And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation.	0
ClaimBuster	18427	And I think I've had that.	0
ClaimBuster	18428	Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.	1
ClaimBuster	18429	Now I'm the senior Democrat on it.	1
ClaimBuster	18430	They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry.	0
ClaimBuster	18431	Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	18432	I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	18433	I don't think we ought to join that.	0
ClaimBuster	18434	"As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called ""Lincoln."""	1
ClaimBuster	18435	Let me say first, on the President's promise for another tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	18436	We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed.	0
ClaimBuster	18437	We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	18438	But science, there's a lot -- there's differing opinions.	0
ClaimBuster	18439	Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.	1
ClaimBuster	18440	Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.	1
ClaimBuster	18441	And by that I mean we're moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	18442	I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile.	0
ClaimBuster	18443	Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.	1
ClaimBuster	18444	There's been millions and millions of dollars of negative advertising spent distorting my views.	1
ClaimBuster	18445	Well, you know, it's hard to make people love one another.	0
ClaimBuster	18446	But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education.	1
ClaimBuster	18447	While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	18448	And this is what we did.	0
ClaimBuster	18449	What does this mean in real life?	0
ClaimBuster	18450	If we don't, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue.	0
ClaimBuster	18451	The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	18452	What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?	0
ClaimBuster	18453	That's not the right answer for America.	0
ClaimBuster	18454	It's not an opinion; it's a fact.	0
ClaimBuster	18455	You want me to answer a question --	0
ClaimBuster	18456	I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	18457	And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if that's possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state.	0
ClaimBuster	18458	We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.	0
ClaimBuster	18459	We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.	1
ClaimBuster	18460	There are companies that wanted to petition the administration.	0
ClaimBuster	18461	Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.	0
ClaimBuster	18462	You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs.	0
ClaimBuster	18463	I want to be judicious in its use.	0
ClaimBuster	18464	Let me just say the first -- this business about the entitlement he tried to describe about savings, you know, matching savings here and matching savings there, fully-funded it's gonna cost a whole lot of money, a lot more than we have.	0
ClaimBuster	18465	And for two years, this administration didn't talk at all to North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	18466	It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.	0
ClaimBuster	18467	But in any event, no tax.	0
ClaimBuster	18468	That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.	0
ClaimBuster	18469	But I don't confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told - which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards - it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on.	0
ClaimBuster	18470	They want to be free.	1
ClaimBuster	18471	She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank.	1
ClaimBuster	18472	Well, I support our democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	18473	It's nice to -- one on three.	0
ClaimBuster	18474	It's about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	18475	The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.	1
ClaimBuster	18476	That's always been a serious crime and always should be a serious crime.	0
ClaimBuster	18477	He went to Philippines in the early 80√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	18478	At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved.	1
ClaimBuster	18479	Because they are low wage, low skill jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	18480	But this administration doesn't believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military.	0
ClaimBuster	18481	Well, I wondered, when Governor Clinton was talking to the auto workers, whether he talked about his and Senator Gore's favoring CAFE standards, fuel efficiency standards, of 40 miles per gallon.	0
ClaimBuster	18482	In my view, the policy has failed.	0
ClaimBuster	18483	And that drives our friends to the south up into our region, and we need to end those deficits as well.	0
ClaimBuster	18484	And that's what you're faced with, the parents are faced with, and the grand parents are faced with.	0
ClaimBuster	18485	There are many good ones, but I was glad he acknowledged that.	0
ClaimBuster	18486	And what I have to say about this is, many times -- and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative?	1
ClaimBuster	18487	So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18488	And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street.	1
ClaimBuster	18489	Are we building the future that this nation needs?	0
ClaimBuster	18490	I think there's a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	18491	I led for the Earl Wallop bill or formerly Dingell-Johnson.	1
ClaimBuster	18492	Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families.	0
ClaimBuster	18493	So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.	0
ClaimBuster	18494	Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets.	0
ClaimBuster	18495	Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	18496	"But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our nation is greater than what we are now."""	0
ClaimBuster	18497	And by the way, we've also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority.	1
ClaimBuster	18498	Did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough.	1
ClaimBuster	18499	We're going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B-22 airplane.	0
ClaimBuster	18500	People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	18501	The president wants to keep them open.	1
ClaimBuster	18502	They're going to many other countries.	1
ClaimBuster	18503	I don't think it was helpful when he suggested - and I'm glad he's corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	18504	And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.	1
ClaimBuster	18505	That's more than it's had a lot of the time in the last years.	1
ClaimBuster	18506	And America now is paying, already $120 billion, up to $200 billion before we're finished and much more probably.	1
ClaimBuster	18507	I can sometimes take myself too seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	18508	The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states.	0
ClaimBuster	18509	No -- well, what the Vice President must not understand is we've got a hate crimes bill in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	18510	In a discussion of our strategic arms negotiations, I said that submarines carrying missiles and airplanes carrying missiles were more conventional-type weapons, not as destabilizing as the land-based missiles, and that they were also weapons that -- or carriers -- that if they were sent out and there was a change, you could call them back before they had launched their missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	18511	You remember the last time you said that?	0
ClaimBuster	18512	But I will never turn over our national- security decisions to leaders of other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	18513	And that is one of the challenges that America faces.	0
ClaimBuster	18514	I have been for those efforts all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	18515	I will be the president and we will get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	18516	The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.	0
ClaimBuster	18517	I. too, believe in the voluntary military.	0
ClaimBuster	18518	Yes, I'd like to respond very much.	0
ClaimBuster	18519	We dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing.	1
ClaimBuster	18520	Each situation is different, Robin.	0
ClaimBuster	18521	Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.	1
ClaimBuster	18522	They're between 100 and 200% capacity up and down the East Coast.	1
ClaimBuster	18523	We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.	0
ClaimBuster	18524	All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.	0
ClaimBuster	18525	So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.	0
ClaimBuster	18526	New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit.	1
ClaimBuster	18527	You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you won't tolerate gridlock, you won't tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you won't tolerate non-performance.	0
ClaimBuster	18528	It's not the way America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	18529	I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...	0
ClaimBuster	18530	What are freedom's chances in those areas?	0
ClaimBuster	18531	Opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	18532	He lost 1.6 million, ladies and gentlemen.	1
ClaimBuster	18533	Every action being taken against terrorists requires court order, requires scrutiny.	0
ClaimBuster	18534	I think we've got to invest in education and training.	0
ClaimBuster	18535	He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it's down to about 2.4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18536	Older folks, less healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.	0
ClaimBuster	18537	... that's offshore back into the country.	0
ClaimBuster	18538	They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?	0
ClaimBuster	18539	Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring.	0
ClaimBuster	18540	We've climbed the mighty mountain.	0
ClaimBuster	18541	I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those.	0
ClaimBuster	18542	The power of example is America's greatest power in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18543	Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation.	0
ClaimBuster	18544	He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.	1
ClaimBuster	18545	It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.	0
ClaimBuster	18546	I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	18547	It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	18548	They thought they were going to have peace - it brought war.	1
ClaimBuster	18549	I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression.	0
ClaimBuster	18550	I'm for Head Start and moving that up.	0
ClaimBuster	18551	The answer is to invest and grow this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18552	Let me just give you one other example.	0
ClaimBuster	18553	It's very bad, very bad health insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	18554	And he refuses to put anything, controls, on these crazy lawsuits.	1
ClaimBuster	18555	These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job.	0
ClaimBuster	18556	It will go to everybody who pays taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	18557	... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	18558	And people have to decide.	0
ClaimBuster	18559	Your father was right to stand up to Joe McCarthy, you were wrong to attack my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	18560	The Administration tried to do it repeatedly, repeatedly in 81 82.	0
ClaimBuster	18561	So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question.	0
ClaimBuster	18562	Risk your troops in a war you've called a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	18563	That was Senator McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	18564	You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.	1
ClaimBuster	18565	I've had a record of doing so in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	18566	Why are these plants being closed down?	0
ClaimBuster	18567	He wanted first uh - we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted.	1
ClaimBuster	18568	"And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades."	1
ClaimBuster	18569	Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	18570	So the net cost would be 8 billion 6 years from now in a trillion-plus budget -- not very much.	1
ClaimBuster	18571	That is the closest I have ever heard the Governor of Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear, that's about as close as I've ever heard him Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made more safe.	0
ClaimBuster	18572	I think that's the wrong thing.	0
ClaimBuster	18573	The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.	1
ClaimBuster	18574	But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protection is to stay on the offense.	0
ClaimBuster	18575	And this isn't -- this isn't going to be necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	18576	What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the president has just sort of described one kind of mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	18577	I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend.	0
ClaimBuster	18578	A President can't know everything, but a President has to know those things that are essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our laws.	0
ClaimBuster	18579	Now, I'll tell ya this.	0
ClaimBuster	18580	And we have uninsured people in my state.	1
ClaimBuster	18581	If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.	0
ClaimBuster	18582	And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.	0
ClaimBuster	18583	Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.	1
ClaimBuster	18584	There is pending now in the Congress a national hate crimes law because of James Byrd, because of Matthew Shepard, who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots, and because of others.	1
ClaimBuster	18585	I've got a different view.	0
ClaimBuster	18586	We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.	0
ClaimBuster	18587	And she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process.	0
ClaimBuster	18588	Medicare -- I cast the tie-breaking vote to add 26 years to the life of Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	18589	As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	18590	And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18591	He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.	1
ClaimBuster	18592	And that's what is going to happen should I earn your confidence.	0
ClaimBuster	18593	We'll bring back manufacturing to America.	0
ClaimBuster	18594	For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free.	0
ClaimBuster	18595	But I'm not proud of any record, sir, I'm not.	0
ClaimBuster	18596	So I want to get some relief to middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	18597	So the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that's hurting rather badly.	0
ClaimBuster	18598	Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.	1
ClaimBuster	18599	Well, Andrea, you didn't predicate that lack of economists' support for what I call a flexible freeze, because some good very good economists do support that concept.	0
ClaimBuster	18600	Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area.	0
ClaimBuster	18601	There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts.	0
ClaimBuster	18602	The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once they're elected and start cutting.	0
ClaimBuster	18603	We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues.	1
ClaimBuster	18604	And I'm proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don't have as much pollution, that don't burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	18605	We need to cover more kids.	0
ClaimBuster	18606	We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida.	0
ClaimBuster	18607	We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.	0
ClaimBuster	18608	They're going to be put to death.	1
ClaimBuster	18609	You know, and everybody's ducking it so I'm gonna say it, that we are not letting that surplus stay in the bank.	0
ClaimBuster	18610	Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.	0
ClaimBuster	18611	And also, I'm going to institute zero-based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia, which uh - assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent.	1
ClaimBuster	18612	I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but I'm for what I just described to the lady.	0
ClaimBuster	18613	But that's what I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	18614	So I'll just keep saying, I am one.	0
ClaimBuster	18615	I think that the American people also need to be a little more responsible and think about whether there's a connection with their lives and what we do in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	18616	Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.	0
ClaimBuster	18617	My opponent said that America must pass a global test before we used force to protect ourselves.	1
ClaimBuster	18618	And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	18619	He said nice things about me.	1
ClaimBuster	18620	And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.	0
ClaimBuster	18621	Well, the invasion of Afghanistan didn't take place on our watch.	1
ClaimBuster	18622	And I have not made it an issue, nor should it be.	0
ClaimBuster	18623	After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	18624	A mission that doesn't try to be all things to all people.	0
ClaimBuster	18625	Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have.	0
ClaimBuster	18626	And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase.	1
ClaimBuster	18627	And I think to answer your question, I think both of us care a lot about the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	18628	"By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, ""Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China."""	1
ClaimBuster	18629	We don't need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	18630	And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.	0
ClaimBuster	18631	We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	18632	And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.	0
ClaimBuster	18633	The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.	0
ClaimBuster	18634	There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	18635	I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.	0
ClaimBuster	18636	She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.	1
ClaimBuster	18637	Look, I fully recognize I'm not of Washington.	1
ClaimBuster	18638	They have the bargain of the century.	0
ClaimBuster	18639	And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that don't work at all.	0
ClaimBuster	18640	But not a one of those key democratic leaders support our policy in Central America.	1
ClaimBuster	18641	Those decisions generally -- generally are not poll-tested.	1
ClaimBuster	18642	That's what this election is about.	0
ClaimBuster	18643	This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.	0
ClaimBuster	18644	They're very important parts of the safety net of health care.	0
ClaimBuster	18645	And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when -- when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street?	1
ClaimBuster	18646	They've got people allowed to go into churches now and political meetings without any showing of potential criminal activity or otherwise.	0
ClaimBuster	18647	Legislators make law; judges interpret the Constitution.	1
ClaimBuster	18648	A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.	0
ClaimBuster	18649	So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.	0
ClaimBuster	18650	They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail.	0
ClaimBuster	18651	And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingle-Norwood bill, which is the main one pending.	1
ClaimBuster	18652	I started with a $1 million loan.	1
ClaimBuster	18653	I just have an honest philosophical difference.	0
ClaimBuster	18654	I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending.	0
ClaimBuster	18655	No, I am confident about the American economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18656	But let's go back to the original point.	0
ClaimBuster	18657	Well, I actually agree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	18658	We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.	0
ClaimBuster	18659	We are never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and that's not how it's going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	18660	China has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor.	1
ClaimBuster	18661	If they do, they're make-work jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	18662	Then finally, our government passes laws and freezes the plan in concrete.	1
ClaimBuster	18663	And so it's a combination of these things.	0
ClaimBuster	18664	They are members of NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	18665	I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.	0
ClaimBuster	18666	I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president.	0
ClaimBuster	18667	We're weak in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18668	That was a mistake as well, and it cost thousands of jobs for American workers in the Midwest and all over the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	18669	Now, there are all kinds of good ideas, brilliant ideas, terrific ideas on health care.	0
ClaimBuster	18670	I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.	1
ClaimBuster	18671	I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	18672	Now all you got that tax cut, congratulations.	0
ClaimBuster	18673	I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.	0
ClaimBuster	18674	I mean, look at the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	18675	I'll give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	18676	It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	18677	There's much we can do with them with respect to homeland security.	0
ClaimBuster	18678	There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.	1
ClaimBuster	18679	If you get grassroots America excited about it, and if they tap Congress on the shoulder and say do it, Charlie, it'll happen.	0
ClaimBuster	18680	You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.	0
ClaimBuster	18681	Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be.	0
ClaimBuster	18682	Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money?	0
ClaimBuster	18683	That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.	1
ClaimBuster	18684	Let me tell you what we have done.	0
ClaimBuster	18685	It would be very disturbing to American people.	0
ClaimBuster	18686	I don't want to send troops any place.	0
ClaimBuster	18687	But I'll tell you this: As president, I'll never take my eye off that ball.	0
ClaimBuster	18688	And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.	0
ClaimBuster	18689	Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.	1
ClaimBuster	18690	It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	18691	They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the -- in the relatively near future.	0
ClaimBuster	18692	But the deterrent -- and that's what it is for -- is also what led me to propose what is now being called the Star Wars concept, but propose that we research to see if there isn't a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missiles.	0
ClaimBuster	18693	So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.	0
ClaimBuster	18694	Do we need to fix it, particularly for OGBYNs (sic) and for brain surgeons and others?	0
ClaimBuster	18695	But we do need to make sure that as we -- as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on -- on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.	0
ClaimBuster	18696	That's really what you're -- when they ask about the mistakes, that's what they're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	18697	It wasn't until we had a Republican Congress you even thought about, you talked about tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	18698	This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.	1
ClaimBuster	18699	Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well.	1
ClaimBuster	18700	I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and we've moved millions of people in America into good jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	18701	This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18702	But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate.	1
ClaimBuster	18703	I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me.	1
ClaimBuster	18704	First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	18705	You've already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart.	1
ClaimBuster	18706	I know that I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the fact that this country gave me opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	18707	I know the President's supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what he's saying, with what I have said or what my positions are.	0
ClaimBuster	18708	You thought it should have been 5,000 troops...	1
ClaimBuster	18709	Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives.	0
ClaimBuster	18710	That's not true in Connecticut, family income is down.	1
ClaimBuster	18711	4th in manufacturing jobs, 4th in the reduction of poverty, 4th in income increase.	1
ClaimBuster	18712	Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.	0
ClaimBuster	18713	So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	18714	There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.	0
ClaimBuster	18715	Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.	0
ClaimBuster	18716	The only people affected by my plan are the top income earners of America.	1
ClaimBuster	18717	When I was that far ahead, it was immediately following the Democratic Convention, and before the Republican Convention.	0
ClaimBuster	18718	I spent my life in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	18719	There is no policy of this government to give to the People's Republic, or to sell to the People's Republic of China, military equipment.	1
ClaimBuster	18720	The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	18721	We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	18722	I vetoed it when they shut the government down.	1
ClaimBuster	18723	You didn't even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president.	1
ClaimBuster	18724	So we've got to get our education system right.	0
ClaimBuster	18725	Nobody touched that tar baby till the day after election in 1988 because they were flooding both parties with crooked PAC money, and it was in many cases stolen PAC money.	1
ClaimBuster	18726	Here they're leaving the skies and the environment behind.	0
ClaimBuster	18727	Yes, I voted for it, supported it.	1
ClaimBuster	18728	The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.	0
ClaimBuster	18729	Let me just make it clear: I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security.	0
ClaimBuster	18730	We're now at under 285.	1
ClaimBuster	18731	And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.	0
ClaimBuster	18732	And I think it's very important for the American president, as well as other Western leaders, to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	18733	It seems like they can't get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	18734	Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings?	0
ClaimBuster	18735	And it's an overall sign of weakness.	0
ClaimBuster	18736	We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	18737	The Secretary of State admitted that this morning.	1
ClaimBuster	18738	The Soviet Union does understand strength.	0
ClaimBuster	18739	The democratic leaders of Central and Latin America want to work with us.	0
ClaimBuster	18740	American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo.	1
ClaimBuster	18741	And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.	0
ClaimBuster	18742	This would take a lot of negotiation.	0
ClaimBuster	18743	Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters -- to you -- which path we should take.	0
ClaimBuster	18744	The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.	1
ClaimBuster	18745	They are a tough and a ruthless adversary, and we must be prepared to meet that challenge, and I would.	0
ClaimBuster	18746	I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	18747	I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives.	0
ClaimBuster	18748	And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it.	0
ClaimBuster	18749	We need to do more than that.	0
ClaimBuster	18750	Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure.	1
ClaimBuster	18751	Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.	0
ClaimBuster	18752	And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	18753	This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination and it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida but we disrupt terrorist safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support.	0
ClaimBuster	18754	I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	18755	You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.	0
ClaimBuster	18756	We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet.	0
ClaimBuster	18757	It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision?	0
ClaimBuster	18758	I was on my peroration.	0
ClaimBuster	18759	That's not fair for our future.	0
ClaimBuster	18760	I've served under a number of presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	18761	He misled the American people when he said we'd go to war as a last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	18762	And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.	1
ClaimBuster	18763	And you know why he gets that count?	0
ClaimBuster	18764	So we've got to get it under control and there's one last point I'd make.	0
ClaimBuster	18765	But it will cover preexisting conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	18766	And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.	1
ClaimBuster	18767	We're starting to see gains in math and science.	1
ClaimBuster	18768	And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children.	0
ClaimBuster	18769	Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.	0
ClaimBuster	18770	Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	18771	The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare.	1
ClaimBuster	18772	But the important thing is, what are we going to do now.	0
ClaimBuster	18773	It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.	1
ClaimBuster	18774	I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.	0
ClaimBuster	18775	The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that's sensitive to our people's needs - to those who are poor, who don't have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who've been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart.	0
ClaimBuster	18776	I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what we're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	18777	It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.	0
ClaimBuster	18778	[Laughter] And yet, that's the most important single issue of our time.	0
ClaimBuster	18779	The intelligence-gathering and the law-enforcement arms of the FBI just couldn't share intelligence under the old law.	1
ClaimBuster	18780	And any objective observer has said it's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	18781	I see what it does.	0
ClaimBuster	18782	The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?	0
ClaimBuster	18783	I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income.	0
ClaimBuster	18784	I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	18785	These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	18786	The good news is (inaudible).	0
ClaimBuster	18787	I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.	0
ClaimBuster	18788	The tax increase I have proposed triggers in at family incomes of $200,000 and above.	1
ClaimBuster	18789	The Soviets take out more than we do and the principle of intrusive verification.	0
ClaimBuster	18790	There's no question about that.	0
ClaimBuster	18791	In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.	1
ClaimBuster	18792	On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.	1
ClaimBuster	18793	Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt?	0
ClaimBuster	18794	This was a trick on the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	18795	Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am.	0
ClaimBuster	18796	It's about selecting a president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	18797	Now it's true that we disagree on this.	1
ClaimBuster	18798	Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?	0
ClaimBuster	18799	Probably never heard of him.	0
ClaimBuster	18800	When you go to bed tonight, look at your children.	0
ClaimBuster	18801	So, what -- what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map.	0
ClaimBuster	18802	They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.	1
ClaimBuster	18803	Thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	18804	We had a better idea.	0
ClaimBuster	18805	Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?	0
ClaimBuster	18806	We came from 100 different corners of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	18807	So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries.	0
ClaimBuster	18808	All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I've made, I've kept.	1
ClaimBuster	18809	Let's try to expand our markets abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	18810	"We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, ""Well, you know what?"	0
ClaimBuster	18811	I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	18812	It's a great honor for me to be here standing here as the Republican nominee.	0
ClaimBuster	18813	Now, we have a big difference on this.	0
ClaimBuster	18814	I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it.	0
ClaimBuster	18815	I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I.	1
ClaimBuster	18816	And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.	0
ClaimBuster	18817	I will -- I pledge to you I will do whatever is necessary to make sure that it stays that way.	0
ClaimBuster	18818	I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level.	0
ClaimBuster	18819	But it seems to me the kids ought to -- if they've started, they ought to stop and just don't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	18820	He has never been involved in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	18821	What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth.	1
ClaimBuster	18822	Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved.	0
ClaimBuster	18823	You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.	0
ClaimBuster	18824	I thought that was a good model.	0
ClaimBuster	18825	You cannot lead an alliance if you say, you know, you're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	18826	Our military is the strongest military in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	18827	And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...	0
ClaimBuster	18828	A few uh - months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	18829	And John tells us that first, we've got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	18830	It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	18831	I don't suggest that, I don't support it.	0
ClaimBuster	18832	That's what my campaign is all about and that's what it'll continue to be all about.	0
ClaimBuster	18833	I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	18834	And so -- on the logging issue.	0
ClaimBuster	18835	And so my question is...	0
ClaimBuster	18836	And they know that I'll take care of them.	0
ClaimBuster	18837	I would not use American ground forces in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	18838	But I have spent my whole life serving this country.	1
ClaimBuster	18839	But I hope we can talk about what we're going to do in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	18840	I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.	1
ClaimBuster	18841	But he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	18842	We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we've developed oil and natural gas.	1
ClaimBuster	18843	It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.	1
ClaimBuster	18844	I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	18845	Nowadays - 75 percent were for Israel before.	1
ClaimBuster	18846	You know people who've lost their jobs and lost their homes?	0
ClaimBuster	18847	We sent up a good bill on clean water, a sound bill on clean water.	0
ClaimBuster	18848	All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	18849	And we never picked him up on that and did what was necessary to transfer authority and to transfer reconstruction.	1
ClaimBuster	18850	I think that we should move step-by-step toward universal health coverage, but I am not in favor of government doing it all.	0
ClaimBuster	18851	But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that's why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	18852	I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned -- I put it this way; I think it's wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil.	0
ClaimBuster	18853	Now, what I've said is we should end this war responsibly.	0
ClaimBuster	18854	Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.	0
ClaimBuster	18855	I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.	0
ClaimBuster	18856	And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.	1
ClaimBuster	18857	But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions.	0
ClaimBuster	18858	And now there's 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops.	1
ClaimBuster	18859	And I think it's time you take a stand...	0
ClaimBuster	18860	K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there's a deficiency.	0
ClaimBuster	18861	Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.	1
ClaimBuster	18862	Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	18863	I was talking about Mr. Ford.	1
ClaimBuster	18864	That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.	1
ClaimBuster	18865	I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities.	1
ClaimBuster	18866	Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and that's exactly what I'm going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	18867	And you really have to pay attention to words.	0
ClaimBuster	18868	They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug.	1
ClaimBuster	18869	This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done.	0
ClaimBuster	18870	We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.	0
ClaimBuster	18871	We can't shortchange those things.	0
ClaimBuster	18872	I am very concerned about it.	0
ClaimBuster	18873	Well, there are various elements of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	18874	What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?	1
ClaimBuster	18875	Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left.	0
ClaimBuster	18876	What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.	1
ClaimBuster	18877	I believe strongly that the federal government can help, we need to fund Headstart.	0
ClaimBuster	18878	The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	18879	"My opponent at one time said, ""Well, get me elected, I'll have them out of there in six months."""	1
ClaimBuster	18880	And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasn't worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies.	0
ClaimBuster	18881	And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	18882	But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people.	0
ClaimBuster	18883	Coming from the political process.	0
ClaimBuster	18884	I think the Head Start program is a great program.	0
ClaimBuster	18885	I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning.	1
ClaimBuster	18886	Well another thing we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	18887	Their aspirations are similar to young people's here.	0
ClaimBuster	18888	unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	18889	In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.	1
ClaimBuster	18890	In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	18891	I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.	0
ClaimBuster	18892	And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.	0
ClaimBuster	18893	And so I believe the answer is, I'm going to win it because I'm getting into focus my agenda for America's renewal, and also I think that Governor Clinton's had pretty much of a free ride.	0
ClaimBuster	18894	And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state.	0
ClaimBuster	18895	You know several states now are letting people vote over three weeks.	1
ClaimBuster	18896	And that's what we've done over the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	18897	Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	18898	For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field.	1
ClaimBuster	18899	Is the guy out of work better off?	0
ClaimBuster	18900	Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created.	1
ClaimBuster	18901	We come together both Republicans and Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	18902	Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it.	1
ClaimBuster	18903	These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	18904	But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	18905	And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.	1
ClaimBuster	18906	And there is an example.	0
ClaimBuster	18907	And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	18908	Well, one of the things that I tried to do was to make sure that everybody in the country who was under a managed care plan should at least have three choices of plans, and would have the right to get out without penalty every year.	1
ClaimBuster	18909	Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	18910	It encourages them to begin a war.	0
ClaimBuster	18911	My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.	0
ClaimBuster	18912	But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.	1
ClaimBuster	18913	In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.	0
ClaimBuster	18914	I know why jobs come and why they go.	0
ClaimBuster	18915	You haven't heard me mention this before, but we're getting close now and I think it's about time I start putting things in perspective.	0
ClaimBuster	18916	And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	18917	We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses.	1
ClaimBuster	18918	We both want to help the old people.	0
ClaimBuster	18919	But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	18920	We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.	1
ClaimBuster	18921	There's no doubt it√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s gonna affect our budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	18922	"He said, ""It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.''"	0
ClaimBuster	18923	I don't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America.	0
ClaimBuster	18924	But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.	0
ClaimBuster	18925	And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	18926	A profound scientist recently made a different --	0
ClaimBuster	18927	First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	18928	I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low.	0
ClaimBuster	18929	He's a brave, brave man.	0
ClaimBuster	18930	We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.	1
ClaimBuster	18931	I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll.	1
ClaimBuster	18932	I've got a pen, and I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk.	0
ClaimBuster	18933	It's not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me.	0
ClaimBuster	18934	She doesn't have the stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	18935	The rest either abstained or voted against us.	1
ClaimBuster	18936	But I support the death penalty in the most heinous cases.	0
ClaimBuster	18937	So what, what is in my plan and I think it's almost identical in Senator Dole's plans is we make more people eligible to save in an IRA and let couples, married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to, for medical emergencies or buy a home or education, but they could also save to supplement retirement.	0
ClaimBuster	18938	I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs.	1
ClaimBuster	18939	If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	18940	But -- but it'll -- it'll -- it'll be...	0
ClaimBuster	18941	What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid.	0
ClaimBuster	18942	We didn't guard the nuclear facilities.	1
ClaimBuster	18943	I'm very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I'm trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	18944	I agree with what he's talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	18945	And I think this is a record that uh - the American people understand and will appreciate.	0
ClaimBuster	18946	We've become very, very sloppy.	0
ClaimBuster	18947	Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.	1
ClaimBuster	18948	In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.	1
ClaimBuster	18949	I thought that was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	18950	Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.	1
ClaimBuster	18951	But are the American people?	0
ClaimBuster	18952	And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years.	1
ClaimBuster	18953	He didn't honor the agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	18954	We will strengthen our intelligence-gathering services.	0
ClaimBuster	18955	The people of the United States individually could not have developed the Tennessee Valley; collectively they could have.	0
ClaimBuster	18956	Now, let me just share something.	0
ClaimBuster	18957	And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land.	1
ClaimBuster	18958	And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	18959	Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	18960	I'm not going to worry about it anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	18961	But we ought to stand staunch.	0
ClaimBuster	18962	And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations.	1
ClaimBuster	18963	It's possible to detect those kind of tests.	1
ClaimBuster	18964	I want to thank you for listening tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	18965	I will not cut our military budget.	0
ClaimBuster	18966	It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach.	0
ClaimBuster	18967	And so we decimated Al Qaida's core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	18968	Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work -- but I guess I would have voted with the majority.	1
ClaimBuster	18969	Now, that I think has to be our policy, because they are threatening to kill more Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	18970	And you say Exxon and Mobil.	0
ClaimBuster	18971	But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating.	0
ClaimBuster	18972	And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.	0
ClaimBuster	18973	Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.	0
ClaimBuster	18974	Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that.	0
ClaimBuster	18975	I would not ship that Arab country anything - no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	18976	It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	18977	"You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, ""Well, this is just a grand diversion."""	0
ClaimBuster	18978	Over the next four years, we'll continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country's neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	18979	Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?	0
ClaimBuster	18980	And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people.	0
ClaimBuster	18981	And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.	1
ClaimBuster	18982	I'll just mention one -- the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago.	0
ClaimBuster	18983	My friend, I'd like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	18984	America and Americans decide not just what's happening in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	18985	That's why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here.	0
ClaimBuster	18986	Now we have two major carrier task forces.	1
ClaimBuster	18987	"The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me."""	0
ClaimBuster	18988	But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families.	1
ClaimBuster	18989	That sense is something that I want to restore.	0
ClaimBuster	18990	But I'm feeling a little better tonight, and I'll tell you why.	0
ClaimBuster	18991	But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.	0
ClaimBuster	18992	And that's exactly what it's done.	1
ClaimBuster	18993	But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers, and 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act.	1
ClaimBuster	18994	What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.	0
ClaimBuster	18995	I mean, I'm -- I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program.	0
ClaimBuster	18996	Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	18997	I flew a combat mission, my last one was over Manila.	1
ClaimBuster	18998	And I would hope that we would give to women in this country the right to make that decision, and to make it in the exercise of their conscience and religious beliefs.	0
ClaimBuster	18999	We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy.	0
ClaimBuster	19000	So I really don't think so.	0
ClaimBuster	19001	The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	19002	I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy.	0
ClaimBuster	19003	This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future.	0
ClaimBuster	19004	But isn't the real question that we have to answer not how many exceptions we make, because the vice president himself is prepared to make exceptions.	0
ClaimBuster	19005	I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.	0
ClaimBuster	19006	We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	19007	With her, it's all talk and no action.	0
ClaimBuster	19008	Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view.	0
ClaimBuster	19009	Reduce the White House staff by a 3rd after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff.	0
ClaimBuster	19010	Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.	1
ClaimBuster	19011	Maybe there is no hacking.	0
ClaimBuster	19012	It's not trickle down economics.	0
ClaimBuster	19013	As soon as she releases them, I will release.	0
ClaimBuster	19014	The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives.	1
ClaimBuster	19015	I've spent my life creating jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	19016	We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured.	0
ClaimBuster	19017	There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa.	1
ClaimBuster	19018	I'm going to change that.	0
ClaimBuster	19019	This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	19020	This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level.	0
ClaimBuster	19021	My -- my passion probably flows from the fact that I believe in God.	0
ClaimBuster	19022	I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?	0
ClaimBuster	19023	We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.	1
ClaimBuster	19024	We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.	1
ClaimBuster	19025	These are unidentified people, and after the bomb goes off, they're blown to bits because they are suicidal individuals who think they're going to go to paradise if they perpetrate such an act and lose their life in doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	19026	The facts are you now have a government that comes at you.	0
ClaimBuster	19027	And the facts are facts and records are records.	0
ClaimBuster	19028	We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards.	0
ClaimBuster	19029	We're going to say you have a five-year limit.	0
ClaimBuster	19030	It says let's give parents the choice of a public, private or public school -- public, private or religious school.	1
ClaimBuster	19031	And over the last summers I've flown over there.	1
ClaimBuster	19032	And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements.	0
ClaimBuster	19033	My opponent opposed the missile defenses.	1
ClaimBuster	19034	It would not be appropriate for me to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	19035	And one of the things that the Vice President either ignores or won't address is the fact that you can't divorce our military security from our economic security.	0
ClaimBuster	19036	That's why we've invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars.	1
ClaimBuster	19037	He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	19038	That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.	1
ClaimBuster	19039	those imports have been reduced.	1
ClaimBuster	19040	I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	19041	But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	19042	We're going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize.	0
ClaimBuster	19043	We've had several fragmentary efforts by members of the Congress and by - by private citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	19044	And they recognize we got great difficulties, but they're also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	19045	We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...	0
ClaimBuster	19046	Yes, we got problems at home.	1
ClaimBuster	19047	And the reason I'm worried is because there's a vicious enemy that has an ideology of hate.	0
ClaimBuster	19048	And uh - that would be another factor that I would follow.	0
ClaimBuster	19049	And we're going to get the great entrepreneurial spirit of this country, and we're going to free ourselves from this dependency on Mideast oil.	0
ClaimBuster	19050	Many of you viewers don't know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school.	1
ClaimBuster	19051	And I think that's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	19052	I have met with the heads of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally.	1
ClaimBuster	19053	Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away.	0
ClaimBuster	19054	Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	19055	Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	19056	The president said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process.	1
ClaimBuster	19057	... go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.	1
ClaimBuster	19058	These problems are not easy.	0
ClaimBuster	19059	You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids.	0
ClaimBuster	19060	How did we get on to Putin?	0
ClaimBuster	19061	I have to take ten seconds here at the end -- the red light isn't on yet -- to say to Ross Perot, please don't say to the DEA agents on the street that we don't have the will to fight drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	19062	They have too many employees.	0
ClaimBuster	19063	It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?	0
ClaimBuster	19064	Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?	0
ClaimBuster	19065	That's the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	19066	We need to accelerate the drug approval process.	0
ClaimBuster	19067	And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.	0
ClaimBuster	19068	That's the difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	19069	I'm opposed to these policies as well.	0
ClaimBuster	19070	Actually, it's not an empty promise.	0
ClaimBuster	19071	Third, I think it's possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts.	0
ClaimBuster	19072	Well, he doesn't like trickle down government but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	19073	First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks.	1
ClaimBuster	19074	So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?	0
ClaimBuster	19075	I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	19076	-- I couldn't agree with you more, couldn't agree with you more.	0
ClaimBuster	19077	And then you wouldn't have had them.	0
ClaimBuster	19078	I suggest you might consider somebody who's created jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	19079	The point I want to make to you is, a bipartisan commission reviewed my plan and the Bush plan and there were as many Republicans as Democratic health care experts on it.	1
ClaimBuster	19080	Is -- are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?	0
ClaimBuster	19081	And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they're self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees.	1
ClaimBuster	19082	But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement.	0
ClaimBuster	19083	But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.	0
ClaimBuster	19084	"Next thing I know, one of these ACT UP groups is out saying, ""Bush ought to change his behavior."""	0
ClaimBuster	19085	I said I did if administered fairly and justly.	0
ClaimBuster	19086	We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.	1
ClaimBuster	19087	If one vote per precinct had changed in 1960, John Kennedy would never have been President of this nation.	1
ClaimBuster	19088	Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	19089	I haven't made a promise about...	0
ClaimBuster	19090	But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was.	0
ClaimBuster	19091	We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.	0
ClaimBuster	19092	Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.	1
ClaimBuster	19093	And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information.	0
ClaimBuster	19094	First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.	1
ClaimBuster	19095	Are you afraid I couldn't hear him?	0
ClaimBuster	19096	And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.	0
ClaimBuster	19097	But we've got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes.	0
ClaimBuster	19098	We have to keep Americans' taxes low.	0
ClaimBuster	19099	But in any event, I think we just look at the facts.	0
ClaimBuster	19100	Talk about the VA: We've increased VA funding by $22 billion in the four years since I've been president.	1
ClaimBuster	19101	We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	19102	That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.	0
ClaimBuster	19103	If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	19104	Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.	0
ClaimBuster	19105	I really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly.	0
ClaimBuster	19106	Of course it's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee.	0
ClaimBuster	19107	But that was 10 years before you took office.	1
ClaimBuster	19108	...I would liquidate the industry.	0
ClaimBuster	19109	He cut if off, sort of arbitrarily.	1
ClaimBuster	19110	That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration.	1
ClaimBuster	19111	Now, it's hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years.	1
ClaimBuster	19112	And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place.	1
ClaimBuster	19113	The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan.	1
ClaimBuster	19114	I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.	0
ClaimBuster	19115	Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	19116	Because we reduced the deficit four years in a row.	1
ClaimBuster	19117	And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.	1
ClaimBuster	19118	I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate.	0
ClaimBuster	19119	I would tighten those sanctions further.	0
ClaimBuster	19120	But they're matters that are ah - important.	0
ClaimBuster	19121	7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings -- 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million.	1
ClaimBuster	19122	But they see a compassionate, strong, great first lady in Laura Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	19123	But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.	0
ClaimBuster	19124	That's what we've been going through for the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	19125	So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record.	0
ClaimBuster	19126	The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.	1
ClaimBuster	19127	So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.	1
ClaimBuster	19128	I voted for small-business tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	19129	It's understandable that a Senator in the preliminary debates can make an irresponsible statement, or, maybe, an ill-advised statement.	0
ClaimBuster	19130	We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history.	0
ClaimBuster	19131	I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	19132	And I suspect he'll keep those too.	0
ClaimBuster	19133	I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	19134	I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill.	0
ClaimBuster	19135	This state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership.	1
ClaimBuster	19136	We had a better idea.	0
ClaimBuster	19137	And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.	0
ClaimBuster	19138	You're talking about 2 different subjects.	1
ClaimBuster	19139	That's why I want to invest in you.	0
ClaimBuster	19140	Thank you, and that's an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it.	0
ClaimBuster	19141	Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and they're angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	19142	That's why I'm asking for your vote and that's why I'm asking for another four years.	0
ClaimBuster	19143	If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else.	0
ClaimBuster	19144	The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.	0
ClaimBuster	19145	If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	19146	And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.	0
ClaimBuster	19147	And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny.	0
ClaimBuster	19148	Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it.	0
ClaimBuster	19149	We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...	1
ClaimBuster	19150	I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things.	0
ClaimBuster	19151	As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination.	1
ClaimBuster	19152	Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.	1
ClaimBuster	19153	Secondly, I don't have any litmus test.	0
ClaimBuster	19154	This has been a very successful effort.	0
ClaimBuster	19155	Let me just say one final example.	0
ClaimBuster	19156	Since the assassination of our best leaders in the '60's, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	19157	But I will tell you, I sat there...	0
ClaimBuster	19158	I thought it was a bad decision.	0
ClaimBuster	19159	So let's get the record straight.	0
ClaimBuster	19160	It means that Governor Romney...	0
ClaimBuster	19161	I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.	0
ClaimBuster	19162	We have, to one-third of what it was.	1
ClaimBuster	19163	(Applause) But don't take it out of my time!	0
ClaimBuster	19164	Well, had we joined the Kyoto treaty, which I guess he's referring to, it would have cost America a lot of jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	19165	I want to leave money in your pocket.	0
ClaimBuster	19166	This is in our country, folks, the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	19167	We have millions of people that did it the right way.	1
ClaimBuster	19168	Those investments are what's going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy, not just next year, but 10 years from now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now.	1
ClaimBuster	19169	The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations.	0
ClaimBuster	19170	I have a plan that's going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early.	0
ClaimBuster	19171	And I have been a secretary of state...	1
ClaimBuster	19172	Certainly education and training is crucial.	0
ClaimBuster	19173	I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.	0
ClaimBuster	19174	We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.	0
ClaimBuster	19175	So all of this is possible.	0
ClaimBuster	19176	And we've just got to make sure, before somebody thinks they're buying a product, that it works.	0
ClaimBuster	19177	And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	19178	I served my country in Vietnam.	1
ClaimBuster	19179	Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.	0
ClaimBuster	19180	The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.	0
ClaimBuster	19181	"This is the same thing we heard -- remember, I appeared on ""Meet the Press"" with Tim Russert in 1990-something."	1
ClaimBuster	19182	I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us.	0
ClaimBuster	19183	It was the right decision.	0
ClaimBuster	19184	Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start.	0
ClaimBuster	19185	A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers.	1
ClaimBuster	19186	So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.	0
ClaimBuster	19187	And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.	0
ClaimBuster	19188	There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	19189	We've been through a lot together as a country -- been through a recession, corporate scandals, war.	0
ClaimBuster	19190	You talk about somebody strong.	1
ClaimBuster	19191	Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined.	1
ClaimBuster	19192	Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.	1
ClaimBuster	19193	I don't want to stampede.	0
ClaimBuster	19194	But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns.	1
ClaimBuster	19195	I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.	0
ClaimBuster	19196	It's called the Buffett rule.	1
ClaimBuster	19197	The result was that the Guatemalan people themselves eventually rose up and they threw him out.	1
ClaimBuster	19198	Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.	1
ClaimBuster	19199	We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.	0
ClaimBuster	19200	Where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?	0
ClaimBuster	19201	But I made the decision because I thought it was in the right interests of our security.	0
ClaimBuster	19202	He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.	1
ClaimBuster	19203	I apologize to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	19204	Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities -- through the Urban Development Action Grant Program.	0
ClaimBuster	19205	It didn't meet my test.	0
ClaimBuster	19206	I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.	0
ClaimBuster	19207	Who can give themselves a 23% pay raise anywhere in the world except Congress?	0
ClaimBuster	19208	I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong.	1
ClaimBuster	19209	We have to be the strongest economic power in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	19210	And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible.	0
ClaimBuster	19211	He is alive today because of the criminal justice system.	0
ClaimBuster	19212	I'm proud of the record of this Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	19213	Number three, we'd open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income.	0
ClaimBuster	19214	They've only approved about 10% of the agenda I've helped to send up there.	1
ClaimBuster	19215	And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the Cold War.	0
ClaimBuster	19216	I am concerned about a tax on Muslims, for example, over there.	1
ClaimBuster	19217	Let me just take two seconds of my time because I'm the Commander-in-Chief to respond to one thing that was said.	1
ClaimBuster	19218	But we have work to do in this nation.	0
ClaimBuster	19219	It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.	0
ClaimBuster	19220	Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.	0
ClaimBuster	19221	Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright.	0
ClaimBuster	19222	And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?	0
ClaimBuster	19223	And we uh - had the emperor of Japan here this uh - past year and the net result is Japan and the United States are working more closely together now than at any time in the history of our relationship.	1
ClaimBuster	19224	Governor Clinton clicked off the things -- he's going to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies.	0
ClaimBuster	19225	Since he's been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	19226	Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state.	0
ClaimBuster	19227	I think the American people will make their own decisions on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action I think they need to clearly understand the backgrounds of each person.	0
ClaimBuster	19228	They admit it's an issue.	1
ClaimBuster	19229	I'll have to get this out very fast.	0
ClaimBuster	19230	Now, they may blame other folks, but it's time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	19231	Now, that is the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	19232	You got that fact wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	19233	Now, again, if I get up there, if you send me, we're going to have some blunt talks about this, and we're really going to get down in the trenches and say, is this one you want to talk about or fix, because talk won't do it, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	19234	Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh - be made available.	1
ClaimBuster	19235	Well, let me--I have to correct one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	19236	They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.	0
ClaimBuster	19237	Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion a piece.	1
ClaimBuster	19238	I think we can do a better job.	0
ClaimBuster	19239	That's not the right course for us.	0
ClaimBuster	19240	Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.	1
ClaimBuster	19241	And then, I mentioned it the other night, I think if there's a crisis, people are going to say, well, George Bush has taken us through some tough crises, and we trust him to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	19242	You'll still have choice of doctor.	1
ClaimBuster	19243	I believe we can do better.	0
ClaimBuster	19244	I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.	0
ClaimBuster	19245	Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	19246	We must make this next century the century of the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	19247	They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything.	0
ClaimBuster	19248	We've got to drill offshore, my friends, and we've got to do it now, and we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	19249	You know, for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein.	1
ClaimBuster	19250	He's indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	19251	That's what I'd like them to know about me; that I've gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true.	0
ClaimBuster	19252	I think we are today.	0
ClaimBuster	19253	"When they said, ""We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding."""	1
ClaimBuster	19254	They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.	0
ClaimBuster	19255	Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.	0
ClaimBuster	19256	That is not good for America's position in the world, and the world notices.	0
ClaimBuster	19257	But I am discussing the power the President has to grant pardons.	0
ClaimBuster	19258	I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.	0
ClaimBuster	19259	I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor.	1
ClaimBuster	19260	The truth is what good policy is based on.	0
ClaimBuster	19261	I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.	0
ClaimBuster	19262	That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.	1
ClaimBuster	19263	Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?	0
ClaimBuster	19264	I am not quoting myself.	0
ClaimBuster	19265	Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant.	1
ClaimBuster	19266	I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.	0
ClaimBuster	19267	I will pay down the debt every year.	0
ClaimBuster	19268	But that's the good news.	0
ClaimBuster	19269	But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.	0
ClaimBuster	19270	We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.	1
ClaimBuster	19271	But this is an important issue.	0
ClaimBuster	19272	Median income is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	19273	And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country.	0
ClaimBuster	19274	It's not by trickle-down government, saying we're going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations.	0
ClaimBuster	19275	That's the kind of mindset that says sanctions were working.	0
ClaimBuster	19276	In my state, we're leading the country in private sector job growth.	1
ClaimBuster	19277	Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he's never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	19278	We want them to continue that.	0
ClaimBuster	19279	Now, everybody will faint in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	19280	And there, again, he sort of slid by the question.	0
ClaimBuster	19281	Do you want to fix the problem or sound-bite it?	0
ClaimBuster	19282	The other was could an administration change the tone in Washington, D.C. And I believe the answer is yes, otherwise I wouldn't be asking for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	19283	It's time for a new look.	0
ClaimBuster	19284	And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.	1
ClaimBuster	19285	So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste.	0
ClaimBuster	19286	I question - and I don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam.	0
ClaimBuster	19287	"Medicare -- the issue of Medicare used to be called ""Mediscare."""	1
ClaimBuster	19288	So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.	1
ClaimBuster	19289	This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years.	1
ClaimBuster	19290	More in August than July.	1
ClaimBuster	19291	But, what you can't do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	19292	So watch Ukraine, and let's make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.	0
ClaimBuster	19293	I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care.	0
ClaimBuster	19294	I believe he will go.	0
ClaimBuster	19295	You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.	1
ClaimBuster	19296	Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	19297	If - Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country - but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war.	1
ClaimBuster	19298	I'm a product of a public school.	1
ClaimBuster	19299	Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.	0
ClaimBuster	19300	And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	19301	We've made progress in Northern Ireland, in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	19302	And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.	0
ClaimBuster	19303	That's what my mission will be in the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	19304	And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man.	1
ClaimBuster	19305	They're hurting, and they're angry.	0
ClaimBuster	19306	There's no way you can pay for that five year, $40 billion tax cut for the rich and still buy all those weapons systems you want to buy unless you raid the Social Security Trust Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	19307	I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.	1
ClaimBuster	19308	So as we phase these industries over, there's a whole of intellectual talent in these industries.	0
ClaimBuster	19309	And finally, he says we ought to have a summit.	0
ClaimBuster	19310	You know, so one of your liberal friends.	0
ClaimBuster	19311	And the Taliban are no longer in power.	1
ClaimBuster	19312	Well, first let me say with respect to the freeze, that back in the spring of 1982 Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today.	0
ClaimBuster	19313	Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities.	1
ClaimBuster	19314	This permits them to maintain their self-respect.	0
ClaimBuster	19315	And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time.	0
ClaimBuster	19316	It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.	1
ClaimBuster	19317	I think it's worthy for a follow-up.	0
ClaimBuster	19318	And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.	0
ClaimBuster	19319	The Earned Income Tax Credit, sorry.	0
ClaimBuster	19320	That's why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	19321	Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler.	0
ClaimBuster	19322	As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.	0
ClaimBuster	19323	We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less.	1
ClaimBuster	19324	I'm going to cut regulations.	0
ClaimBuster	19325	People need to remember: Six months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down.	1
ClaimBuster	19326	"The Clear Skies bill that he just talked about, it's one of those Orwellian names you pull out of the sky, slap it onto something, like ""No Child Left Behind"" but you leave millions of children behind."	0
ClaimBuster	19327	Yes, I'd be glad to.	0
ClaimBuster	19328	You're going to be paying for it.	0
ClaimBuster	19329	It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.	0
ClaimBuster	19330	Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney's now promoting.	1
ClaimBuster	19331	Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.	0
ClaimBuster	19332	It was rather a vague statement that they finally made.	0
ClaimBuster	19333	Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.	0
ClaimBuster	19334	Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.	0
ClaimBuster	19335	Mr Bush sent two people in secret to toast the Chinese leaders and basically tell them not to worry about it.	1
ClaimBuster	19336	One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government.	0
ClaimBuster	19337	And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've -- we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once.	1
ClaimBuster	19338	I mean, these aren't make-up figures.	1
ClaimBuster	19339	I think that grows the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	19340	That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.	0
ClaimBuster	19341	Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America.	0
ClaimBuster	19342	And so what I've said is that there's been some missed opportunities.	0
ClaimBuster	19343	Are we as strong as we should be?	0
ClaimBuster	19344	And it's paid for, and I'll tell you how I'll pay for it.	0
ClaimBuster	19345	Anytime you think you want to legalize drugs, go to a neonatal unit -- if you can get in.	0
ClaimBuster	19346	That's what I've been critical about the administration for.	0
ClaimBuster	19347	But this is locker room talk.	0
ClaimBuster	19348	Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	19349	That's why I said to Afghanistan: If you harbor a terrorist, you're just as guilty as the terrorist.	1
ClaimBuster	19350	I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known.	0
ClaimBuster	19351	And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners.	0
ClaimBuster	19352	People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A.	1
ClaimBuster	19353	We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent.	0
ClaimBuster	19354	In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take.	0
ClaimBuster	19355	Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them.	1
ClaimBuster	19356	But they have to pay up.	0
ClaimBuster	19357	On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce.	1
ClaimBuster	19358	Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is...	0
ClaimBuster	19359	And it's important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes.	0
ClaimBuster	19360	And they're interested in what you're interested in.	0
ClaimBuster	19361	And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.	0
ClaimBuster	19362	I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh - give a tax reduction.	0
ClaimBuster	19363	Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.	0
ClaimBuster	19364	But unfortunately, in -- nowhere in the world is America's influence greater today than it was four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	19365	I'm just as sick as you are by having to wake up and figure out how to defend myself every day.	0
ClaimBuster	19366	And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.	0
ClaimBuster	19367	Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.	0
ClaimBuster	19368	But they always blame Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	19369	"Not a message a commander in chief gives, or this is a ""great diversion."""	0
ClaimBuster	19370	He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.	1
ClaimBuster	19371	You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them.	0
ClaimBuster	19372	We all fight over how much money is there.	0
ClaimBuster	19373	The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?	0
ClaimBuster	19374	In May of this year, Governor Carter took the first initiative, approximately twelve months after I had taken my initiative a year ago.	1
ClaimBuster	19375	I believe that we can work together.	0
ClaimBuster	19376	I have always opposed drawing a line.	1
ClaimBuster	19377	I haven't sorted out the penalties.	0
ClaimBuster	19378	And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits.	1
ClaimBuster	19379	But more importantly, we've reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early, before they're too late.	0
ClaimBuster	19380	I'd get rid of it.	0
ClaimBuster	19381	We share a common border with another nation.	1
ClaimBuster	19382	There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.	0
ClaimBuster	19383	That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details.	0
ClaimBuster	19384	They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space.	1
ClaimBuster	19385	And so I have great confidence in him.	0

ClaimBuster	19389	I don't know what affirmative access means.	0
ClaimBuster	19390	But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	19391	That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	19392	Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.	1

ClaimBuster	19396	She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame.	0
ClaimBuster	19397	And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.	1
ClaimBuster	19398	This is a relevant question here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	19399	This manual -- several thousands of which were produced -- was distributed, ordering political assassinations, hiring of criminals, and other forms of terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	19400	Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.	0
ClaimBuster	19401	And yet he tells you he's for a middle- class tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	19402	We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.	0
ClaimBuster	19403	Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.	0
ClaimBuster	19404	Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you.	0
ClaimBuster	19405	How strong is our economy?	0
ClaimBuster	19406	And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 to 11 Eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down, so we're going to come right down to that one.	1
ClaimBuster	19407	I did not support the war in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	19408	And you shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it.	0
ClaimBuster	19409	They just need the help to be trained.	0
ClaimBuster	19410	One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I'm going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and we've worked hard to bring this deficit down and that's helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower.	1
ClaimBuster	19411	We're blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	19412	No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care.	0
ClaimBuster	19413	or 15 months ago, on what he believed in.	0

ClaimBuster	19415	He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	19416	Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make.	0
ClaimBuster	19417	Now, here's what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	19418	You've proposed an approach that has a...	0
ClaimBuster	19419	And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly.	0
ClaimBuster	19420	At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women.	1
ClaimBuster	19421	I wouldn't deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I don't think he's the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state.	0
ClaimBuster	19422	And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.	1
ClaimBuster	19423	We've got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability that's efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused - fighting capability.	0
ClaimBuster	19424	I'll give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	19425	And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.	0
ClaimBuster	19426	And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.	0
ClaimBuster	19427	Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.	0
ClaimBuster	19428	And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.	0
ClaimBuster	19429	The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.	0
ClaimBuster	19430	In ruling out the defense of Korea, they invited aggression in that area.	0
ClaimBuster	19431	Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.	1
ClaimBuster	19432	We have to obviously cut spending.	0
ClaimBuster	19433	The Soviet Union is still jamming Radio Free Europe - Radio - uh- uh - Radio Free Europe is being jammed.	1
ClaimBuster	19434	Governor Carter uh - brags about the unemployment during Democratic administrations and condemns the unemployment at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	19435	When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now.	1
ClaimBuster	19436	So we've -- we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives.	0
ClaimBuster	19437	I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.	1
ClaimBuster	19438	If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	19439	Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.	0
ClaimBuster	19440	We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	19441	And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.	0
ClaimBuster	19442	You're a cardiologist, it wouldn't affect you.	1
ClaimBuster	19443	Well, two leading national news networks have both said the president's characterization of my health-care plan is incorrect.	1
ClaimBuster	19444	Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	19445	We also have to make the economy fairer.	0
ClaimBuster	19446	If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.	1
ClaimBuster	19447	Was this really going to war as a last resort?	0
ClaimBuster	19448	Now, when it comes to the issue of the environment, this is one of the worst administrations in modern history.	0
ClaimBuster	19449	I would like the record to show the panelists that Ross Perot took the first shot at the press.	0
ClaimBuster	19450	I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	19451	We don't have the S&L crisis anymore.	1
ClaimBuster	19452	We've turned the country upside down.	0
ClaimBuster	19453	I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it.	1
ClaimBuster	19454	So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?	0
ClaimBuster	19455	We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	19456	As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom.	1
ClaimBuster	19457	I don't think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge.	0
ClaimBuster	19458	There is a huge difference in this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	19459	That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	19460	The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long term priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	19461	There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	19462	We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.	1
ClaimBuster	19463	As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.	0
ClaimBuster	19464	And in terms of peace, we are on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	19465	Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples.	0
ClaimBuster	19466	It's being worked now in 1700 communities -- bypassed Congress on this one, Ross -- 1700 communities across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	19467	Uh - On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn't a problem because it's from Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	19468	"Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, ""Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded,'' and you have another totalitarian power on your hands."	0
ClaimBuster	19469	Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.	1
ClaimBuster	19470	But we have horrible deals.	0
ClaimBuster	19471	"I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, ""Be sure to say a prayer before you start your day's work."""	0
ClaimBuster	19472	Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al-Qaeda type individuals.	1
ClaimBuster	19473	And as president, I will always respect everybody's right to practice religion as they choose -- or not to practice -- because that's part of America.	0
ClaimBuster	19474	But the point is it's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence.	0
ClaimBuster	19475	I know what that√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s like when an army is defeated.	0
ClaimBuster	19476	But I will tell you, she's all talk.	0
ClaimBuster	19477	It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	19478	All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it.	0
ClaimBuster	19479	But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well.	0
ClaimBuster	19480	No, we'll get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	19481	Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education.	0
ClaimBuster	19482	It's going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people.	0
ClaimBuster	19483	I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson's theory.	1
ClaimBuster	19484	That's the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.	0
ClaimBuster	19485	Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	19486	When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, it's the largest increase in federal spending in years.	1
ClaimBuster	19487	Now last year, of course, was 1958.	1
ClaimBuster	19488	I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students.	0
ClaimBuster	19489	In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoed, I think that's what he's talking about, I actually wanted to sign that bill.	1
ClaimBuster	19490	And that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	19491	We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.	0
ClaimBuster	19492	Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.	0
ClaimBuster	19493	You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.	0
ClaimBuster	19494	It isn't an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy.	1
ClaimBuster	19495	And secondly, the people that murdered Mr. Byrd got the ultimate punishment.	1
ClaimBuster	19496	We have to get our economy going.	0
ClaimBuster	19497	If you ask me if I could fly a fighter plane or be an astronaut, I can't.	0
ClaimBuster	19498	The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries.	0
ClaimBuster	19499	And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.	1
ClaimBuster	19500	This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it -- if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got -- you've got terrorists there who could grab their -- their hands onto those nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	19501	We can't deal with them.	0
ClaimBuster	19502	When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	19503	Are we doing enough in that area?	0
ClaimBuster	19504	Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	19505	The president reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind.	1
ClaimBuster	19506	The mission must be clear.	0
ClaimBuster	19507	"I asked: ""Are you better off than you were 4 years before?''"	0
ClaimBuster	19508	I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it.	1
ClaimBuster	19509	But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment.	1
ClaimBuster	19510	And that's going to require more than is on the table today.	0
ClaimBuster	19511	Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers.	1
ClaimBuster	19512	Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.	0
ClaimBuster	19513	But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	19514	And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost.	0
ClaimBuster	19515	Congress passed a paperwork reduction act.	1
ClaimBuster	19516	And that's in all sections of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	19517	Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.	1
ClaimBuster	19518	Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	19519	And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	19520	We should try to reduce these circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	19521	It's ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time we've got the largest generation of students in public schools ever.	1
ClaimBuster	19522	We've been around for 240 years.	1
ClaimBuster	19523	We have the best health care delivery system in the world and we want to keep it that way.	0
ClaimBuster	19524	I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.	0
ClaimBuster	19525	That's the plan that I've put forward.	0
ClaimBuster	19526	And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment.	0
ClaimBuster	19527	(Laughter) I'm against that; I oppose that.	0
ClaimBuster	19528	33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	19529	There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	19530	They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country.	1
ClaimBuster	19531	Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.	1
ClaimBuster	19532	And we will never take military options off the table.	0
ClaimBuster	19533	Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	19534	And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.	1
ClaimBuster	19535	This was a bipartisan idea.	1
ClaimBuster	19536	Yes, we're having tough times, but we do not need to go back to the failed policies of the past, when you had a Democratic president and a spendthrift Democratic Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	19537	He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.	1
ClaimBuster	19538	When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.	1
ClaimBuster	19539	I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the president did a terrific job.	0
ClaimBuster	19540	Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so.	0
ClaimBuster	19541	That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	19542	In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	19543	Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.	0
ClaimBuster	19544	We have to bring back law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	19545	We all know about the vote held this week - of the five neutralists - and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	19546	I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.	0
ClaimBuster	19547	(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	19548	I -- I think interesting the president just said something which -- which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.	1
ClaimBuster	19549	I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be.	0
ClaimBuster	19550	You know, every life is precious.	0
ClaimBuster	19551	I hope a lot of --	0
ClaimBuster	19552	The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so - we're already five years behind in what we should be doing.	0
ClaimBuster	19553	So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	19554	He thinks, I think he said, that the country is coming apart at the seams.	0
ClaimBuster	19555	Their idea was a budget that the that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals.	1
ClaimBuster	19556	Uh - Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance - different kind of minerals, including oil.	1
ClaimBuster	19557	We'll never have that world leadership until we are strong at home, and we can have that strength if we return to the basic principles.	0
ClaimBuster	19558	We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	19559	I suggest, however, that in the interest of fairness that he could give me the benefit of also believing as he believes.	0
ClaimBuster	19560	I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and I said the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance.	1
ClaimBuster	19561	It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.	0
ClaimBuster	19562	And it's going to take all the nations together, just as when we banded together we pretty much resolved the whole problem of skyjackings sometime ago.	1
ClaimBuster	19563	He proposed more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined.	1
ClaimBuster	19564	One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.	1
ClaimBuster	19565	It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest.	1
ClaimBuster	19566	I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	19567	In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life.	1
ClaimBuster	19568	I would use pressure and diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	19569	But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.	1
ClaimBuster	19570	I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem.	0
ClaimBuster	19571	But when we make this into a divisive political issue, and when we don't have bipartisan support -- I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can't...	0
ClaimBuster	19572	She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.	0
ClaimBuster	19573	The president's not getting the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	19574	Thank you, well, first let me say that I signed the Family Leave Act.	1
ClaimBuster	19575	Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	19576	I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	19577	So that I'm hopeful we can try once more.	0
ClaimBuster	19578	Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.	1
ClaimBuster	19579	And I take it back, because I think -- he said he made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	19580	Now then, that money needs to be -- they don't even pay interest on it.	1
ClaimBuster	19581	but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	19582	Where did you find this?	0
ClaimBuster	19583	We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.	1
ClaimBuster	19584	Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers.	0
ClaimBuster	19585	He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.	0
ClaimBuster	19586	In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.	1
ClaimBuster	19587	I don't think a president can do that.	0
ClaimBuster	19588	Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	19589	And I know talks have started again today.	1
ClaimBuster	19590	I believe that it's in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries.	0
ClaimBuster	19591	Well, it isn't going to go back up.	0
ClaimBuster	19592	I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund.	1
ClaimBuster	19593	It shouldn't happen in America.	0
ClaimBuster	19594	It might help the contributions from coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times discovers it, $250,000.	0
ClaimBuster	19595	He cut 112 billion dollars, so we're right on the edge right now.	1
ClaimBuster	19596	Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	19597	As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.	1
ClaimBuster	19598	I like PBS, I love Big Bird.	0
ClaimBuster	19599	Let me start with the Pell Grants.	0
ClaimBuster	19600	We're having trouble meeting recruiting goals.	0
ClaimBuster	19601	Now, John's been in the Congress for 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	19602	No, I might as well just go with -- --	0
ClaimBuster	19603	And I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.	0
ClaimBuster	19604	We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border.	1
ClaimBuster	19605	The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists who've looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	19606	So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	19607	Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending.	1
ClaimBuster	19608	I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.	0
ClaimBuster	19609	I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.	0
ClaimBuster	19610	And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	19611	So far, it is only a beginning.	0
ClaimBuster	19612	(LAUGHTER) But for those who have not made up their mind, I would like to conclude by this promise.	0
ClaimBuster	19613	And natural gas isn't just appearing magically.	0
ClaimBuster	19614	We can't settle for anything but the best.	0
ClaimBuster	19615	And I like, I like Senator Dole, you can probably tell we like each other.	0
ClaimBuster	19616	On the other hand, I don't think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	19617	I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret.	1
ClaimBuster	19618	It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.	1
ClaimBuster	19619	I've been critical of the Administration's failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution.	1
ClaimBuster	19620	That is a multi-year project.	1
ClaimBuster	19621	It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.	0
ClaimBuster	19622	So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions.	1
ClaimBuster	19623	That's what we call a sequester.	0
ClaimBuster	19624	Because there is a major problem there.	0
ClaimBuster	19625	That is why President Eisenhower was correct in not apologizing or expressing regrets to Mr. Khrushchev at the Paris Conference, as Senator Kennedy suggested he could have done.	0
ClaimBuster	19626	But the point is that I know how to handle these crises.	0
ClaimBuster	19627	The dollar's gone through the floor.	0
ClaimBuster	19628	And that's one of the reasons why it's in our interest.	0
ClaimBuster	19629	Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult.	0
ClaimBuster	19630	Talk is cheap; words are plentiful, deeds are precious.	0
ClaimBuster	19631	The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.	0
ClaimBuster	19632	On the neutralists' resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened.	1
ClaimBuster	19633	He puts no real assets into the Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	19634	But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	19635	We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.	0
ClaimBuster	19636	Out in the west, yeah.	0
ClaimBuster	19637	I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.	0
ClaimBuster	19638	This administration, by going into the Star Wars system, is going to add a dangerous new escalation.	0
ClaimBuster	19639	I know how these people think.	0
ClaimBuster	19640	Because that's one of the most critical issues here: North Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	19641	Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.	1
ClaimBuster	19642	[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.	0
ClaimBuster	19643	In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives.	0
ClaimBuster	19644	I'm going to rebuild our military power.	0
ClaimBuster	19645	Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?	1
ClaimBuster	19646	We can do better, and we must.	0
ClaimBuster	19647	But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.	0
ClaimBuster	19648	So to answer your question, I would hope we never have to.	0
ClaimBuster	19649	They're stronger now than at any time since 2001.	1
ClaimBuster	19650	We have made sure that they are isolated.	1
ClaimBuster	19651	I noticed recently that Governor Reagan frequently quotes Democratic presidents in his acceptance address.	1
ClaimBuster	19652	I want to cut that business tax.	0
ClaimBuster	19653	You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs.	1
ClaimBuster	19654	And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.	0
ClaimBuster	19655	I'd like to see a balanced budget amendment for America, to protect the American taxpayers, and then that would discipline not only the executive branch but the spending Congress, the Congress that's been in control of one party, his party, for 38 years.	1
ClaimBuster	19656	That's why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can't be sued.	1
ClaimBuster	19657	That's why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America's exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children.	0
ClaimBuster	19658	Now, these are all positions of the ACLU.	0
ClaimBuster	19659	The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs.	1
ClaimBuster	19660	But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.	0
ClaimBuster	19661	And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman.	1
ClaimBuster	19662	Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.	1
ClaimBuster	19663	I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.	0
ClaimBuster	19664	I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	19665	Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.	0
ClaimBuster	19666	I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.	0
ClaimBuster	19667	After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today, the poorest of Americans, six million families, won't pay any tax at all.	1
ClaimBuster	19668	Well, actually, he forgot Poland.	1
ClaimBuster	19669	I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.	1
ClaimBuster	19670	The man who may be developing weapons of mass destruction, we don't know because inspectors aren't in.	1
ClaimBuster	19671	I can't emphasize to you how much.	0
ClaimBuster	19672	I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	19673	But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.	0
ClaimBuster	19674	"But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn't believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote ""political chameleon"" for changing his positions of all times."	1
ClaimBuster	19675	So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women.	1
ClaimBuster	19676	The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around.	1
ClaimBuster	19677	But let me comment on the report.	0
ClaimBuster	19678	No one from Arizona is against solar.	1
ClaimBuster	19679	I've had a strong record of working with Democrats and Republicans in Texas to make sure no child is left behind.	1
ClaimBuster	19680	Our opponents say, things are okay.	0
ClaimBuster	19681	And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.	0
ClaimBuster	19682	Meanwhile, while Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons, some 37 tons of what they called yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uranium, while they're doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb maybe, maybe, to four to seven bombs.	1
ClaimBuster	19683	There's nothing wrong with that.	0
ClaimBuster	19684	It has not been standing still.	0
ClaimBuster	19685	And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class.	1
ClaimBuster	19686	The Mideast is very difficult.	0
ClaimBuster	19687	The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment.	1
ClaimBuster	19688	So what is the answer?	0
ClaimBuster	19689	A 1% increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	19690	They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.	1
ClaimBuster	19691	This is a major problem facing America.	0
ClaimBuster	19692	We have to keep the drugs out of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	19693	I spend a good deal of time talking to young people, and in my standard speech out there on the stump I usually end my speech by saying, I want to ask you for something and I want to direct it especially to the young people in the audience.	1
ClaimBuster	19694	First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when you have $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq, and the president is cutting the COPS program in America?	1
ClaimBuster	19695	So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part.	1
ClaimBuster	19696	And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	19697	I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup.	1
ClaimBuster	19698	We're in an information age when learning is more important than ever.	0
ClaimBuster	19699	That's what we did in Haiti.	1
ClaimBuster	19700	We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	19701	I don't think he'll be reelected because trickle down economics is a failure and he's offering more of it, and what he's saying about my program is just not true.	1
ClaimBuster	19702	And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?	0
ClaimBuster	19703	But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.	1
ClaimBuster	19704	And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.	0
ClaimBuster	19705	It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.	0
ClaimBuster	19706	Well, I would say first of all that Senator's - Kennedy's statement that he's just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn't going to help our prestige either.	0
ClaimBuster	19707	We've gained manufacturing jobs since I've been President.	1
ClaimBuster	19708	And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.	0
ClaimBuster	19709	I've got 5.5 million hard-working people who put me on the ballot, and I belong to them.	1
ClaimBuster	19710	Everyone in this room, practically, here tonight, is an immigrant.	1
ClaimBuster	19711	But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.	0
ClaimBuster	19712	Bob, thank you very much.	0
ClaimBuster	19713	So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?	0
ClaimBuster	19714	Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.	0
ClaimBuster	19715	And this decision you're about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying I'm going to go fix it but what are we going to do?	0
ClaimBuster	19716	He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.	0
ClaimBuster	19717	We have men and women wearing our uniform in substandard housing.	1
ClaimBuster	19718	Let me just say that obviously tonight we're going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do.	0
ClaimBuster	19719	And I've already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money.	0
ClaimBuster	19720	Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there?	1
ClaimBuster	19721	We don't take care of our veterans.	0
ClaimBuster	19722	Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti.	1
ClaimBuster	19723	And since that day, our nation has been on a multi-pronged strategy to keep our country safer.	1
ClaimBuster	19724	Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don't have to just go blue in the face anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	19725	But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	19726	It's not much fun sometimes.	0
ClaimBuster	19727	Three weeks from now -- 2 weeks from tomorrow, America goes to the polls and you're going to have to decide who you want to lead this country to economic recovery.	0
ClaimBuster	19728	We didn't fund a lot of other things this year, like the savings and loan mess.	1
ClaimBuster	19729	But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future.	0
ClaimBuster	19730	I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting our finances, reaching out to the world, again building strong alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	19731	Republican governors as well as Democratic governors.	0
ClaimBuster	19732	We later said no, that's not true.	1
ClaimBuster	19733	I'm for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax.	0
ClaimBuster	19734	This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.	0
ClaimBuster	19735	New world order to me means freedom and democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	19736	You can't -- but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	19737	Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times.	0
ClaimBuster	19738	And I don't believe she does have the stamina.	0
ClaimBuster	19739	I think that would be a very serious mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	19740	... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.	0
ClaimBuster	19741	We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	19742	Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.	1
ClaimBuster	19743	We've got more money going out for local police than any previous administration.	1
ClaimBuster	19744	We are mortgaging our children's future.	0
ClaimBuster	19745	Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes.	0
ClaimBuster	19746	Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	19747	I'm meeting folks all over the country.	1
ClaimBuster	19748	And we talk about evidence.	0
ClaimBuster	19749	Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process.	1
ClaimBuster	19750	For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets.	1
ClaimBuster	19751	The removal of Russian troops from the Baltics.	0
ClaimBuster	19752	And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President.	0
ClaimBuster	19753	And then let's take the last one, championing small business.	0
ClaimBuster	19754	And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it.	0
ClaimBuster	19755	Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.	0
ClaimBuster	19756	Senator Obama had the opening.	0
ClaimBuster	19757	How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what we've done, in that way?	0
ClaimBuster	19758	And that's where our society must head if we're going to be a peaceful and prosperous society.	0
ClaimBuster	19759	I see people in my state, middle class people -- their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	19760	We've got fundamental problems in the system.	1
ClaimBuster	19761	That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption - money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn't have to spend.	1
ClaimBuster	19762	And the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities.	1
ClaimBuster	19763	And so what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.	0
ClaimBuster	19764	This is a movement that came from the people.	1
ClaimBuster	19765	I'd like to start by telling you what my vision is.	0
ClaimBuster	19766	And believe me, if you knew my family and if you knew the private life I have, you would agree in a minute that that's a whole lot more fun than getting involved in politics.	0
ClaimBuster	19767	I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.	0
ClaimBuster	19768	I agree with that, John.	0
ClaimBuster	19769	I want to remind you that it wasn't just my administration that made the decision on safety.	1
ClaimBuster	19770	We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	19771	So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.	1
ClaimBuster	19772	I don't want to cut our commitment to education.	0
ClaimBuster	19773	I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	19774	We've got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.	1
ClaimBuster	19775	Now, whether it's character or judgment -- whatever it is -- I have a big difference here on this issue and so we'll just have to see how it plays out.	0
ClaimBuster	19776	It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford.	1
ClaimBuster	19777	And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	19778	But going back to Libya -- because this is an example of how we make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	19779	We end up being problem solvers.	0
ClaimBuster	19780	Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with.	1
ClaimBuster	19781	And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.	0
ClaimBuster	19782	That's why we opposed the government take over health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	19783	You could knock out the tax increases and you could do what the people want, and that's create enterprise zones.	0
ClaimBuster	19784	And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	19785	Tell Silvio Berlusconi we're going alone.	0
ClaimBuster	19786	So here's what my plan does.	0
ClaimBuster	19787	He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	19788	At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax.	1
ClaimBuster	19789	I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield.	1
ClaimBuster	19790	That's one of the major differences we have about defending our country.	0
ClaimBuster	19791	And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, they've never been carried out.	0
ClaimBuster	19792	But, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place.	0
ClaimBuster	19793	It was about emergencies, wasn't it?	0
ClaimBuster	19794	Finally, if we don't fix this, you're right.	0
ClaimBuster	19795	That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act.	1
ClaimBuster	19796	Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it.	0
ClaimBuster	19797	You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	19798	Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.	1
ClaimBuster	19799	Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated.	1
ClaimBuster	19800	And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.	0
ClaimBuster	19801	And recently when he was asked specifically about Iraq, he said there is nothing we can do about it.	1
ClaimBuster	19802	We need to indict Ahmadinejad.	0
ClaimBuster	19803	Israel is our friend and we'll stand by Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	19804	We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.	0
ClaimBuster	19805	I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.	0
ClaimBuster	19806	Those are the fuzzy math figures put together by some group that works for the campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	19807	You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.	1
ClaimBuster	19808	There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	19809	And today it's less than 1 percent, because we're working together to try to bring this deficit under control.	1
ClaimBuster	19810	And that's the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.	0
ClaimBuster	19811	So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit.	0
ClaimBuster	19812	I believe in the balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	19813	I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	19814	In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.	0
ClaimBuster	19815	They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.	1
ClaimBuster	19816	We have -- our military, the morale is high.	0
ClaimBuster	19817	We've gone through a Great Depression in our lifetime that literally was worldwide and almost brought us to our knees.	1
ClaimBuster	19818	If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.	0
ClaimBuster	19819	And Iraq is going to be free, and America will be better off for it.	0
ClaimBuster	19820	And I think what I don't know is what all of us don't know, and that's what's going to happen both here at home and abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	19821	I see it as a question of values.	0
ClaimBuster	19822	The people need to take their government back.	0
ClaimBuster	19823	I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.	0
ClaimBuster	19824	And there are ways of doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	19825	She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.	1
ClaimBuster	19826	People don't dare -- medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they're afraid that some lawyer's going to come along and get a big lawsuit.	0
ClaimBuster	19827	Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- there's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.	1
ClaimBuster	19828	In California, we made 37 billion dollars' worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for export for the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	19829	Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	19830	I think it's a very clear contrast.	0
ClaimBuster	19831	And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it.	1
ClaimBuster	19832	This is a family tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	19833	The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.	0
ClaimBuster	19834	Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.	0
ClaimBuster	19835	She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.	0
ClaimBuster	19836	There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.	0
ClaimBuster	19837	I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America.	1
ClaimBuster	19838	When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster.	0
ClaimBuster	19839	I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?	0
ClaimBuster	19840	Uh - earlier, uh - Mr. Levi, his uh - attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh - so-called Saturday Night Specials.	1
ClaimBuster	19841	As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations.	0
ClaimBuster	19842	I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.	0
ClaimBuster	19843	I want to keep their taxes down on small business.	0
ClaimBuster	19844	It was personal e-mails, not official.	1
ClaimBuster	19845	I don't even have a seal yet.	1
ClaimBuster	19846	So I have a record.	1
ClaimBuster	19847	One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we'd have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece.	1
ClaimBuster	19848	That's all behind us now, and it should be behind us, and the forgotten war, the Korean War, but I guess I can just answer you very plainly, Jason.	0
ClaimBuster	19849	We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East: It is to support the peace process; to support the security of Israel; and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace.	1
ClaimBuster	19850	He won't tell you because he can't.	0
ClaimBuster	19851	I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	19852	Let's not raise taxes on anybody today.	0
ClaimBuster	19853	And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time.	1
ClaimBuster	19854	Your own Council of Economic Advisers -- Mr. Feldstein in his report told you that.	1
ClaimBuster	19855	I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	19856	It's impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can't anticipate what's gonna happen next.	0
ClaimBuster	19857	Freedom is on the march.	0
ClaimBuster	19858	I know these folks and I know their families.	1
ClaimBuster	19859	Well, he mentioned the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	19860	Well, there's a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it.	0
ClaimBuster	19861	And we need to reverse that.	0
ClaimBuster	19862	You've got to do that; we got to get those costs down.	0
ClaimBuster	19863	I'm pledging I will not raise taxes; I'm giving a tax cut to the people earning less than $200,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	19864	I -- listen, I -- we've got a great country.	0
ClaimBuster	19865	Miss Quinn, I don't have to.	0
ClaimBuster	19866	But nobody was caring much about it.	0
ClaimBuster	19867	We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case.	1
ClaimBuster	19868	She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.	0
ClaimBuster	19869	Now, if these aren't special interests, I've got a lot to learn.	0
ClaimBuster	19870	The captains are leaving the service.	1
ClaimBuster	19871	I remember when Ronald Reagan was the president; he stood on principle.	0
ClaimBuster	19872	First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system?	0
ClaimBuster	19873	I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy, I think, doesn't make sense.	0
ClaimBuster	19874	I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.	1
ClaimBuster	19875	Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.	0
ClaimBuster	19876	Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.	1
ClaimBuster	19877	I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator.	0
ClaimBuster	19878	We have to also stand by our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	19879	There's no certain road to the presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	19880	He suggested we pass an aid to education bill.	1
ClaimBuster	19881	The quality of the air's cleaner since I've been the president.	1
ClaimBuster	19882	We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways -- $150 billion for improving the infrastructure.	1
ClaimBuster	19883	Well, Prime Minister Allawi was here.	1
ClaimBuster	19884	When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh - just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them.	0
ClaimBuster	19885	I disagree with the vice president on this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	19886	These are families that get hurt.	0
ClaimBuster	19887	Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.	1
ClaimBuster	19888	I've been in them all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	19889	And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.	0
ClaimBuster	19890	Also as far as religion is concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	19891	It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.	0
ClaimBuster	19892	What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	19893	And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.	0
ClaimBuster	19894	And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	19895	Now he's having to say that again.	1
ClaimBuster	19896	And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic.	1
ClaimBuster	19897	I wasn't just getting more power and more power.	0
ClaimBuster	19898	And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats.	0
ClaimBuster	19899	So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess.	0
ClaimBuster	19900	But we're so, turned so inward we don't understand the global picture.	0
ClaimBuster	19901	That's what we've been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe.	1
ClaimBuster	19902	There is not a simple answer.	0
ClaimBuster	19903	There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals.	0
ClaimBuster	19904	We need to have more second chance programs.	0
ClaimBuster	19905	I've heard them explain - try to explain - how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can't go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola.	1
ClaimBuster	19906	We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.	1
ClaimBuster	19907	We do so in my state of Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	19908	Now, you didn't hear any plan from the president, because he doesn't have a plan to lower the cost of health care.	1
ClaimBuster	19909	We need to move in a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	19910	I will get us on track to a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	19911	And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power.	0
ClaimBuster	19912	50 million Americans get no tax relief under his plan.	1
ClaimBuster	19913	Five million people have lost their health insurance under this president.	1
ClaimBuster	19914	But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system.	0
ClaimBuster	19915	It's a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	19916	He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso.	0
ClaimBuster	19917	Is the Middle East in tumult?	0
ClaimBuster	19918	It'd be fine with me.	0
ClaimBuster	19919	So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.	1
ClaimBuster	19920	I've been working on this for a long, long time.	1
ClaimBuster	19921	"Here's what we'' -- give them a demonstration and then say -- ""Here's what we can do."	0
ClaimBuster	19922	But I can't take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn't share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever.	0
ClaimBuster	19923	The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	19924	In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.	0
ClaimBuster	19925	Everybody's running against the incumbent.	1
ClaimBuster	19926	My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century.	1
ClaimBuster	19927	I'm afraid I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua.	0
ClaimBuster	19928	And we did get their attention.	0
ClaimBuster	19929	Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.	0
ClaimBuster	19930	Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence.	0
ClaimBuster	19931	And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	19932	All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Senator Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.	0
ClaimBuster	19933	That's the difference between us.	1
ClaimBuster	19934	For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	19935	There's a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future.	1
ClaimBuster	19936	You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman.	0
ClaimBuster	19937	And everyone of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all of them were saying pass enterprise zones.	0
ClaimBuster	19938	I want to make sure the public school system in America keeps its promise so not one child is left behind.	0
ClaimBuster	19939	And what kind of small business do you have?	0
ClaimBuster	19940	The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	19941	That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.	0
ClaimBuster	19942	Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.	0
ClaimBuster	19943	And so, in our seven years, we find that we have been firm in our diplomacy; we have never made concessions without getting concessions in return.	1
ClaimBuster	19944	But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman.	0
ClaimBuster	19945	I think I should respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	19946	I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	19947	But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?	0
ClaimBuster	19948	I have been accused lately of having a secret plan with regard to the hostages.	1
ClaimBuster	19949	Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program.	0
ClaimBuster	19950	We're going into the next century a better America.	0
ClaimBuster	19951	But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	19952	I favor higher salaries for teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	19953	And -- and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.	0
ClaimBuster	19954	And -- and we've got to deal with cost.	0
ClaimBuster	19955	But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	19956	And what I've also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents.	0
ClaimBuster	19957	And, Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked.	1
ClaimBuster	19958	I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society.	0
ClaimBuster	19959	She's been talking about it for years.	1
ClaimBuster	19960	And you're going to stop them?	0
ClaimBuster	19961	It encouraged them to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	19962	And it did and we will win this one and we won't come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail.	0
ClaimBuster	19963	You know what it is?	0
ClaimBuster	19964	And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.	0
ClaimBuster	19965	So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.	1
ClaimBuster	19966	I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president.	0
ClaimBuster	19967	I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi.	1
ClaimBuster	19968	Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born.	1
ClaimBuster	19969	We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	19970	... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.	1
ClaimBuster	19971	There's been no change in my attitude at all.	1
ClaimBuster	19972	If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.	0
ClaimBuster	19973	Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?	0
ClaimBuster	19974	I'll look at it at the time.	0
ClaimBuster	19975	Well what you're seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job.	1
ClaimBuster	19976	I'm going to keep my word to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	19977	I'm against removing dams in the northwest.	0
ClaimBuster	19978	One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.	1
ClaimBuster	19979	More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.	1
ClaimBuster	19980	I think the business community wants to get involved.	0
ClaimBuster	19981	I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.	0
ClaimBuster	19982	He said it was in the public interest at the time and most everybody who was involved in it, I guess, thought it was.	1
ClaimBuster	19983	Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected.	1
ClaimBuster	19984	Because you'd be in jail.	0
ClaimBuster	19985	And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.	1
ClaimBuster	19986	As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear.	0
ClaimBuster	19987	This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.	0
ClaimBuster	19988	Certainly the President of the United States, the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	19989	That answer almost made me want to scowl.	0
ClaimBuster	19990	And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level.	0
ClaimBuster	19991	I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.	1
ClaimBuster	19992	But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	19993	I find that just absolutely...	0
ClaimBuster	19994	Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.	0
ClaimBuster	19995	But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just won't teach and won't change.	0
ClaimBuster	19996	And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea.	0
ClaimBuster	19997	Because the Congress failed to act, I am going to announce tomorrow that the Department of Commerce will disclose those companies that have uh - participated in the Arab boycott.	0
ClaimBuster	19998	I think they're better off, all of us are, that we got the interest rates down and the deficit down.	1
ClaimBuster	19999	But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.	0
ClaimBuster	20000	I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, we're maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all - the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	20001	We've got agreements, but they are still there.	0
ClaimBuster	20002	Well, you talk about walking a waffle line -- he says he's allowed it, which means he's going to allow the destruction of life up to a certain amount and then he isn't going to allow it.	0
ClaimBuster	20003	The president takes credit for all these people off welfare.	0
ClaimBuster	20004	We are back on the right track.	0
ClaimBuster	20005	The program that the president -- two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch.	0
ClaimBuster	20006	That was done with much thought and deliberation.	0
ClaimBuster	20007	Mr. President, you're batting 0 for 2.	0
ClaimBuster	20008	In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	20009	It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	20010	I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	20011	Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive.	0
ClaimBuster	20012	I just want to make this point, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	20013	It's now the largest peacetime government ever in terms of the take from the total economy.	1
ClaimBuster	20014	We just see the world in different ways.	0
ClaimBuster	20015	And how to get them passed?	0
ClaimBuster	20016	I think you'll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.	0
ClaimBuster	20017	Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	20018	Children whose parents wouldn't speak English as a first language just move through.	0
ClaimBuster	20019	And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire.	0
ClaimBuster	20020	My opponent talks about fiscal sanity.	1
ClaimBuster	20021	A president's job is to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	20022	And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.	0
ClaimBuster	20023	Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	20024	That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment.	0
ClaimBuster	20025	The fact is I've picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	20026	I hope they talked and I hope they've reached some result and that the killing will end.	0
ClaimBuster	20027	We believe in tough love.	0
ClaimBuster	20028	But I can tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	20029	She's cut the size of government.	1
ClaimBuster	20030	Third, what's really hurting American business more than anything else is the cost of health care.	0
ClaimBuster	20031	We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results.	0
ClaimBuster	20032	And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.	0
ClaimBuster	20033	And so what we did was take away those leases.	0
ClaimBuster	20034	What Mr. Gore's plan will do causing huge payroll taxes or major benefit reductions.	0
ClaimBuster	20035	Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	20036	Till they're destroyed, some crazy person can either sell them or use them.	0
ClaimBuster	20037	If you confiscate the Forbes 400 wealth, take it all, you cannot balance the budget this year.	1
ClaimBuster	20038	I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage.	0
ClaimBuster	20039	A lot of good people have lost jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	20040	If you give me four years more I will work on it some more and I will try to answer these charges, but I prefer to emphasize direct answers to the future and I gave you a direct answer.	0
ClaimBuster	20041	I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	20042	This election is about big things.	0
ClaimBuster	20043	Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	20044	This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.	0
ClaimBuster	20045	Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did.	0
ClaimBuster	20046	So we need more protection from America.	0
ClaimBuster	20047	We uh - now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh - by giving uh - the lowest rates to the biggest users.	1
ClaimBuster	20048	We - quite often we have a transient problem.	0
ClaimBuster	20049	I understand what it's like to send young American's in harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	20050	After 9/11, after the recession had ended, the president asked for another tax cut and promised 5.6 million jobs would be created.	1
ClaimBuster	20051	But we did something else that was interesting.	0
ClaimBuster	20052	Senator Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history -- in history.	1
ClaimBuster	20053	... but -- but -- but overall.	0
ClaimBuster	20054	In terms of Darfur, I agree it's genocide.	0
ClaimBuster	20055	... before the invasion, he supported it.	1
ClaimBuster	20056	We've lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	20057	So I welcome that challenge, and just watch --	0
ClaimBuster	20058	That's my vision for public education all around America.	0
ClaimBuster	20059	And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.	1
ClaimBuster	20060	And he is supporting me 100 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	20061	But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member.	0
ClaimBuster	20062	And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	20063	When I make a mistake I'll admit it.	0
ClaimBuster	20064	Social Security is not that tough.	0
ClaimBuster	20065	But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	20066	The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns.	1
ClaimBuster	20067	Traditionally, if you've been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote.	0
ClaimBuster	20068	We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	20069	And so I'll just be asking for support to get that put into effect.	0
ClaimBuster	20070	Ten thousand out of 12,000 Humvees aren't armored.	1
ClaimBuster	20071	And that was rejected, and that's why I voted present, because I'm willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.	1
ClaimBuster	20072	I have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas?	0
ClaimBuster	20073	But I have a difference with this president.	0
ClaimBuster	20074	Look, we're in an information age.	0
ClaimBuster	20075	There was a momentary fear that he might win and that the markets went phwee, down like that.	0
ClaimBuster	20076	And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil.	0
ClaimBuster	20077	My five-point plan does it.	0
ClaimBuster	20078	I don't; I believe in free and fair trade, and that's the thing that saved us.	0
ClaimBuster	20079	I'd like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	20080	My opponent voted against the ban.	1
ClaimBuster	20081	Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...	0
ClaimBuster	20082	I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?	0
ClaimBuster	20083	Now, this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press, when I am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there?	0
ClaimBuster	20084	First you've got to have money to pay for these things.	0
ClaimBuster	20085	This is how Donald thinks.	0
ClaimBuster	20086	And just remember this, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	20087	They've had a chance to form consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	20088	As president I have to be sure that those waivers, which we're approving all over the place, are covered under the law.	1
ClaimBuster	20089	We're going to pull the country together.	0
ClaimBuster	20090	We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	20091	I'm very familiar with it.	0
ClaimBuster	20092	Let's get back to Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	20093	But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.	0
ClaimBuster	20094	And I really believe that it - it's far better for us and for the Soviet Union, and more importantly for the people around the world, that these two superpowers find an answer for a SALT II agreement before October three, 1977.	0
ClaimBuster	20095	You talked about it last time, you talked about a risky scheme and Vice President Gore repeated it about ten times in St. Petersburg.	1
ClaimBuster	20096	If the president were to be reelected you're going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	20097	We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.	0
ClaimBuster	20098	And that's why I've proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether it's military service, whether it's Peace Corps, whether it's working in a community.	1
ClaimBuster	20099	I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia.	0
ClaimBuster	20100	I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else.	0
ClaimBuster	20101	And the United States needs help from other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	20102	No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does.	1
ClaimBuster	20103	I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.	1
ClaimBuster	20104	And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	20105	I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can.	0
ClaimBuster	20106	I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength.	0
ClaimBuster	20107	Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that I have worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a five year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not earlier, and that we can afford - along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government.	0
ClaimBuster	20108	I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions.	1
ClaimBuster	20109	And I made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	20110	And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers.	0
ClaimBuster	20111	It is a question of which administration does the right thing.	0
ClaimBuster	20112	All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later.	0
ClaimBuster	20113	If I'm entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make.	0
ClaimBuster	20114	Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	20115	I want people to hear what he just said.	0
ClaimBuster	20116	They'll have at least two plans.	1
ClaimBuster	20117	I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.	0
ClaimBuster	20118	... because it's an important part of the American experience.	0
ClaimBuster	20119	And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.	0
ClaimBuster	20120	They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market.	0
ClaimBuster	20121	My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports.	1
ClaimBuster	20122	Because they could go back worse than things used to be.	0
ClaimBuster	20123	We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	20124	Again, I'd say if they asked us to play some reasonable role, I don't know how I would respond.	0
ClaimBuster	20125	I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	20126	I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have them.	0
ClaimBuster	20127	And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.	1
ClaimBuster	20128	We don't have to live like this.	0
ClaimBuster	20129	We've created five million jobs, and gone from 800 jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress.	1
ClaimBuster	20130	Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up.	0
ClaimBuster	20131	We can lift our schools up.	0
ClaimBuster	20132	We can't dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady.	0
ClaimBuster	20133	We'd have won what Bill Clinton won.	0
ClaimBuster	20134	My plan is Social Security plus.	0
ClaimBuster	20135	Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.	0
ClaimBuster	20136	And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.	0
ClaimBuster	20137	But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination.	0
ClaimBuster	20138	Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.	0
ClaimBuster	20139	John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.	1
ClaimBuster	20140	Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.	1
ClaimBuster	20141	We should make sure our legal system works.	0
ClaimBuster	20142	I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	20143	She said, I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night.	1
ClaimBuster	20144	Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won't take a position on that.	0
ClaimBuster	20145	So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let's start the National Academy of Sciences, let's start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off.	1
ClaimBuster	20146	So, you talk about friend?	0
ClaimBuster	20147	I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.	1
ClaimBuster	20148	We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.	0
ClaimBuster	20149	He been a senator for 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	20150	It's an agenda that says we're going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose.	1
ClaimBuster	20151	And I think it's important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people.	0
ClaimBuster	20152	It's to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	20153	And you could never quite get the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	20154	And I'm a big fan of NATO.	0
ClaimBuster	20155	If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?	0
ClaimBuster	20156	I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.	0
ClaimBuster	20157	But there are a lot of procedures that haven't kept up in Medicare with the current times.	1
ClaimBuster	20158	But that's what the election's about.	0
ClaimBuster	20159	We have people that want to fight both at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	20160	It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.	1
ClaimBuster	20161	Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets.	1
ClaimBuster	20162	And they're going to end up getting nuclear.	0
ClaimBuster	20163	You can't do that and expect to win the war on terror.	0
ClaimBuster	20164	They have a VAT tax.	1
ClaimBuster	20165	And when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it.	0
ClaimBuster	20166	Now, we've got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	20167	That's why we're going to have to go out into the housing market and we're going to have to buy up these bad loans and we're going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home.	0
ClaimBuster	20168	I don't have any criticism of Mr. Perot.	0
ClaimBuster	20169	Let's take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	20170	That's why I think it's important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning.	0
ClaimBuster	20171	These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they've hurt kids all over this country.	1
ClaimBuster	20172	Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years I've been on the National Security Council.	1
ClaimBuster	20173	Look, we need the highest possible ethical standards.	0
ClaimBuster	20174	And I want to thank the University of Denver.	0
ClaimBuster	20175	And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	20176	Let's not, let's help, let's turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association.	0
ClaimBuster	20177	I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia.	0
ClaimBuster	20178	Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives.	0
ClaimBuster	20179	And we're still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we don't have a national economic strategy that will build the industrial base of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	20180	Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20181	Will we ever be safe and secure again?	0
ClaimBuster	20182	Senator McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices.	0
ClaimBuster	20183	They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	20184	And we're making progress there.	1
ClaimBuster	20185	But our real power comes, I think, from our values.	0
ClaimBuster	20186	Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldn't legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad.	0
ClaimBuster	20187	And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCain's own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.	0
ClaimBuster	20188	But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared.	1
ClaimBuster	20189	I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.	1
ClaimBuster	20190	But we now have an economy that, for the first time -- well, let's put it this way: In the first half of 1980, gross national product was down a minus 3.7 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	20191	Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	20192	I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.	0
ClaimBuster	20193	Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.	0
ClaimBuster	20194	That's what I intend to do.	0
ClaimBuster	20195	But all the committees, the attorney general, the special prosecutor, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.	1
ClaimBuster	20196	And the thing I find is if I make a mistake, I admit it.	0
ClaimBuster	20197	I don't want anybody to stampede to cut the president's salary off altogether.	0
ClaimBuster	20198	That's how we built the world's greatest middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	20199	So it is a priority for me.	0
ClaimBuster	20200	And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...	1
ClaimBuster	20201	And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut -- we're supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand -- but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.	1
ClaimBuster	20202	They're the best, the best ever at it.	0
ClaimBuster	20203	My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.	0
ClaimBuster	20204	They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the tension...	1
ClaimBuster	20205	That's really part of your mistrust here.	0
ClaimBuster	20206	So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	20207	My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.	1
ClaimBuster	20208	I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less.	1
ClaimBuster	20209	"We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, ""We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" and we say, ""No, you're not""?"	1
ClaimBuster	20210	Well, I thank you for that question, because there's no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	20211	We don't have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job.	1
ClaimBuster	20212	But I do say a majority are.	1
ClaimBuster	20213	I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	20214	One thing I would like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole said.	0
ClaimBuster	20215	But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.	0
ClaimBuster	20216	"And I'll tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, ""Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my son's name on it."""	1
ClaimBuster	20217	Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist.	0
ClaimBuster	20218	I have a plan -- not a secret plan.	0
ClaimBuster	20219	The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country - $65 billion - primarily because our people are not at work.	1
ClaimBuster	20220	We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border.	1
ClaimBuster	20221	That is where I think the future of the world lies.	0
ClaimBuster	20222	I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives; to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so we're all working together.	0
ClaimBuster	20223	Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here.	0
ClaimBuster	20224	To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country.	0
ClaimBuster	20225	You guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.	0
ClaimBuster	20226	They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists.	0
ClaimBuster	20227	But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.	1
ClaimBuster	20228	I don't have a dog in this fight, but I'd like to get in on this.	0
ClaimBuster	20229	There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear I'll trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that they'll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	20230	Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.	1
ClaimBuster	20231	I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	20232	We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins.	1
ClaimBuster	20233	In fact, we put together a $5.6 trillion surplus in the '90s that was for the purpose of saving Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	20234	But large businesses that can afford it, we've got a choice.	0
ClaimBuster	20235	All these things take a few minutes.	0
ClaimBuster	20236	And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this - change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors - the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors - to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable.	0
ClaimBuster	20237	And I think it's very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state.	0
ClaimBuster	20238	This is an issue that will require a new attitude.	0
ClaimBuster	20239	Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job.	0
ClaimBuster	20240	I'll continue, in the four years, to continue to try to work to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	20241	It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	20242	And frankly, now we're going to do it right.	0
ClaimBuster	20243	That's math that doesn't add up.	0
ClaimBuster	20244	And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.	0
ClaimBuster	20245	In the meantime, I'm going to continue praying that they'll carne home.	0
ClaimBuster	20246	Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.	0
ClaimBuster	20247	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.	0
ClaimBuster	20248	And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top.	1
ClaimBuster	20249	So the point is --	0
ClaimBuster	20250	I understand how hard it is to start a small business.	0
ClaimBuster	20251	But it's not getting out because there are too few debates.	0
ClaimBuster	20252	There is an abundant supply of coal in America.	1
ClaimBuster	20253	An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them.	0
ClaimBuster	20254	Ross had his hand up.	1
ClaimBuster	20255	We're a serious debtor nation.	1
ClaimBuster	20256	Every time there's been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them.	1
ClaimBuster	20257	It is because we have not grown.	0
ClaimBuster	20258	And I can prove it.	0
ClaimBuster	20259	In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats -- broke with my party.	1
ClaimBuster	20260	And secondly, it's a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	20261	But I'm not going to make any excuses.	0
ClaimBuster	20262	That they're appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred.	0
ClaimBuster	20263	I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also.	0
ClaimBuster	20264	Now then, to nail it, there's one way out -- a growing, expanding job base.	0
ClaimBuster	20265	Now, the thing I love about it -- I'm just a businessman.	0
ClaimBuster	20266	Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation.	0
ClaimBuster	20267	Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it?	0
ClaimBuster	20268	You mentioned the Heller decision.	1
ClaimBuster	20269	But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.	0
ClaimBuster	20270	But I'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	20271	I made a good selection.	0
ClaimBuster	20272	We have to get a handle on it.	0
ClaimBuster	20273	I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.	1
ClaimBuster	20274	But a president must always be willing to use troops.	0
ClaimBuster	20275	The other called it untrue.	1
ClaimBuster	20276	You know, going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn't a fundraiser isn't my view of responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	20277	I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.	0
ClaimBuster	20278	Yes, there are big problems, and yes, people are hurting.	0
ClaimBuster	20279	Can I say just one other thing here?	0
ClaimBuster	20280	I'm going to stop other things.	0
ClaimBuster	20281	I hope we can talk more about that.	0
ClaimBuster	20282	That's why we have to balance the budget, and I will tell you how I'm going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line.	0
ClaimBuster	20283	You can't talk about it rationally.	0
ClaimBuster	20284	That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.	1
ClaimBuster	20285	Next Tuesday is Election Day.	1
ClaimBuster	20286	I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	20287	We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	20288	We don't know whether it's going to work or not, but we keep giving the incentives.	0
ClaimBuster	20289	Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''	0
ClaimBuster	20290	We didn't guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction.	1
ClaimBuster	20291	If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations.	0
ClaimBuster	20292	Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.	1
ClaimBuster	20293	Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.	0
ClaimBuster	20294	He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now.	1
ClaimBuster	20295	I√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢m on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans.	0
ClaimBuster	20296	"One vote doesn't make a difference."""	0
ClaimBuster	20297	I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.	0
ClaimBuster	20298	We have got to unite and pull together, and there's nothing we can't do.	0
ClaimBuster	20299	I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	20300	You looked at me like my clock was up.	0
ClaimBuster	20301	It's making the country poorer, which is why I answered the gentleman the way I did before.	0
ClaimBuster	20302	I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	20303	It's going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	20304	We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.	1
ClaimBuster	20305	But I am familiar with the statement, and it was made by one of the top-ranking officials of that organization.	1
ClaimBuster	20306	That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	20307	I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else.	1
ClaimBuster	20308	We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.	0
ClaimBuster	20309	And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	20310	We would have had the U.N. inspectors.	0
ClaimBuster	20311	And he will do very very well.	0
ClaimBuster	20312	I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.	1
ClaimBuster	20313	But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I don't know, you know, how credible that is.	1
ClaimBuster	20314	Here's what I'll do: Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11.	1
ClaimBuster	20315	It's called bait and switch.	0
ClaimBuster	20316	Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	20317	The Vice President and I disagree on this.	1
ClaimBuster	20318	Can they rely on us?	0
ClaimBuster	20319	Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence.	1
ClaimBuster	20320	You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror.	1
ClaimBuster	20321	We need to do more and better.	0
ClaimBuster	20322	He has raised taxes several times.	1
ClaimBuster	20323	Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.	1
ClaimBuster	20324	He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.	0
ClaimBuster	20325	I think you ought to get the break.	0
ClaimBuster	20326	Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that?	0
ClaimBuster	20327	The technology is there and we have to drill now.	0
ClaimBuster	20328	And if not, I'll get rid of it.	0
ClaimBuster	20329	Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but it's making our businesses less competitive.	1
ClaimBuster	20330	We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	20331	That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me.	0
ClaimBuster	20332	And we've won just about every case that we've filed, that has been decided.	0
ClaimBuster	20333	It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.	0
ClaimBuster	20334	But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	20335	Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	20336	It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	20337	I come from the school of thought that says when people have more money in their pocket during economic times, it increases demand or investment.	0
ClaimBuster	20338	And I'm glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins.	0
ClaimBuster	20339	And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.	0
ClaimBuster	20340	Now they have to try harder if they want to keep getting federal funds.	0
ClaimBuster	20341	By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster.	1
ClaimBuster	20342	Robin, I'm going to answer your question.	0
ClaimBuster	20343	He introduced some 300 bills and he's passed five.	1
ClaimBuster	20344	And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation.	0
ClaimBuster	20345	I know something about prosecuting.	0
ClaimBuster	20346	Now, what can we do?	0
ClaimBuster	20347	I've had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	20348	Senator McCain's absolutely right: The D.C. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time.	0
ClaimBuster	20349	We turn it over to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	20350	They can take it anywhere, across state lines.	0
ClaimBuster	20351	Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	20352	His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.	1
ClaimBuster	20353	He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for.	1
ClaimBuster	20354	That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.	1
ClaimBuster	20355	Nobody is even talking about that.	0
ClaimBuster	20356	Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been.	0
ClaimBuster	20357	We ought to say this is good.	0
ClaimBuster	20358	Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer.	0
ClaimBuster	20359	And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.	0
ClaimBuster	20360	To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	20361	"I think that's a good idea"" -- four years ago."	0
ClaimBuster	20362	So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	20363	But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes.	0
ClaimBuster	20364	And that's the economic package again.	0
ClaimBuster	20365	Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed.	1
ClaimBuster	20366	Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?	1
ClaimBuster	20367	And I vowed something because I learned something from Vietnam.	0
ClaimBuster	20368	Until we control health care costs, we're not going to control the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	20369	We would have had sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	20370	And why I think it is outrageous -- first of all, it isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	20371	Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.	0
ClaimBuster	20372	So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	20373	Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it.	1
ClaimBuster	20374	This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.	0
ClaimBuster	20375	Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores.	1
ClaimBuster	20376	So, I think some of those charges are missing the point.	0
ClaimBuster	20377	Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.	0
ClaimBuster	20378	And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.	1
ClaimBuster	20379	So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote, I also understand -- I want to open up markets, but I also understand that farming is a part of our national security.	0
ClaimBuster	20380	Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families?	0
ClaimBuster	20381	I've got a good relation with Vladimir.	0
ClaimBuster	20382	But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check.	0
ClaimBuster	20383	We ought to make one last effort.	0
ClaimBuster	20384	And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes.	0
ClaimBuster	20385	Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.	0
ClaimBuster	20386	I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is.	0
ClaimBuster	20387	We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.	1
ClaimBuster	20388	If you don't agree -- leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us don't leave with anything else, I hope you will leave with this.	0
ClaimBuster	20389	As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they've missed the mark by nearly $600 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	20390	We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us.	0
ClaimBuster	20391	This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.	0
ClaimBuster	20392	As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.	0
ClaimBuster	20393	Saddam Hussein didn't attack us.	1
ClaimBuster	20394	The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.	0
ClaimBuster	20395	And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	20396	Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks?	1
ClaimBuster	20397	"At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can ""muddle through"" Afghanistan."	1
ClaimBuster	20398	We set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers, not by the government.	1
ClaimBuster	20399	And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations.	0
ClaimBuster	20400	This needs to be changed.	0
ClaimBuster	20401	A senator runs every 6 years.	1
ClaimBuster	20402	You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me.	1
ClaimBuster	20403	You can't change the dynamics on the ground if you've criticized the brave leader of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	20404	And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	20405	Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote.	1
ClaimBuster	20406	The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue.	0
ClaimBuster	20407	That's what leadership is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	20408	Thank you, Jim, very much.	0
ClaimBuster	20409	They concluded that my plan would cover everybody and his would leave 27 million behind by the year 2000 and that my plan in the next 12 years would save $2.2 trillion in public and private money to reinvest in this economy and the average family would save $1200 a year under the plan that I offered without any erosion in the quality of health care	1
ClaimBuster	20410	I referred to the Dingle-Norwood bill.	1
ClaimBuster	20411	I don't think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002.	1
ClaimBuster	20412	Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?	0
ClaimBuster	20413	But I think it's important just to remember a little bit of history.	0
ClaimBuster	20414	When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	20415	We have to respect one another.	0
ClaimBuster	20416	Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand.	0
ClaimBuster	20417	You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank.	0
ClaimBuster	20418	And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.	0
ClaimBuster	20419	And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.	1
ClaimBuster	20420	I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times.	1
ClaimBuster	20421	I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job.	0
ClaimBuster	20422	I have fought against it.	1
ClaimBuster	20423	I'll give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	20424	They have to abide by their treaty with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	20425	I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.	0
ClaimBuster	20426	But the Russians, I think we can deal with them but they've got to understand that they're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20427	So you get a pretty good sense of where he's heading if he were to appoint somebody.	0
ClaimBuster	20428	And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat.	1
ClaimBuster	20429	We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	20430	Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run.	0
ClaimBuster	20431	And it seems to me what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use between 12- and 17-year-olds has doubled in this administration in the last 44 months.	1
ClaimBuster	20432	The point is -- the point is that we can fix our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	20433	And in order to have the best intelligence in the world to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what they're plotting, you've got to have the best cooperation you've ever had in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20434	A lot of them are mentally sick.	0
ClaimBuster	20435	You know, I was in New Hampshire.	1
ClaimBuster	20436	And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.	1
ClaimBuster	20437	The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.	1
ClaimBuster	20438	When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.	1
ClaimBuster	20439	No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.	0
ClaimBuster	20440	Now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force.	0
ClaimBuster	20441	Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.	0
ClaimBuster	20442	It's not a government plan.	1
ClaimBuster	20443	I will have an ethical office in the White House that will be under the President's personal concern.	0
ClaimBuster	20444	Kitty and I are very grateful to all of you for the warmth and the hospitality that you've given to us in your homes and communities all across this country.	0
ClaimBuster	20445	We happen to have a statute on the books that's a hate crimes statute in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	20446	And there was a terrible reaction internationally to Mr. Bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle-down economics--another across-the- board tax cut and most of it going to the wealthy, with no real guarantee of investment.	1
ClaimBuster	20447	And I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there because these are my folks, and I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home.	0
ClaimBuster	20448	Well, there's a law pending called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.	1
ClaimBuster	20449	I will say again: you cannot control health care costs simply by cutting Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	20450	I am not for national registration of firearms.	1
ClaimBuster	20451	But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.	0
ClaimBuster	20452	That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.	1
ClaimBuster	20453	Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.	1
ClaimBuster	20454	I think you believe in them.	0
ClaimBuster	20455	We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	20456	This is -- this is an important part of the world for us.	0
ClaimBuster	20457	Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things.	0
ClaimBuster	20458	Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	20459	But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.	1
ClaimBuster	20460	But we tried this before, promising people an election year tax cut that's not paid for.	1
ClaimBuster	20461	That's why he called him a grave threat.	0
ClaimBuster	20462	This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.	0
ClaimBuster	20463	This is an administration that's had no plan.	0
ClaimBuster	20464	If you're 10 we'll put you here, 12 you put here.	1
ClaimBuster	20465	We can build a new modern electric grid.	0
ClaimBuster	20466	The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	20467	I don't have any experience in gridlock government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else.	0
ClaimBuster	20468	The question is what we're going to do in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	20469	So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now.	0
ClaimBuster	20470	Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job.	1
ClaimBuster	20471	The constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school, in my view would be a great idea.	0
ClaimBuster	20472	They're using cheap hand guns.	1
ClaimBuster	20473	I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government.	1
ClaimBuster	20474	I think they stand for civil rights.	0
ClaimBuster	20475	I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.	0
ClaimBuster	20476	I would love to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	20477	Surplus is money -- more money than needed.	0
ClaimBuster	20478	Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.	0
ClaimBuster	20479	We gave them $150 billion back.	1
ClaimBuster	20480	They're in the civilian labor market and they're not fighting anywhere around the world today.	1
ClaimBuster	20481	When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach.	0
ClaimBuster	20482	We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	20483	And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.	0
ClaimBuster	20484	We don't know what's going to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	20485	Why don't you give back the money?	0
ClaimBuster	20486	Never wanted to commit troops.	0
ClaimBuster	20487	And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.	1
ClaimBuster	20488	But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light.	0
ClaimBuster	20489	Who does he owe money to?	0
ClaimBuster	20490	Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers.	1
ClaimBuster	20491	I sometimes think he's like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure that'll work.	0
ClaimBuster	20492	But they come to me and they say, please get the Congress to stop passing so many mandates telling us how to control things.	0
ClaimBuster	20493	We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.	0
ClaimBuster	20494	As a matter of fact, I'm the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and I'm very proud of that.	1
ClaimBuster	20495	I think this election has to be geared toward the future.	0
ClaimBuster	20496	So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Jong Il, not just one.	1
ClaimBuster	20497	This president and his administration have told you and all of us it's not a question of when, it's a question of -- excuse me -- not a question of if, it's a question of when.	0
ClaimBuster	20498	Now, the facts are we have to fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	20499	And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things.	0
ClaimBuster	20500	We need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit, and we'll have that soon.	0
ClaimBuster	20501	And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh - identify any particular course of action uh - when I responded to a question a week or so ago.	0
ClaimBuster	20502	He should be held accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	20503	His words amount to genocide incitation.	0
ClaimBuster	20504	Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job.	0
ClaimBuster	20505	But that's not the question.	0
ClaimBuster	20506	But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.	1
ClaimBuster	20507	She talks about solar panels.	1
ClaimBuster	20508	I get the last word (inaudible) I hope.	0
ClaimBuster	20509	If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.	0
ClaimBuster	20510	And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	20511	I want to make sure the education system fulfills its hope and promise.	0
ClaimBuster	20512	And we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious.	0
ClaimBuster	20513	The death penalty is a very serious business, Leo.	0
ClaimBuster	20514	One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.	1
ClaimBuster	20515	But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.	0
ClaimBuster	20516	Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?	0
ClaimBuster	20517	This -- this is a critical opportunity for America.	0
ClaimBuster	20518	... just a quick follow-up on this.	0
ClaimBuster	20519	Like Kyoto Treaty would have done.	0
ClaimBuster	20520	And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.	0
ClaimBuster	20521	We're going to build alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	20522	You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	20523	So how much did you cut (inaudible)?	0
ClaimBuster	20524	We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.	0
ClaimBuster	20525	We can also have a- an end to the extremes.	0
ClaimBuster	20526	Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.	1
ClaimBuster	20527	I want to do -- I don't like this idea of these boards.	0
ClaimBuster	20528	The president has never said whether or not he would do that.	1
ClaimBuster	20529	And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	20530	That's why I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay.	1
ClaimBuster	20531	When we went out to south central in Los Angeles -- some of you may remember the riots there.	0
ClaimBuster	20532	But as well, we need to continue to pursue adult stem-cell research.	0
ClaimBuster	20533	We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.	0
ClaimBuster	20534	My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.	0
ClaimBuster	20535	Can you run through the list again?	0
ClaimBuster	20536	First, he says he's for medical liability reform, particularly for OB/GYNs.	1
ClaimBuster	20537	It will require bigger cuts in Medicare than I vetoed last time.	1
ClaimBuster	20538	Now I'm back to square one.	0
ClaimBuster	20539	We seem to come full circle again.	0
ClaimBuster	20540	And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland.	0
ClaimBuster	20541	I have supported character education programs in our schools, drug-free schools programs.	1
ClaimBuster	20542	Jim, let's -- we've gone on a lot of topics there, and so it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools...	0
ClaimBuster	20543	So some of it is unfair.	0
ClaimBuster	20544	Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions.	1
ClaimBuster	20545	We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now.	0
ClaimBuster	20546	We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a -- a -- a solution to this, which says -- which stops this -- this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America.	0
ClaimBuster	20547	And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea.	1
ClaimBuster	20548	And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?	0
ClaimBuster	20549	The Vice President suggested a number of things.	1
ClaimBuster	20550	"I think John McCain called the energy bill the ""No Lobbyist Left Behind"" bill."	1
ClaimBuster	20551	No, let -- let -- let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and -- and -- and let's get them correct.	0
ClaimBuster	20552	But they're basically American, I believe in them.	0
ClaimBuster	20553	I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	20554	And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.	0
ClaimBuster	20555	This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Senator Obama and government decide that for them.	0
ClaimBuster	20556	"Some say, ""well, you're a little old fashioned."""	0
ClaimBuster	20557	We have to make it possible.	0
ClaimBuster	20558	She's a reformer through and through.	0
ClaimBuster	20559	Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again.	0
ClaimBuster	20560	And we can do so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been getting that support, and do it in a way which will bring down violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs that's pouring into the country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	20561	We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.	1
ClaimBuster	20562	There's a sense of American occupation.	0
ClaimBuster	20563	Now give me 1 second...	0
ClaimBuster	20564	You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.	0
ClaimBuster	20565	And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history.	1
ClaimBuster	20566	I think that is something we have to take seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	20567	It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.	0
ClaimBuster	20568	I thought we were talking about immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	20569	You go upstate New York.	0
ClaimBuster	20570	And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just don't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	20571	I'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect.	0
ClaimBuster	20572	I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.	1
ClaimBuster	20573	And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain.	0
ClaimBuster	20574	We've changed for the first time since FDR -- since FDR we had the -- we've always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once.	1
ClaimBuster	20575	The president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.	1
ClaimBuster	20576	It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president.	0
ClaimBuster	20577	Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus.	1
ClaimBuster	20578	We've got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do, so you can make a judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	20579	I'll get incomes up again.	0
ClaimBuster	20580	I'm not for gay marriage.	0
ClaimBuster	20581	But here's the point he misses.	0
ClaimBuster	20582	And they told me they could not have performed their duty, the duty we all expect of them, if they did not have the ability to communicate with each other under the Patriot Act.	1
ClaimBuster	20583	We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.	0
ClaimBuster	20584	But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.	0
ClaimBuster	20585	Gonna have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we're going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20586	The Social Security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase.	1
ClaimBuster	20587	I think somebody who doesn't want me to be president might have run that ad.	0
ClaimBuster	20588	Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.	0
ClaimBuster	20589	I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench.	0
ClaimBuster	20590	You don't like the answer, but it's an answer.	0
ClaimBuster	20591	The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years.	0
ClaimBuster	20592	We all remember Pearl Harbor.	0
ClaimBuster	20593	That's a lot of marijuana.	0
ClaimBuster	20594	We've seen progress over the past several years.	1
ClaimBuster	20595	Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee.	1
ClaimBuster	20596	"The president stood right here in this hall four years ago, and he was asked a question by somebody just like you, ""Under what circumstances would you send people to war?"""	1
ClaimBuster	20597	DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	20598	And they're over there, not over here.	1
ClaimBuster	20599	But this can't keep on going.	0
ClaimBuster	20600	This is just 1 of 1000.	1
ClaimBuster	20601	I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...	0
ClaimBuster	20602	We're going to balance the budget, by the year 2002.	0
ClaimBuster	20603	This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.	0
ClaimBuster	20604	I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well.	0
ClaimBuster	20605	I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.	0
ClaimBuster	20606	Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.	1
ClaimBuster	20607	The ideas I express are mine.	0
ClaimBuster	20608	Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it.	1
ClaimBuster	20609	We certainly must maintain an engagement there.	0
ClaimBuster	20610	It's a fundamental difference between what we believe.	0
ClaimBuster	20611	I'm tired of being told we can't.	0
ClaimBuster	20612	Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is.	0
ClaimBuster	20613	And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.	0
ClaimBuster	20614	Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that we're going to have to deal with in the next presidency.	0
ClaimBuster	20615	I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history.	1
ClaimBuster	20616	First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led.	0
ClaimBuster	20617	They feel that the levels we're operating at and the reductions that I have proposed are proper.	0
ClaimBuster	20618	He won't support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money.	0
ClaimBuster	20619	I'm totally focussed on the fact that we may have bank failures and nobody answered it.	0
ClaimBuster	20620	It's a time for unity.	0
ClaimBuster	20621	That's not where we are today.	0
ClaimBuster	20622	Mr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	20623	And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.	0
ClaimBuster	20624	But the important thing is what are we going to do now?	0
ClaimBuster	20625	"And the ""Los Angeles Times"" spent a lot of ink going into that."	0
ClaimBuster	20626	But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	20627	But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	20628	And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	20629	Africa is now the emerging area of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20630	And it's all a question of what our priorities are.	0
ClaimBuster	20631	The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.	0
ClaimBuster	20632	Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver.	0
ClaimBuster	20633	And the president of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy.	0
ClaimBuster	20634	Tom, wave like that and I'll look at you.	0
ClaimBuster	20635	So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.	0
ClaimBuster	20636	And I just told you the facts, sir.	1
ClaimBuster	20637	But at the time that uh - I submitted the Sinai agreement to the Congress of the United States, I submitted every single document that was applicable to the Sinai II agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	20638	But we can do them all at once.	0
ClaimBuster	20639	Well, I don't mind paying a little more.	0
ClaimBuster	20640	I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.	1
ClaimBuster	20641	I wish America had that kind of record and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.	0
ClaimBuster	20642	And you'll find a tort reform plan.	0
ClaimBuster	20643	No, I think you'll see --	0
ClaimBuster	20644	It's a fundamental difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	20645	I don't rule out modernization, and there are discussions going on now in the Congress, I know with the Pentagon, about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the triad.	0
ClaimBuster	20646	We agreed in principle on an insurance agreement, and we're working on three or four other areas now, but the way you have to do it is make sure you're competitive.	1
ClaimBuster	20647	What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president?	0
ClaimBuster	20648	Japan is trying to get the commercial airline business.	1
ClaimBuster	20649	But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	20650	And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.	0
ClaimBuster	20651	I can think of many.	0
ClaimBuster	20652	Actually, we've increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since I've been the president.	1
ClaimBuster	20653	But I'm not going to telegraph my punches, which is what Senator Obama did.	1
ClaimBuster	20654	"People say, ""I don't care."	0
ClaimBuster	20655	First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik.	1
ClaimBuster	20656	And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five.	1
ClaimBuster	20657	Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state.	1
ClaimBuster	20658	As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	20659	Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure.	0
ClaimBuster	20660	It may later be Catholics; it may be - later be Baptists who are threatened by some foreign country.	0
ClaimBuster	20661	There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon.	0
ClaimBuster	20662	If you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees.	1
ClaimBuster	20663	Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.	0
ClaimBuster	20664	It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	20665	And I don't want to give my friend Ross another shot at me here but I am fighting with the Congress to get this through.	0
ClaimBuster	20666	And of course he's going to raise your taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	20667	And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.	1
ClaimBuster	20668	But let me just tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	20669	And I've done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what I'd do.	1
ClaimBuster	20670	"They said, ""Well, these are the people that have the qualifications."""	0
ClaimBuster	20671	Now, we've made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	20672	First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.	0
ClaimBuster	20673	I'm going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort.	0
ClaimBuster	20674	That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	20675	Now, that -- put you in jail in corporate America if you kept books that way but in government it's just kind of the way things are.	0
ClaimBuster	20676	And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.	0
ClaimBuster	20677	I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.	0
ClaimBuster	20678	That is the number-one threat we face in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20679	The NAFTA agreement is defective.	0
ClaimBuster	20680	For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.	1
ClaimBuster	20681	The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.	1
ClaimBuster	20682	Together we can get anything done.	0
ClaimBuster	20683	He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.	1
ClaimBuster	20684	This is what it's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	20685	There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen.	1
ClaimBuster	20686	So, if we're at a point in history where we want to stop talking about it and do it, I've got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems, making the solutions work, and then moving on to the next one.	0
ClaimBuster	20687	They lost plenty of money on that one.	1
ClaimBuster	20688	This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources.	1
ClaimBuster	20689	First of all, by the way, I'd eliminate ethanol subsidies.	0
ClaimBuster	20690	It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	20691	But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.	0
ClaimBuster	20692	Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege.	0
ClaimBuster	20693	But apparently his position hasn't changed.	0
ClaimBuster	20694	They must not develop nuclear capability.	0
ClaimBuster	20695	I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption.	0
ClaimBuster	20696	This is one instance where I agree with - with the Republican platform.	0
ClaimBuster	20697	I know I can do a better job in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	20698	The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan.	1
ClaimBuster	20699	And Senator Obama says he's for nuclear, but he's against reprocessing and he's against storing.	1
ClaimBuster	20700	Of course, I listen to our generals.	0
ClaimBuster	20701	We have to do a better job in human intelligence.	0
ClaimBuster	20702	But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...	0
ClaimBuster	20703	We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	20704	My plan has five basic parts.	0
ClaimBuster	20705	The second biggest surplus next to Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	20706	In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that.	1
ClaimBuster	20707	But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works.	0
ClaimBuster	20708	Whether it's organized labor or whether it's the Hollywood elite or whether some of the media elite or whether it's the labor unions or whatever.	0
ClaimBuster	20709	I believe that the world is changing fast.	0
ClaimBuster	20710	What service are you in?	0
ClaimBuster	20711	I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since I've been the president of the United States, but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going.	1
ClaimBuster	20712	What really matters is what happens to your future and what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility.	0
ClaimBuster	20713	It's got to be fair.	0
ClaimBuster	20714	They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.	0
ClaimBuster	20715	It's precisely what Kim Jong Il wants.	0
ClaimBuster	20716	Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws.	1
ClaimBuster	20717	We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.	1
ClaimBuster	20718	I'll be against it when I'm president.	0
ClaimBuster	20719	Yes, that's a great question.	0
ClaimBuster	20720	And you know what, the issue is changing.	0
ClaimBuster	20721	It would depend entirely on what they asked us to do, but the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements they've made and find a way to trust each other, and they're going to have to spend some time and trust each other.	0
ClaimBuster	20722	We've got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit's been reduced by 60 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	20723	I feel strongly about education.	0
ClaimBuster	20724	I couldn't agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free.	0
ClaimBuster	20725	By the time the century turns, we have got to have our deficit under control, we have to work out of so that surplus is building up so when the baby boomers like me retire, we're okay.	0
ClaimBuster	20726	It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.	1
ClaimBuster	20727	He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years.	1
ClaimBuster	20728	Why shouldn't you get what you want, as opposed to what some lobbyist cuts a deal, writes a little piece in the law and he goes through.	0
ClaimBuster	20729	I doubt that I acknowledged that this year.	0
ClaimBuster	20730	Americans shouldn't have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter.	1
ClaimBuster	20731	America needs a new direction.	0
ClaimBuster	20732	I think one of the problems we have, particularly for seniors, is there is no prescription drug coverage in Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	20733	He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there.	1
ClaimBuster	20734	We're at a fork in the road.	0
ClaimBuster	20735	Let me just quickly say, at the current pace, the president will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Union -- former Soviet Union for 13 years.	0
ClaimBuster	20736	If you itemize your tax return, you get no marriage penalty relief.	1
ClaimBuster	20737	Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this.	0
ClaimBuster	20738	But I think it's worth it, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	20739	So the General Motors experience is relevant.	0
ClaimBuster	20740	We've got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just don't have the money.	0
ClaimBuster	20741	Our diversity is a strength.	0
ClaimBuster	20742	Well, you know, I admire so much Senator Obama's eloquence.	0
ClaimBuster	20743	He caused the death of so many people.	1
ClaimBuster	20744	Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue.	1
ClaimBuster	20745	It's a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government.	0
ClaimBuster	20746	But it's in your hands.	0
ClaimBuster	20747	"And they all say, ""Well, it was a long time ago."""	0
ClaimBuster	20748	And I'll tell you exactly why.	0
ClaimBuster	20749	When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.	1
ClaimBuster	20750	At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.	0
ClaimBuster	20751	And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.	0
ClaimBuster	20752	We have much more manpower and much more equipment there.	1
ClaimBuster	20753	And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	20754	His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had.	1
ClaimBuster	20755	I am for the North American Free Trade Agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	20756	That's where he was when he came into office.	1
ClaimBuster	20757	And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	20758	We know where you're cutting right now.	0
ClaimBuster	20759	How much did you cut them by?	0
ClaimBuster	20760	Now on the question of gold.	0
ClaimBuster	20761	The President shouldn't have vetoed that bill.	0
ClaimBuster	20762	The force must be strong enough so that the mission can be accomplished.	0
ClaimBuster	20763	Well, I think the answer uh - as to the kind of person that I would select uh - is obvious.	0
ClaimBuster	20764	But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.	0
ClaimBuster	20765	I have disagreed with leaders of my own party.	1
ClaimBuster	20766	Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance.	0
ClaimBuster	20767	You shouldn't be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that's gonna -- and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable -- big word, but that means if you're working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you.	0
ClaimBuster	20768	You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when 9/11 happened.	1
ClaimBuster	20769	We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.	0
ClaimBuster	20770	I would uh - also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain.	0
ClaimBuster	20771	We set a very high standard for ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	20772	And I cannot let that stand, because it isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	20773	And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.	0
ClaimBuster	20774	Now, on the Middle East, as you know, I worked very hard for peace in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	20775	I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission.	0
ClaimBuster	20776	And in addition, the tax program of the Ford administration, which provides an incentive for industry to move into our major uh - metropolitan areas, into the inner cities, will bring jobs where people are, and help to revitalize those cities as they can be.	1
ClaimBuster	20777	We spoke a multitude of tongues.	1
ClaimBuster	20778	Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly.	0
ClaimBuster	20779	I was very disappointed in the fact that the uh - GAO released that report because I think it interjected political partisan politics at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	20780	If in the next 5 minutes a television announcer came on and said, there is a major international crisis -- there is a major threat to the world or in this country a major threat -- my question is, who, if you were appointed to name 1 of the 3 of us, who would you choose?	0
ClaimBuster	20781	And they will make those sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	20782	And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.	0
ClaimBuster	20783	I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.	0
ClaimBuster	20784	I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas.	0
ClaimBuster	20785	Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.	0
ClaimBuster	20786	And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	20787	Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added.	0
ClaimBuster	20788	And I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking.	1
ClaimBuster	20789	And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.	0
ClaimBuster	20790	"In our particular church, we did not use that term, ""born again,'' so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term."	1
ClaimBuster	20791	We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started.	1
ClaimBuster	20792	Number three, we do have to make sure that we're protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can't develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing.	0
ClaimBuster	20793	Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20794	I just figure, as lucky as I've been, I owe it to them and I owe it to the future generations and on a very personal basis, I owe it to my children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	20795	If I thought that there was no alternative, then I might feel differently.	0
ClaimBuster	20796	"Let me -- I'm not exactly sure what you mean, ""passes the global test,"" you take preemptive action if you pass a global test."	0
ClaimBuster	20797	We have to be tough on the Soviet Union, but I think the American people -- --	0
ClaimBuster	20798	And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path.	0
ClaimBuster	20799	And you say: Well, how are you going to pay for it?	0
ClaimBuster	20800	That old adage they use--we're going to soak the rich- -we're going to soak the rich--it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill.	0
ClaimBuster	20801	That's an incredibly powerful nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	20802	It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	20803	And so, today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost: $200 billion -- $200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it's in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	20804	We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.	1
ClaimBuster	20805	We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.	1
ClaimBuster	20806	The United Nations, Kofi Annan offered help after Baghdad fell.	1
ClaimBuster	20807	If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home -- nothing will ever replace that.	0
ClaimBuster	20808	And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.	0
ClaimBuster	20809	And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.	0
ClaimBuster	20810	I'd rather, if you gave me 2 bad choices --	0
ClaimBuster	20811	We're going to have to-the MX.	0
ClaimBuster	20812	There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I've been open, candid and forthright.	0
ClaimBuster	20813	We don't have good health care.	0
ClaimBuster	20814	You will know their names.	0
ClaimBuster	20815	I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.	1
ClaimBuster	20816	I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	20817	It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops.	0
ClaimBuster	20818	I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	20819	We've been battling over abortion for a long period of time.	1
ClaimBuster	20820	And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.	1
ClaimBuster	20821	We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.	0
ClaimBuster	20822	We're the best producers in the world, and I want -- I want the farmers feeding the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20823	That's what America is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	20824	There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.	0
ClaimBuster	20825	Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.	0
ClaimBuster	20826	What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go.	1
ClaimBuster	20827	They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.	1
ClaimBuster	20828	America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.	1
ClaimBuster	20829	Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris.	0
ClaimBuster	20830	Well, think about what the governor -- think about what the governor just said.	0
ClaimBuster	20831	I'm a pretty independent thinker.	0
ClaimBuster	20832	We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.	0
ClaimBuster	20833	There will be no more debates.	1
ClaimBuster	20834	Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.	1
ClaimBuster	20835	Well, just for the record, when I was governor we had the lowest -- second lowest tax burden of any state in the country, the highest job growth rate of any state when I ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances.	1
ClaimBuster	20836	That's why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax.	0
ClaimBuster	20837	I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don't believe that you're going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three.	1
ClaimBuster	20838	I've said that years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	20839	It seems to me that if we're going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.	0
ClaimBuster	20840	That's why we have to emphasize manufacturing.	0
ClaimBuster	20841	I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency.	1
ClaimBuster	20842	I'm for that proposed law, the governor is against it.	1
ClaimBuster	20843	That's what I thought we ought to do.	0
ClaimBuster	20844	We didn't think that was right.	0
ClaimBuster	20845	And I'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Senator Obama, that I'm not happy about either.	0
ClaimBuster	20846	The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China.	1
ClaimBuster	20847	How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs.	0
ClaimBuster	20848	When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	20849	But I don't believe this president can.	0
ClaimBuster	20850	I think a lot of people deserve credit and I've tried to give it to them.	0
ClaimBuster	20851	This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process.	0
ClaimBuster	20852	But I'm not in favor of rounding up people and -- and -- and taking them out of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	20853	Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	20854	Number two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis.	0
ClaimBuster	20855	But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	20856	But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.	1
ClaimBuster	20857	I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.	0
ClaimBuster	20858	So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.	0
ClaimBuster	20859	I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.	0
ClaimBuster	20860	The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid -- we've done it in Arkansas under budget pressures.	1
ClaimBuster	20861	In the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	20862	I don't think you can -- I don't think you can get results that way.	0
ClaimBuster	20863	He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed.	1
ClaimBuster	20864	One of the things we've done is we've taken the -- we're beginning to transform our military.	1
ClaimBuster	20865	And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker.	0
ClaimBuster	20866	And we hope that we'll be serving you in the White House in January of 1989.	0
ClaimBuster	20867	I've got to make this point, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	20868	Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free.	0
ClaimBuster	20869	So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.	0
ClaimBuster	20870	And I think when you make a mistake, you say I made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	20871	Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter.	1
ClaimBuster	20872	I see my friend Senator Mitchell.	0
ClaimBuster	20873	Instead, it's gone up by that amount.	1
ClaimBuster	20874	And what I have proposed is something much better.	0
ClaimBuster	20875	But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.	1
ClaimBuster	20876	Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them.	0
ClaimBuster	20877	The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending.	1
ClaimBuster	20878	And it's a big problem.	0
ClaimBuster	20879	And I'd say to the Reform party, take a look at the Republican party.	0
ClaimBuster	20880	We've got a very good record appointing women to high positions and positions of trust, and I'm not defensive at all about it.	1
ClaimBuster	20881	And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap?	0
ClaimBuster	20882	What's wrong with limiting the terms of members of Congress to 12?	0
ClaimBuster	20883	Let me first give you a sports update.	0
ClaimBuster	20884	And we're going to be fiscally responsible.	0
ClaimBuster	20885	You have to make tough calls.	0
ClaimBuster	20886	And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.	0
ClaimBuster	20887	And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	20888	We've got four million young people volunteering every year, the number hasn't gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	20889	And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.	0
ClaimBuster	20890	So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	20891	But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.	0
ClaimBuster	20892	One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	20893	The middle-class need a rescue package.	0
ClaimBuster	20894	But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.	1
ClaimBuster	20895	And I look forward to having that opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	20896	Secretary, you have no plan.	0
ClaimBuster	20897	Their budget weakened our support for education.	0
ClaimBuster	20898	You can't wish it away.	0
ClaimBuster	20899	And I have to defend the honor of my state.	0
ClaimBuster	20900	And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.	1
ClaimBuster	20901	And so, I don't think the Patriot Act abridges your rights at all.	0
ClaimBuster	20902	And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	20903	It's happening in other states that we visit, too.	1
ClaimBuster	20904	I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	20905	But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free.	1
ClaimBuster	20906	Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area.	0
ClaimBuster	20907	And finally, he said he's going to have a novel health care plan.	0
ClaimBuster	20908	You rely on good military people to execute the military component of the strategy, but winning the peace is larger than just the military component.	0
ClaimBuster	20909	It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more.	1
ClaimBuster	20910	So I think we have to change the nature of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	20911	I care about 100 percent of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	20912	Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?	0
ClaimBuster	20913	So Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	20914	We can't have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country.	1
ClaimBuster	20915	And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.	0
ClaimBuster	20916	And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.	0
ClaimBuster	20917	And I made it plain to them, we're not.	0
ClaimBuster	20918	So I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here.	0
ClaimBuster	20919	I'm going to get the training done for our troops.	0
ClaimBuster	20920	She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	20921	I think that measures like these are important.	0
ClaimBuster	20922	And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	20923	But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers.	0
ClaimBuster	20924	I saw a study that came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.	1
ClaimBuster	20925	I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.	1
ClaimBuster	20926	The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.	0
ClaimBuster	20927	What I was saying is, we're not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation.	0
ClaimBuster	20928	We didn't listen to the nuclear freeze crowd.	0
ClaimBuster	20929	And I hope it's as soon as possible.	0
ClaimBuster	20930	That's not going to happen, so long as I'm your president.	0
ClaimBuster	20931	And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.	0
ClaimBuster	20932	Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	20933	It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.	0
ClaimBuster	20934	"But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, ""Oh, look, we got even.''"	0
ClaimBuster	20935	Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.	1
ClaimBuster	20936	Because you left out one other exception, the health of the mother.	0
ClaimBuster	20937	And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system.	0
ClaimBuster	20938	Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism.	0
ClaimBuster	20939	It had a very, very big impact.	0
ClaimBuster	20940	But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.	0
ClaimBuster	20941	Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	20942	I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them.	1
ClaimBuster	20943	But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries.	0
ClaimBuster	20944	Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all.	0
ClaimBuster	20945	...will be there for you.	0
ClaimBuster	20946	While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	20947	So, in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	20948	We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	20949	And that didn't make any sense.	0
ClaimBuster	20950	Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if I'm President of the United States, when I'm President of the United States, we will stand with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	20951	When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	20952	For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	20953	And that's what I do.	0
ClaimBuster	20954	As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.	0
ClaimBuster	20955	There was a story today or yesterday in the Washington Post about my economic programs and my chief budget officer and my chief economic officer were both African Americans, even though the Post didn't mention that, which I think is a sign of progress.	1
ClaimBuster	20956	And a year later, 9/11 happened.	1
ClaimBuster	20957	Let me tell you about one of the governor's.	0
ClaimBuster	20958	To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan.	0
ClaimBuster	20959	Line item veto -- there's a good reform program for you.	0
ClaimBuster	20960	When I was a young man, my father was a senator opposed to the Vietnam War.	1
ClaimBuster	20961	If you're going to increase domestic oil and gas production - and we have to - you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh - develop their land or their wells.	0
ClaimBuster	20962	Now, it may not work.	0
ClaimBuster	20963	That's why they call the President the Commander in Chief.	1
ClaimBuster	20964	The Vice President did call Social Security a few years ago basically or largely a welfare program.	1
ClaimBuster	20965	So I can't tell you where it's coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS and I believe that we've got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	20966	She's raising the money from the people she wants to control.	1
ClaimBuster	20967	Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?	0
ClaimBuster	20968	The administration did not deal with it.	1
ClaimBuster	20969	You know, I support a national patient's bill of rights, Mr. Vice President, and I want all people covered.	1
ClaimBuster	20970	I'm ready to provide that leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	20971	Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.	0
ClaimBuster	20972	That happened when I was president.	1
ClaimBuster	20973	It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.	1
ClaimBuster	20974	And I'm glad that we have a good director in George Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	20975	The biggest crime increase in history, the biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas.	1
ClaimBuster	20976	And they'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others.	0
ClaimBuster	20977	Donald Trump is a small business.	0
ClaimBuster	20978	Congress -- they're all good people.	0
ClaimBuster	20979	The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	20980	George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.	1
ClaimBuster	20981	One percent of America got more than the 80 percent of America that earned from $100,000 down.	1
ClaimBuster	20982	And that was the line.	0
ClaimBuster	20983	It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business.	0
ClaimBuster	20984	But I want to touch on this is tobacco thing.	0
ClaimBuster	20985	We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	20986	We didn't make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important.	1
ClaimBuster	20987	that is a very good reason for voting for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen on the 8th of November.	0
ClaimBuster	20988	It's kind of Washington, D.C. focus.	0
ClaimBuster	20989	Number one, let's focus on jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	20990	It certainly looks that way.	0
ClaimBuster	20991	We're selling American automobiles in Japan now.	1
ClaimBuster	20992	My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his word.	0
ClaimBuster	20993	The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible.	1
ClaimBuster	20994	Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president.	1
ClaimBuster	20995	I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had.	1
ClaimBuster	20996	And so yes, everybody's taxed too much and I want to get the taxes down, but not by signing a tax bill that's gonna raise taxes on people.	0
ClaimBuster	20997	"And I -- and I went to my staff, and I said, ""How come all the people for these jobs are -- are all men."""	1
ClaimBuster	20998	It's an issue of principle, not politics.	0
ClaimBuster	20999	Why don't I want to raise taxes on people?	0
ClaimBuster	21000	And that means doing it under the Medicare program.	0
ClaimBuster	21001	Here is the role of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	21002	And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	21003	But I think it's important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	21004	I don't expect you to watch every vote.	0
ClaimBuster	21005	If they're safe, they're coming.	0
ClaimBuster	21006	I've been the governor of a big state.	1
ClaimBuster	21007	I think we can save lives.	0
ClaimBuster	21008	I'm running to get some things done for America.	0
ClaimBuster	21009	So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	21010	So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen.	0
ClaimBuster	21011	Well, Katherine, that's a great question.	0
ClaimBuster	21012	And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy.	0
ClaimBuster	21013	President Obama has moved millions of people out.	1
ClaimBuster	21014	If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you're narrow minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln.	0
ClaimBuster	21015	But -- but I can say this, that we're talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism we're seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and -- and confusion.	0
ClaimBuster	21016	If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	21017	That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.	0
ClaimBuster	21018	And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.	1
ClaimBuster	21019	And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously.	0
ClaimBuster	21020	Seventy-five percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice.	1
ClaimBuster	21021	I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	21022	I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met.	0
ClaimBuster	21023	I do understand creating jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	21024	Somebody somewhere has to take responsibility for this.	0
ClaimBuster	21025	Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	21026	If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21027	We are the strongest and most powerful free society on Earth.	0
ClaimBuster	21028	I don't think so, Candy.	0
ClaimBuster	21029	I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.	0
ClaimBuster	21030	We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table.	1
ClaimBuster	21031	And they both looked at me and said: We need you.	1
ClaimBuster	21032	We have a deficit because this country went into a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	21033	I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.	0
ClaimBuster	21034	The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.	0
ClaimBuster	21035	There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.	1
ClaimBuster	21036	Programs that we need, we should make them work better.	0
ClaimBuster	21037	If you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you.	1
ClaimBuster	21038	Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	21039	We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.	0
ClaimBuster	21040	What we need to do is raise the minimum wage.	0
ClaimBuster	21041	It means that there will be increased hires.	0
ClaimBuster	21042	And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.	1
ClaimBuster	21043	They do some great things.	0
ClaimBuster	21044	I think that says a great deal to the American people about the standards we'll set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	21045	And there's been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language.	0
ClaimBuster	21046	But I disagree that we don't know the cause of global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	21047	fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	21048	So, yes, some may be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	21049	And as I said: You can run but you can't hide the reality.	0
ClaimBuster	21050	First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	21051	He can't come here and tell you that he's created health care for Americans because, what, we've got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri.	1
ClaimBuster	21052	Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality.	0
ClaimBuster	21053	Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	21054	The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said.	0
ClaimBuster	21055	The most important distinction in this campaign is that I represent real hope for change, a departure from trickle-down economics, a departure from tax and spend economics, to invest in growth.	0
ClaimBuster	21056	I have fought excess spending.	1
ClaimBuster	21057	Well, that is just not accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	21058	It's time for a fresh start.	0
ClaimBuster	21059	Secretary Clinton also fought it.	1
ClaimBuster	21060	But I know putting artificial deadlines won't work.	0
ClaimBuster	21061	Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.	0
ClaimBuster	21062	"And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the ""Los Angeles Times"" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years."	1
ClaimBuster	21063	"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''"	1
ClaimBuster	21064	The President has asked for my advice.	1
ClaimBuster	21065	Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.	1
ClaimBuster	21066	But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.	1
ClaimBuster	21067	And I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	21068	You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.	1
ClaimBuster	21069	But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	21070	Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me.	0
ClaimBuster	21071	Let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	21072	We've got $40 billion going to Bermuda.	1
ClaimBuster	21073	I think it depends how you define it.	0
ClaimBuster	21074	President Clinton opposes voluntary prayer amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	21075	Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed.	0
ClaimBuster	21076	I had to make the decision to destroy more life, so do we continue to destroy life -- I made the decision to balance science and ethics.	0
ClaimBuster	21077	Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	21078	This race is about values, it's about change, it's about giving choices to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	21079	That's why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us.	0
ClaimBuster	21080	I remember something my dad told me -- I was 18 years old going to Penn Station to go on into the Navy, and he said write your mother -- which I faithfully did; he said serve your country -- my father was an honor, duty and country man; and he said tell the truth.	1
ClaimBuster	21081	I think people need to be held responsible for the actions they take in life.	0
ClaimBuster	21082	So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	21083	Gosh, I sure hope it's not the administration.	0
ClaimBuster	21084	Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today?	1
ClaimBuster	21085	Because there's not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldn't do it, even though it's working.	1
ClaimBuster	21086	Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.	1
ClaimBuster	21087	What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.	0
ClaimBuster	21088	Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.	1
ClaimBuster	21089	African-American incomes went up 33 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	21090	He has more of the same.	0
ClaimBuster	21091	It's the age of his ideas that I question.	0
ClaimBuster	21092	And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.	1
ClaimBuster	21093	And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.	0
ClaimBuster	21094	But in late '89 the president signed a secret policy saying we were going to continue to try to improve relations with him, and we sent him some sort of communication on the eve of his invasion of Kuwait that we still wanted better relations.	1
ClaimBuster	21095	The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets - the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets - for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958.	1
ClaimBuster	21096	In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.	1
ClaimBuster	21097	First of all, that's simply not true what he just said, of course.	0
ClaimBuster	21098	And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.	1
ClaimBuster	21099	I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.	1
ClaimBuster	21100	And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me?	0
ClaimBuster	21101	When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.	1
ClaimBuster	21102	I have fought to reform government.	1
ClaimBuster	21103	Yes, if we don't do something about it, we may find ourselves unilaterally, if I may use that term, dismantling some of these weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	21104	Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	21105	Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.	1
ClaimBuster	21106	He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains.	1
ClaimBuster	21107	Now, in the meantime, the special prosecutor, within the last few days, after an investigation himself, said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it.	1
ClaimBuster	21108	Number four, get to us a balanced budget.	0
ClaimBuster	21109	Well, you think it's relevant.	0
ClaimBuster	21110	Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesn't like this provision.	1
ClaimBuster	21111	When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers, hiring more teachers was important to growing our economy, Governor Romney said that doesn't grow our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	21112	Now, the President can say well he wants to mend it, not end it.	0
ClaimBuster	21113	I meet with them all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	21114	I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	21115	When I was campaigning in 1976, everywhere I went, the mayors and local officials were in despair about the rapidly deteriorating central cities of our nation.	1
ClaimBuster	21116	But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to -- the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school.	0
ClaimBuster	21117	We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.	0
ClaimBuster	21118	No longer do we give the image of being on the rise.	0
ClaimBuster	21119	Now, finally, if you can't pay the bills you're dead in the water.	0
ClaimBuster	21120	And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.	1
ClaimBuster	21121	It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.	0
ClaimBuster	21122	I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.	0
ClaimBuster	21123	Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.	1
ClaimBuster	21124	And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward, when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long-term competitiveness.	0
ClaimBuster	21125	Take, for example, Third World debt.	0
ClaimBuster	21126	We then started to build up Afghan forces.	1
ClaimBuster	21127	We're on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice.	0
ClaimBuster	21128	Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	21129	We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily.	1
ClaimBuster	21130	I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend.	0
ClaimBuster	21131	And still he talks about - uh success.	0
ClaimBuster	21132	But we've got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	21133	We just read on the front pages of America's papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to.	1
ClaimBuster	21134	Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums.	0
ClaimBuster	21135	And I think what we'll plainly do is what we did in 1983 when Senator Dole served, and this is something I think he did a good job on when he served on the Social Security commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century.	1
ClaimBuster	21136	I don't think that's true, but you know, let others fire away on it.	0
ClaimBuster	21137	And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.	0
ClaimBuster	21138	Also in 1975, we almost brought Israel to their knees after the uh - Yom Kippur War by the so-called reassessment of our relationship to Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	21139	This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project.	0
ClaimBuster	21140	Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of women's rights.	1
ClaimBuster	21141	Tom, can I respond to this briefly?	0
ClaimBuster	21142	I never, ever conceived of such a thing.	0
ClaimBuster	21143	So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws.	0
ClaimBuster	21144	So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we don't achieve our independence.	0
ClaimBuster	21145	Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.	0
ClaimBuster	21146	I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy.	1
ClaimBuster	21147	The other point I wanna make is about our defense.	0
ClaimBuster	21148	You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...	1
ClaimBuster	21149	He said he was going to broaden the base.	1
ClaimBuster	21150	I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012.	0
ClaimBuster	21151	Are we as strong as we must be if we're going to maintain our independence, and if we're going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival?	0
ClaimBuster	21152	We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	21153	Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	21154	This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people.	1
ClaimBuster	21155	Now, why does that matter?	0
ClaimBuster	21156	The only building that was guarded when the troops when into Baghdad was the oil ministry.	1
ClaimBuster	21157	If we have children who are not surrounded with love and affection -- you see, I look at my grandchildren and wonder if they'll ever learn to walk because they're always in someone's arms.	0
ClaimBuster	21158	In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as someone who's very different than who I am.	0
ClaimBuster	21159	And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door.	0
ClaimBuster	21160	I know I'm ready for it.	0
ClaimBuster	21161	Just -- would you like to hear...	0
ClaimBuster	21162	Not this one, however, that you bring up.	0
ClaimBuster	21163	I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	21164	First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened.	0
ClaimBuster	21165	But Kenny was a great talker.	0
ClaimBuster	21166	I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.	1
ClaimBuster	21167	And I hope people don't think that I'm questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.	0
ClaimBuster	21168	That's a decision that only a woman can make, after consulting her conscience and consulting her religious principles.	0
ClaimBuster	21169	So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	21170	If you could accept a little criticism, I went all across central Illinois and spoke about agricultural issues, about seven stops.	1
ClaimBuster	21171	That's been missing over the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	21172	And finally, championing small business.	0
ClaimBuster	21173	And I was surprised at the extent of it.	1
ClaimBuster	21174	I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	21175	That's a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, OK?	0
ClaimBuster	21176	Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried.	0
ClaimBuster	21177	You must be tough and smart.	0
ClaimBuster	21178	Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.	0
ClaimBuster	21179	And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those answers were affirmative.	0
ClaimBuster	21180	And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them.	0
ClaimBuster	21181	And I will keep that promise.	0
ClaimBuster	21182	Now, that's not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer.	0
ClaimBuster	21183	Well, first, uh - let me set the record straight.	0
ClaimBuster	21184	Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill.	1
ClaimBuster	21185	But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly.	0
ClaimBuster	21186	Now, you've shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that.	1
ClaimBuster	21187	I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	21188	I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.	1
ClaimBuster	21189	In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure.	0
ClaimBuster	21190	Eight countries have left it.	1
ClaimBuster	21191	The record does not show that.	1
ClaimBuster	21192	Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic.	1
ClaimBuster	21193	It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people.	0
ClaimBuster	21194	But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.	0
ClaimBuster	21195	But we came through all of those things and we achieved even new heights and new greatness.	0
ClaimBuster	21196	If I could respond to that.	0
ClaimBuster	21197	And they're going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	21198	What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	21199	And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.	0
ClaimBuster	21200	He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.	1
ClaimBuster	21201	And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.	1
ClaimBuster	21202	The federal program doesn't do that.	1
ClaimBuster	21203	It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year.	0
ClaimBuster	21204	And I don't want to respond in kind to all these things.	0
ClaimBuster	21205	You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.	0
ClaimBuster	21206	Certainly I'm not proud of it.	0
ClaimBuster	21207	I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	21208	Washington, by itself, can't do it all.	0
ClaimBuster	21209	I'm strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag rules on providers.	0
ClaimBuster	21210	I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	21211	And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority, because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat, and I did accept that intelligence.	1
ClaimBuster	21212	Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions.	0
ClaimBuster	21213	What we need is action.	0
ClaimBuster	21214	I got to watch the clock here.	0
ClaimBuster	21215	That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities.	0
ClaimBuster	21216	And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.	1
ClaimBuster	21217	Those are the Republican chairman's words.	1
ClaimBuster	21218	And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.	1
ClaimBuster	21219	For a return to traditions and values that we once had.	0
ClaimBuster	21220	I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.	0
ClaimBuster	21221	"Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, ""Thank God for those people back in the 1980's for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.''"	0
ClaimBuster	21222	But I'll also have a better plan of how we're going to deal with Iraq: training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a president whose judgment the rest of the world trusts.	0
ClaimBuster	21223	"That's how we repealed ""don't ask/don't tell."""	0
ClaimBuster	21224	People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life.	0
ClaimBuster	21225	But most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which Senator Obama said wouldn't work, couldn't work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	21226	We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.	1
ClaimBuster	21227	And, so, that's the way I'd reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report.	0
ClaimBuster	21228	Let me give you some specific examples.	0
ClaimBuster	21229	But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that.	1
ClaimBuster	21230	I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.	1
ClaimBuster	21231	Mr. Bush talked about taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	21232	We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it's waged right here in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	21233	Over the last four years we've made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	21234	Are we closer to peace?	0
ClaimBuster	21235	We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	21236	And we can't allow it to happen anymore.	0
ClaimBuster	21237	What we have right now in Washington is a place that's gridlocked.	0
ClaimBuster	21238	This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	21239	But I can tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	21240	And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	21241	This is what I have done.	1
ClaimBuster	21242	But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.	1
ClaimBuster	21243	We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled.	0
ClaimBuster	21244	A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.	1
ClaimBuster	21245	The fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and I'll make them secure.	0
ClaimBuster	21246	And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.	0
ClaimBuster	21247	And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother.	0
ClaimBuster	21248	"I wouldn't pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldn't be said in a school because it had the words ""under God"" in it."	0
ClaimBuster	21249	We can no longer afford to be second best.	0
ClaimBuster	21250	I don't know what the latest cost estimates are, but it's going to be in the range of 25, 50, 75, $100 billion.	0
ClaimBuster	21251	I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	21252	And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job.	0
ClaimBuster	21253	I know that doesn't directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values you're teaching.	1
ClaimBuster	21254	When I'm president, I'm sending that back to Congress and we're going to get a real prescription drug benefit.	0
ClaimBuster	21255	Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.	1
ClaimBuster	21256	But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions.	1
ClaimBuster	21257	It's in my health-care proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	21258	We've given away whole industries.	1
ClaimBuster	21259	The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today.	1
ClaimBuster	21260	And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.	1
ClaimBuster	21261	So I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	21262	When I'm President of the United States, I will keep my word.	0
ClaimBuster	21263	He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	21264	So I'm glad I took on that fight and I believe, with all respect, I was right and he was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	21265	So, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	21266	Of the 3 of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times, I have offered and passed campaign finance reform, offered, pushed for and passed in public referendum lobbyist restrictions, done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together not only to establish consensus but to challenge them to change.	1
ClaimBuster	21267	"Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage who've been in meetings when I would sit there and say, ""Is this the one we're going to talk about or do something about?"""	0
ClaimBuster	21268	I guess you'd say I'm a good steward of the land.	0
ClaimBuster	21269	That is my agenda and that is why I think that it's not just a question of experience.	0
ClaimBuster	21270	I'll be glad to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	21271	... on some of the issues that people care about tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	21272	But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.	0
ClaimBuster	21273	The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.	1
ClaimBuster	21274	Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.	1
ClaimBuster	21275	I can make American safer than President Bush has made us.	0
ClaimBuster	21276	We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.	1
ClaimBuster	21277	And then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families.	0
ClaimBuster	21278	I don't disagree with anything that the President said, except he waited four years to do these things, and my view is it ought to be, it will be done on Day 1.	0
ClaimBuster	21279	But it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.	1
ClaimBuster	21280	That's the main growing thing in the budget.	0
ClaimBuster	21281	I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned.	0
ClaimBuster	21282	As well, help is on the way, but it's certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87-billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops, and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	21283	America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.	0
ClaimBuster	21284	And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.	0
ClaimBuster	21285	Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law.	0
ClaimBuster	21286	So we have to look at this comprehensively.	0
ClaimBuster	21287	You'll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so it's less likely you'll be harmed in your neighborhood.	0
ClaimBuster	21288	By the president having five powers - four or five powers - and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government.	0
ClaimBuster	21289	I proposed a constitutional amendment.	1
ClaimBuster	21290	Testing is the cornerstone of reform.	0
ClaimBuster	21291	When I'm President of the United States we're going to have a governors' council and we're going to work directly with the governors to get power back to the people and back to the states.	0
ClaimBuster	21292	Everything comes out of your pocket and my pocket.	1
ClaimBuster	21293	I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	21294	He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.	1
ClaimBuster	21295	But I'll tell you what I was thinking of.	0
ClaimBuster	21296	But that -- that is not the case.	0
ClaimBuster	21297	But it isn't going to be working that way.	0
ClaimBuster	21298	Most health-care costs are covered by third parties.	1
ClaimBuster	21299	What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.	0
ClaimBuster	21300	I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.	1
ClaimBuster	21301	What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?	0
ClaimBuster	21302	And those teachers can make a difference.	0
ClaimBuster	21303	$3,000 tax credit to help your expenses in taking care of a loved one who needs long-term care.	0
ClaimBuster	21304	What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958.	0
ClaimBuster	21305	It's to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low.	0
ClaimBuster	21306	I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	21307	Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream.	0
ClaimBuster	21308	I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension.	1
ClaimBuster	21309	When we think of Russia, remember we're thinking of many countries, now.	0
ClaimBuster	21310	He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did.	1
ClaimBuster	21311	We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	21312	We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right.	0
ClaimBuster	21313	Now, the question is, can we win?	0
ClaimBuster	21314	That's what Washington, D.C. needs.	0
ClaimBuster	21315	And there's a whole bunch of other things that I can't click off in this short period of time.	0
ClaimBuster	21316	What we're now talking about is the Vice President's determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area.	1
ClaimBuster	21317	I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.	0
ClaimBuster	21318	I said, do you get audited?	0
ClaimBuster	21319	But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings.	0
ClaimBuster	21320	But no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh - decision might be or what option he might exercise.	0
ClaimBuster	21321	And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics.	0
ClaimBuster	21322	They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	21323	And thank God, it has, because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.	0
ClaimBuster	21324	And it's very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate.	0
ClaimBuster	21325	Donald, she has a name.	1
ClaimBuster	21326	And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said: This aggression will not stand.	1
ClaimBuster	21327	Now it's in over 30 countries.	1
ClaimBuster	21328	They pulled out of the global warming, declared it dead, didn't even accept the science.	1
ClaimBuster	21329	I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school.	0
ClaimBuster	21330	But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev.	0
ClaimBuster	21331	We have got to pull together.	0
ClaimBuster	21332	And the result over time was the Taliban, Al Qaida, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today.	0
ClaimBuster	21333	And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working.	0
ClaimBuster	21334	I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now.	0
ClaimBuster	21335	The quality of the air is cleaner since I've been the president of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	21336	My opponent voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	21337	We have every two years tests that look at how well our kids are doing.	1
ClaimBuster	21338	I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument.	0
ClaimBuster	21339	Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.	1
ClaimBuster	21340	My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes.	1
ClaimBuster	21341	And we can renew and rekindle the American spirit and make our future what our founders dreamed it could be.	0
ClaimBuster	21342	And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.	1
ClaimBuster	21343	This is not an easy situation.	0
ClaimBuster	21344	If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people.	0
ClaimBuster	21345	Now, I said there was a contrast.	1
ClaimBuster	21346	And if you really want to get involved, just tap into my home page, www.DoleKemp96.org.	0
ClaimBuster	21347	What kind of rights will Americans have?	0
ClaimBuster	21348	I don't claim to know all the answers.	0
ClaimBuster	21349	It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear.	0
ClaimBuster	21350	Here are some promises that I'll make to you now.	0
ClaimBuster	21351	It isn't just naive; it's dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	21352	An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.	1
ClaimBuster	21353	I also believe in the Golden Rule.	0
ClaimBuster	21354	The American working man and woman are not taxed too little.	0
ClaimBuster	21355	I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores.	0
ClaimBuster	21356	Obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years.	1
ClaimBuster	21357	That is the bottom line.	0
ClaimBuster	21358	Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.	1
ClaimBuster	21359	Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.	0
ClaimBuster	21360	I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.	0
ClaimBuster	21361	First of all, vouchers are up to states.	0
ClaimBuster	21362	So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	21363	Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu.	0
ClaimBuster	21364	But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for America.	0
ClaimBuster	21365	In order to lead, you first have to use the White House as a bully pulpit and lead; then you have to develop consensus or you can't get anything done, and that's where we are now.	0
ClaimBuster	21366	I thought we were going to have equal time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other 2.	0
ClaimBuster	21367	If it's administered swiftly, justly and fairly, it saves lives.	0
ClaimBuster	21368	And -- and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.	0
ClaimBuster	21369	Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again.	0
ClaimBuster	21370	They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state.	0
ClaimBuster	21371	I'm just gonna tell you what the real facts are.	0
ClaimBuster	21372	In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.	1
ClaimBuster	21373	And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.	0
ClaimBuster	21374	But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	21375	We got to have health care for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	21376	That is my commitment to you.	0
ClaimBuster	21377	But I didn't pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis.	1
ClaimBuster	21378	Let's put the American people to work, and let's build the kind of high-tech, high-wage, high-growth economy that the American people deserve.	0
ClaimBuster	21379	Another one is to invest and save and to stimulate growth.	0
ClaimBuster	21380	We've done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives.	1
ClaimBuster	21381	We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors.	1
ClaimBuster	21382	You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?	0
ClaimBuster	21383	Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.	1
ClaimBuster	21384	Put it to you bluntly, American people.	0
ClaimBuster	21385	Mondale was referring to an earlier debate between George Bush and Geraldine Ferarro, the Vice-Presidential candidates.	1
ClaimBuster	21386	Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still.	1
ClaimBuster	21387	And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	21388	In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest -- Pennsylvania -- are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case.	1
ClaimBuster	21389	Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.	0
ClaimBuster	21390	You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad.	1
ClaimBuster	21391	I don't want to --	0
ClaimBuster	21392	So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	21393	And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism.	1
ClaimBuster	21394	We've got one in Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	21395	Tonight I say to the President: Mr. Bush, for 12 years you've had it your way.	0
ClaimBuster	21396	He did not do so.	1
ClaimBuster	21397	The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it.	1
ClaimBuster	21398	The average senior citizen is spending a higher percentage of income on health care today than they were in 1965, before Medicare came in.	1
ClaimBuster	21399	Now, I'm going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: pay as you go.	0
ClaimBuster	21400	I'm going to spend some money on the key issues that we've got to work on.	0
ClaimBuster	21401	First of all, Israel is a true friend.	1
ClaimBuster	21402	You didn't want a status of...	0
ClaimBuster	21403	We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home.	1
ClaimBuster	21404	And he said also that his two favorite justices are Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas.	1
ClaimBuster	21405	And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with.	0
ClaimBuster	21406	We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh - research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	21407	And, Alan (ph), thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	21408	They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	21409	It can be a single-parent family.	0
ClaimBuster	21410	It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.	0
ClaimBuster	21411	In the last three months before an election, they're always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years.	1
ClaimBuster	21412	One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.	0
ClaimBuster	21413	And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.	1
ClaimBuster	21414	I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors - both Democrats and Republicans - have advocated resolving those troubles in those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation.	0
ClaimBuster	21415	More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases.	1
ClaimBuster	21416	We landed on this Eastern shore and then went out over the mountains and the prairies and the deserts and the far western mountains to the Pacific, building cities and towns and farms, and schools and churches.	1
ClaimBuster	21417	And I pay for every dime of it.	0
ClaimBuster	21418	All of these things can be done.	0
ClaimBuster	21419	But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.	0
ClaimBuster	21420	I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.	0
ClaimBuster	21421	Actually, Mitch McConnell had a minimum-wage plan that I supported that would have increased the minimum wage.	1
ClaimBuster	21422	People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.	0
ClaimBuster	21423	It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.	0
ClaimBuster	21424	Americans ought to have it too.	0
ClaimBuster	21425	My answer is, we're not going to spend taxpayers' money on abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	21426	We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office.	0
ClaimBuster	21427	There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.	0
ClaimBuster	21428	During this campaign we've seen a lot of television shows, a lot of bumper stickers, and a great many uh - slogans of one kind or another.	0
ClaimBuster	21429	On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	21430	It puts a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.	0
ClaimBuster	21431	Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	21432	They've cut the training money.	1
ClaimBuster	21433	I can tell you, it's rife.	0
ClaimBuster	21434	Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.	1
ClaimBuster	21435	And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.	0
ClaimBuster	21436	Perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside.	0
ClaimBuster	21437	She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.	1
ClaimBuster	21438	Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	21439	What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?	1
ClaimBuster	21440	It means their job is tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	21441	Just -- just -- just a quick follow-up, because I think -- I think this is important.	0
ClaimBuster	21442	This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	21443	Another is to pass -- to get our seniors to sign up to these drug discount cards, and they're working.	0
ClaimBuster	21444	Make your decision and vote on November the 3rd.	0
ClaimBuster	21445	I'm for research and development.	0
ClaimBuster	21446	Uh - in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it's permanent, it's enormous, it's growing every day.	1
ClaimBuster	21447	Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	21448	"He keeps saying, ""Look, I've created 5 million jobs."""	1
ClaimBuster	21449	I've got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad.	0
ClaimBuster	21450	Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?	0
ClaimBuster	21451	There's a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if he's so much for it.	1
ClaimBuster	21452	Obviously energy is going to be a big, big factor.	0
ClaimBuster	21453	No president had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before.	1
ClaimBuster	21454	I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	21455	Number three, we've got to control our own energy.	0
ClaimBuster	21456	I went to meet with the members of the Security Council in the week before we voted.	1
ClaimBuster	21457	Some small business owners, a lot of them, can't even afford health insurance for themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	21458	I think there are things to do in this regard.	0
ClaimBuster	21459	He is out there on out of the mainstream.	0
ClaimBuster	21460	Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, you've got a family budget.	0
ClaimBuster	21461	But I don't think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom.	0
ClaimBuster	21462	The American people want to keep opening doors.	0
ClaimBuster	21463	And I believe it'll work because, as Ross said, we got the plans.	0
ClaimBuster	21464	It will help change the world; that we can look back and say we did our duty.	0
ClaimBuster	21465	That's not the kind of small business promotion we need.	0
ClaimBuster	21466	A testimony to you, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	21467	And obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force.	0
ClaimBuster	21468	I think the American people deserve better than they're getting.	0
ClaimBuster	21469	I'm for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with.	1
ClaimBuster	21470	Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great.	0
ClaimBuster	21471	The elements of government through these tax incentives For example, a business that would not have, for a period of time, an increase in the property tax reflecting its development of the unused property that it was making wouldn't be any loss to the city because the city isn't getting any tax from that now.	1
ClaimBuster	21472	As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible.	1
ClaimBuster	21473	That's what a President's for.	0
ClaimBuster	21474	Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools.	0
ClaimBuster	21475	I just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for -- for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	21476	Maybe in your case maybe just two.	0
ClaimBuster	21477	These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future.	0
ClaimBuster	21478	We're doing the best we possibly can to share information.	0
ClaimBuster	21479	And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	21480	As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.	1
ClaimBuster	21481	And now they're campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors.	1
ClaimBuster	21482	Which is a big mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	21483	And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this.	0
ClaimBuster	21484	But I can say that I am dedicated to proceeding, and I met just last week with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union, and he indicated to me that uh - the Soviet Union was interested in narrowing the differences and making a realistic and a sound compromise.	1
ClaimBuster	21485	And how do we do that?	0
ClaimBuster	21486	We relied on the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East, which passed the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	21487	She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.	1
ClaimBuster	21488	It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they're still resisting.	1
ClaimBuster	21489	I believe a free Afghanistan is in this nation's interest.	0
ClaimBuster	21490	If you look at what's happened -- we've made progress, I want to say that at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	21491	I have my own little foundation that's raised about $10 million for the disabled.	1
ClaimBuster	21492	Give the government back to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	21493	I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.	1
ClaimBuster	21494	He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones.	1
ClaimBuster	21495	I do understand how to make things work.	0
ClaimBuster	21496	For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	21497	I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kalikian .	1
ClaimBuster	21498	We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	21499	Depends on how we respond to Russia and it depends on a lot of things.	0
ClaimBuster	21500	And as a result, they're like tinderboxes.	0
ClaimBuster	21501	It is because we've had 12 years of trickle down economics.	1
ClaimBuster	21502	Wear your safety toe shoes when you go.	0
ClaimBuster	21503	Give us a balanced budget amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	21504	He says he's for voluntary testing.	1
ClaimBuster	21505	There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs.	1
ClaimBuster	21506	I'm going to protect the working man by continuing to veto, and to threaten to veto until we get this new Congress, and then we're going to move forward on our plan.	0
ClaimBuster	21507	But it wou- uh - evidently uh - under the handling of the case it was not.	0
ClaimBuster	21508	Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is based upon the Shanghai Communique, of 1972, and that communique, calls for the normalization of relations between the United States and the People's Republic.	1
ClaimBuster	21509	General Brown has an exemply [sic] record of military performance.	1
ClaimBuster	21510	It's wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Senator Obama has opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	21511	"He won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."""	0
ClaimBuster	21512	The present leadership uh - there is uh - is fairly uniform in - in their purpose, and I think it's a close-knit group, uh - and uh - I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing.	0
ClaimBuster	21513	I support a strong national patient's bill of rights.	1
ClaimBuster	21514	But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president.	0
ClaimBuster	21515	That's got to be changed.	0
ClaimBuster	21516	I've been for faith-based initiatives helping to intervene in the lives of young children for years.	1
ClaimBuster	21517	And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.	0
ClaimBuster	21518	The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.	1
ClaimBuster	21519	But people make their own choice.	0
ClaimBuster	21520	Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker.	1
ClaimBuster	21521	And I have budgeted for that.	1
ClaimBuster	21522	An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel.	1
ClaimBuster	21523	When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	21524	It is breaking family budgets.	0
ClaimBuster	21525	I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	21526	But understand, we only have three to four percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil, which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem.	1
ClaimBuster	21527	I think my plan is better.	0
ClaimBuster	21528	If you look at his record in the Senate, he voted to break the caps -- the spending caps -- over 200 times.	1
ClaimBuster	21529	So to answer your question is, we're withdrawing, not from the world, we're withdrawing manpower so they can be stationed here in America, so there's less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to be -- we'll be more likely to be able to keep people in the all-volunteer army.	0
ClaimBuster	21530	Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery.	1
ClaimBuster	21531	I believe it's important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus.	0
ClaimBuster	21532	And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone.	1
ClaimBuster	21533	I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.	0
ClaimBuster	21534	These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law.	1
ClaimBuster	21535	Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	21536	And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.	1
ClaimBuster	21537	To this day, he has never had a hearing.	1
ClaimBuster	21538	Affirmative action doesn't mean quotas.	0
ClaimBuster	21539	See, all the folks up there at the top said the attention span of the American people is no more than 5 minutes, they won't watch it.	1
ClaimBuster	21540	But we also have to be smart, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	21541	Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?	0
ClaimBuster	21542	I'm totally opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market.	1
ClaimBuster	21543	I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care.	0
ClaimBuster	21544	There's lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	21545	And that means that we can't have any test of religion.	0
ClaimBuster	21546	Now, does that mean you're not struggling?	0
ClaimBuster	21547	And I think you can use the White House as a bully pulpit to stress the importance of these little children, particularly in their young and formative years, to mold these little precious pieces of clay so that they, too, can live rich full lives when they're grown.	0
ClaimBuster	21548	Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.	0
ClaimBuster	21549	You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute.	1
ClaimBuster	21550	I don't believe trickle down economics will work.	0
ClaimBuster	21551	But we don't use those people.	1
ClaimBuster	21552	And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	21553	The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.	0
ClaimBuster	21554	I don't believe in discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	21555	This president has left them in shatters across the globe, and we're now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs.	1
ClaimBuster	21556	I mean, you've got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	21557	That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.	1
ClaimBuster	21558	We cannot cast aside these regulations.	0
ClaimBuster	21559	And I think where I differ with the Governor of Massachusetts, because I am optimistic.	0
ClaimBuster	21560	Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the requirements, nuclear material requirements, for our Defense Department?	0
ClaimBuster	21561	No, there's been no change of heart.	0
ClaimBuster	21562	General McKiernan, the commander in Afghanistan right now, is desperate for more help, because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive Afghan -- Taliban offenses.	1
ClaimBuster	21563	They haven't formed a unity group, a council of some kind.	0
ClaimBuster	21564	But it's very hard for Republican's in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I'm interested in supporting.	0
ClaimBuster	21565	It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when we pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency.	1
ClaimBuster	21566	Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that.	0
ClaimBuster	21567	My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes.	0
ClaimBuster	21568	And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary.	0
ClaimBuster	21569	I think that would be a mistake, because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort.	0
ClaimBuster	21570	I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned.	0
ClaimBuster	21571	The Federal Government continues to spend too much.	0
ClaimBuster	21572	I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	21573	What I'm going to do is say to Jim Baker when this campaign is over, all right, let's sit down now, you do in domestic affairs what you've done in foreign affairs, be kind of the economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the House, and that includes all the economic side, all the training side, and bring this program together.	0
ClaimBuster	21574	Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.	0
ClaimBuster	21575	And as I said, this is not a partisan thing with me.	0
ClaimBuster	21576	Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it.	0
ClaimBuster	21577	You can't do it on the war, where he says well, I was with the minority but I guess I would have voted with the majority.	1
ClaimBuster	21578	I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes.	0
ClaimBuster	21579	Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full.	0
ClaimBuster	21580	And General Brown has indicated uh - his apology, his regrets, and I think that will, uh - in this situation, settle the matter.	1
ClaimBuster	21581	But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn.	0
ClaimBuster	21582	The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.	0
ClaimBuster	21583	And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.	0
ClaimBuster	21584	They actually said that she lied.	1
ClaimBuster	21585	We spend more on education 'cause we spend so much more on colleges.	1
ClaimBuster	21586	And I'm very proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	21587	I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.	0
ClaimBuster	21588	And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.	1
ClaimBuster	21589	When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn't solve them for 5.	1
ClaimBuster	21590	America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.	0
ClaimBuster	21591	I don't know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it.	0
ClaimBuster	21592	We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	21593	And, you know, we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesn't work.	1
ClaimBuster	21594	I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong.	0
ClaimBuster	21595	Uh - I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable - uh - Governor Jerry Brown, uh - Walter Cronkite, uh - Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh - William Buckley - many other people.	1
ClaimBuster	21596	But I want a diverse administration, I think it's important.	0
ClaimBuster	21597	So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.	0
ClaimBuster	21598	And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.	1
ClaimBuster	21599	"And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said ""I'm going to give tax cuts"" -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said ""tax cuts to everybody,"" including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history."	1
ClaimBuster	21600	Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses.	0
ClaimBuster	21601	The Social Security system was fixed about 5 years, and I think it's projected out to be sound beyond that.	1
ClaimBuster	21602	So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.	0
ClaimBuster	21603	Nothing will ever top NAFTA.	0
ClaimBuster	21604	There is an issue with the uninsured, there sure is.	0
ClaimBuster	21605	She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.	1
ClaimBuster	21606	And, you know, we've heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept.	1
ClaimBuster	21607	And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	21608	We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.	0
ClaimBuster	21609	Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day.	0
ClaimBuster	21610	What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there.	0
ClaimBuster	21611	I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	21612	And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.	0
ClaimBuster	21613	Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule.	1
ClaimBuster	21614	And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done.	0
ClaimBuster	21615	I get the casualty reports every day.	1
ClaimBuster	21616	An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can't finds a job, or a college level job, that's not what we have to have.	1
ClaimBuster	21617	I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	21618	So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.	0
ClaimBuster	21619	... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.	1
ClaimBuster	21620	And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.	0
ClaimBuster	21621	Now, you and I never got a ride on a lot of these yachts and fancy things it bought, but you and I are paying for it.	1
ClaimBuster	21622	Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough.	0
ClaimBuster	21623	You called it the gold standard of trade deals.	1
ClaimBuster	21624	And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.	0
ClaimBuster	21625	The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together.	1
ClaimBuster	21626	I never suggested espionage should stop.	1
ClaimBuster	21627	Well, I'm not for photo licensing.	0
ClaimBuster	21628	In addition to that, I believe that this element of discrimination is something that the South has seen so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which has now been corrected - not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living - because we have been trying to pick ourselves up by our bootstraps, since the long depression years, and lead a full and useful life in the affairs of this country.	1
ClaimBuster	21629	Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is.	0
ClaimBuster	21630	Once you have a policy, then you have to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy.	0
ClaimBuster	21631	You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	21632	But the name is there.	0
ClaimBuster	21633	But our long-term security depends on our deep faith in liberty.	0
ClaimBuster	21634	The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	21635	In addition, we're now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security.	0
ClaimBuster	21636	"I'm sorry we didn't have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, ""Well, we really didn't know much the first couple of years about foreign policy."""	0
ClaimBuster	21637	But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	21638	It can and will grow even more in the next four.	0
ClaimBuster	21639	Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up.	1
ClaimBuster	21640	It's a subject I'm very familiar with.	1
ClaimBuster	21641	That's why it's essential we win.	0
ClaimBuster	21642	With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.	1
ClaimBuster	21643	And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.	0
ClaimBuster	21644	You've got to help us over there.	0
ClaimBuster	21645	Last week he said that they were spending 3.7 billion dollars, or 4.7 billion dollars on this.	1
ClaimBuster	21646	No, I'm not sure I can promise that; I don't think either one of us can really.	0
ClaimBuster	21647	He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.	0
ClaimBuster	21648	But every economist - liberal, conservative that I'm familiar with - recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh - the first quarter of next year that we'll have an increase in real GNP.	0
ClaimBuster	21649	I believe in the Patriot Act.	0
ClaimBuster	21650	I find that deeply disturbing.	0
ClaimBuster	21651	We're talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20,000 new bureaucrats.	1
ClaimBuster	21652	I appreciate your -- your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from Nassau County that have come, thank you for your time.	0
ClaimBuster	21653	And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them.	0
ClaimBuster	21654	Why not leave it with them?	0
ClaimBuster	21655	I stood there, and I met the people.	1
ClaimBuster	21656	No, there's no difference on that.	0
ClaimBuster	21657	It doesn't speak to the equality of America.	0
ClaimBuster	21658	Anyway, that's for another debate.	0
ClaimBuster	21659	That's why I have a plan for energy independence within 10 years.	0
ClaimBuster	21660	I found a couple of other things we agree upon.	0
ClaimBuster	21661	And the other thing I think is important...	0
ClaimBuster	21662	The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?	0
ClaimBuster	21663	But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan.	1
ClaimBuster	21664	And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.	1
ClaimBuster	21665	And he said this about it.	0
ClaimBuster	21666	I think we've got to be very careful when we commit our troops.	0
ClaimBuster	21667	We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.	0
ClaimBuster	21668	Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send.	0
ClaimBuster	21669	I saw cases in West Virginia, here in the United States, where children took home part of their school lunch in order to feed their families because I don't think we're meeting our obligations toward these Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	21670	Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.	1
ClaimBuster	21671	Now we have a chance.	0
ClaimBuster	21672	And therefore, it seems to me that we should hold the lid, as we have, to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are - five out of six in this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	21673	What kind of programs are we for?	0
ClaimBuster	21674	I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.	0
ClaimBuster	21675	Now, what was his response?	0
ClaimBuster	21676	I had a record of working with Republicans and Democrats as the governor of Texas, and I was hopeful I'd be able to do the same thing.	1
ClaimBuster	21677	And I doubt in all candor if the president knows it.	0
ClaimBuster	21678	We have met young America.	0
ClaimBuster	21679	And first let me say that our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time, and I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions.	0
ClaimBuster	21680	That's why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	21681	So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average.	1
ClaimBuster	21682	You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.	1
ClaimBuster	21683	The question is, are people getting health care, and we have a strong safety net, and there needs to be a safety net in America.	0
ClaimBuster	21684	And I think we'll have some decrease in our disbursements.	0
ClaimBuster	21685	I'm not going to do that; I won't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	21686	And Business Week, which is not a Democratic publication, said that this Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal - and I quote them, I think - was completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressures which would destroy this nation.	1
ClaimBuster	21687	When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia.	1
ClaimBuster	21688	The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	21689	Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we're going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we're investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	21690	I can't think of any.	0
ClaimBuster	21691	And I don't think it should do that.	0
ClaimBuster	21692	A $10,000 deduction a year for the cost of college tuition.	0
ClaimBuster	21693	Now in addition, we had a very - some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	21694	So I have to stand up for myself.	0
ClaimBuster	21695	I know the private sector is.	0
ClaimBuster	21696	And I hope you'll give me an opportunity to serve again.	0
ClaimBuster	21697	Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women.	0
ClaimBuster	21698	But in almost every category they're lagging.	1
ClaimBuster	21699	If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.	0
ClaimBuster	21700	Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges.	0
ClaimBuster	21701	I know we're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	21702	And most Americans know the difference.	1
ClaimBuster	21703	Our military is meant to fight and win war.	0
ClaimBuster	21704	We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault.	0
ClaimBuster	21705	But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.	0
ClaimBuster	21706	The mayors that I've talked to in some of our leading cities tell!	0
ClaimBuster	21707	That's what the war on terror is about.	0
ClaimBuster	21708	Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement.	1
ClaimBuster	21709	So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	21710	She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.	0
ClaimBuster	21711	We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.	0
ClaimBuster	21712	If we can come together, nothing can stop us.	0
ClaimBuster	21713	Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question.	0
ClaimBuster	21714	Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton.	1
ClaimBuster	21715	I was not put on the ballot by either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money.	1
ClaimBuster	21716	I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice.	0
ClaimBuster	21717	But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	21718	That was not a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	21719	I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	21720	As far as aid for school construction is concerned, I favor that, as Senator Kennedy did, in January of this year, when he said he favored that rather than aid to s- teacher salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	21721	And if we do that, we can have an impact.	0
ClaimBuster	21722	That's an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best.	0
ClaimBuster	21723	I've asked in my security briefings why that is, and I can't go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you.	0
ClaimBuster	21724	If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit.	1
ClaimBuster	21725	And Colin Powell so stated.	1
ClaimBuster	21726	I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	21727	And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.	0
ClaimBuster	21728	There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in.	0
ClaimBuster	21729	...of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.	0
ClaimBuster	21730	And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office.	0
ClaimBuster	21731	Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make.	0
ClaimBuster	21732	Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.	0
ClaimBuster	21733	My argument with Governor Clinton -- you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it's fair to put it in focus is -- I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country's at war.	0
ClaimBuster	21734	Bob, let's not go into hypotheticals of that nature.	0
ClaimBuster	21735	Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	21736	I take him for his word.	0
ClaimBuster	21737	Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again.	0
ClaimBuster	21738	And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to CIA, where more pages were excised before it was printed.	1
ClaimBuster	21739	... the damage in his -- in his own party.	0
ClaimBuster	21740	This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward.	0
ClaimBuster	21741	But let's stop labeling each other and lets' get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	21742	And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	21743	They may be danger -- I voted I for everything since that time.	1
ClaimBuster	21744	If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us.	0
ClaimBuster	21745	As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration.	0
ClaimBuster	21746	But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	21747	Talk to the people that are working in those industries.	0
ClaimBuster	21748	I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do.	1
ClaimBuster	21749	And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.	1
ClaimBuster	21750	But absolutely we can be secure in the long run.	0
ClaimBuster	21751	But I think that -- I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly there's no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view.	0
ClaimBuster	21752	Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.	1
ClaimBuster	21753	So there's a great deal of cynicism out there.	0
ClaimBuster	21754	"He complains about the fact our troops don't have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it."""	1
ClaimBuster	21755	But let me talk just a minute about what we've done to avoid secrecy in the Ford administration.	0
ClaimBuster	21756	And the approach I took is one that I think is a balanced and necessary approach, to balance science and the concerns for life.	0
ClaimBuster	21757	Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.	0
ClaimBuster	21758	And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year.	1
ClaimBuster	21759	It means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job.	0
ClaimBuster	21760	I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America.	0
ClaimBuster	21761	I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the world's economic power.	0
ClaimBuster	21762	He has not indicated his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practices around the country, so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color.	1
ClaimBuster	21763	Those are the concerns of the people that are watching us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	21764	Not necessarily be in power, but here's what I'll say about the $87 billion.	0
ClaimBuster	21765	The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.	1
ClaimBuster	21766	I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.	0
ClaimBuster	21767	If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency room care, we're going have gag orders, we're going to have direct access to OB/GYN.	0
ClaimBuster	21768	Everybody says it'll create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	21769	And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.	0
ClaimBuster	21770	Now, why do I support the freeze?	0
ClaimBuster	21771	Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement.	0
ClaimBuster	21772	So this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions.	0
ClaimBuster	21773	And this is -- this is Georgian territory.	1
ClaimBuster	21774	One of them is in defense spending, because I've taken on some of the defense contractors.	0
ClaimBuster	21775	Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.	0
ClaimBuster	21776	Once a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls.	0
ClaimBuster	21777	Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.	1
ClaimBuster	21778	We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution.	0
ClaimBuster	21779	I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own.	0
ClaimBuster	21780	This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing.	1
ClaimBuster	21781	I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	21782	That was something that advanced the entire country.	0
ClaimBuster	21783	Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.	1
ClaimBuster	21784	She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.	1
ClaimBuster	21785	And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	21786	And he could have lowered the cost of Medicare and lowered your taxes and lowered the costs to seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	21787	Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	21788	Now, in my budget for the next ten years I propose $100 billion for this purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	21789	And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.	1
ClaimBuster	21790	But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes.	1
ClaimBuster	21791	And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.	0
ClaimBuster	21792	That's part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us.	0
ClaimBuster	21793	And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering.	1
ClaimBuster	21794	Third, we've got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads.	1
ClaimBuster	21795	Our housing programs have uh - gone bad.	1
ClaimBuster	21796	I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future.	0
ClaimBuster	21797	Productivity in this country is up, it is way up -- productivity is up.	0
ClaimBuster	21798	Yes, it's a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but it√É¬è√¢‚Äö¬¨s not an insolvable problem.	0
ClaimBuster	21799	And we've got a wonderful new superintendent there who's working very hard with the young mayor there to try...	1
ClaimBuster	21800	What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house.	0
ClaimBuster	21801	I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things.	0
ClaimBuster	21802	"But the president just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, ""Nope."	1
ClaimBuster	21803	"When the Secretary General Kofi Annan offered the United Nations, he said, ""No, no, we'll go do this alone."""	1
ClaimBuster	21804	I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find cures.	1
ClaimBuster	21805	We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures.	1
ClaimBuster	21806	But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	21807	And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president.	1
ClaimBuster	21808	Didn't even guard the ammo dumps.	1
ClaimBuster	21809	Listen, there is 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	21810	You don't want to join the International Criminal Court just because it's popular in certain capitals in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	21811	We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we've won every single one that's been decided.	1
ClaimBuster	21812	Well, it's a combination, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	21813	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	21814	Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he says we can't do something seventy-two other countries do, even though there was a small business exemption.	1
ClaimBuster	21815	A president can't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	21816	But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.	0
ClaimBuster	21817	I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.	0
ClaimBuster	21818	Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	21819	It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today.	0
ClaimBuster	21820	If he'd let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldn't have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Osama bin Laden.	1
ClaimBuster	21821	I -- I hope so.	0
ClaimBuster	21822	But we also need well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional forces.	0
ClaimBuster	21823	Milosevic's government refuses to release the vote count.	1
ClaimBuster	21824	The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	21825	The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work.	1
ClaimBuster	21826	When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.	1
ClaimBuster	21827	I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action.	0
ClaimBuster	21828	I know we need to ban partial birth abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	21829	$30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans.	1
ClaimBuster	21830	I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.	0
ClaimBuster	21831	You'd exempt Social Security -- I don't want to tax or touch Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	21832	My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat.	1
ClaimBuster	21833	At a very early age they learn how to learn.	0
ClaimBuster	21834	So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	21835	We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh - calendar year this year - something slightly under 6 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	21836	I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.	0
ClaimBuster	21837	But there's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	21838	I was not the standard bearer.	1
ClaimBuster	21839	So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	21840	Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.	0
ClaimBuster	21841	Believe it or not folks, you can't ship it all overseas, you've got to make it here.	0
ClaimBuster	21842	We're not going to have a draft so long as I am the president.	0
ClaimBuster	21843	For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like.	0
ClaimBuster	21844	In addition to that, we've suffered because we haven't had leadership in this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	21845	I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won't have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent.	1
ClaimBuster	21846	We've got a government of stalemate.	0
ClaimBuster	21847	I've often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them?	1
ClaimBuster	21848	I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda.	0
ClaimBuster	21849	When I was in a rope line just the other day, coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard.	1
ClaimBuster	21850	There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.	0
ClaimBuster	21851	And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side.	0
ClaimBuster	21852	And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.	0
ClaimBuster	21853	And I'm saying to Barbara, you know, we've always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us.	0
ClaimBuster	21854	So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.	0
ClaimBuster	21855	We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.	1
ClaimBuster	21856	She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.	1
ClaimBuster	21857	But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	21858	The NIH is doing a good job in research.	0
ClaimBuster	21859	Certainly not right when it's happening.	0
ClaimBuster	21860	Sometimes they don't like the decisions made by America, but I don't think you want a president who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing.	0
ClaimBuster	21861	If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	21862	It is -- I'm not so sure 80% of the people get the death tax.	1
ClaimBuster	21863	That's key to the strength of our nation.	0
ClaimBuster	21864	...here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.	0
ClaimBuster	21865	Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	21866	By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	21867	A lot of us are.	0
ClaimBuster	21868	And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years.	0
ClaimBuster	21869	I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21870	So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren't working very well, 18 government -- 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren't helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.	1
ClaimBuster	21871	And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?	0
ClaimBuster	21872	because you see China moving towards a free market economy.	1
ClaimBuster	21873	You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength -- and all at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	21874	We did it in my state, and we can do it nationally.	1
ClaimBuster	21875	I didn't want to give a slush fund to Halliburton.	0
ClaimBuster	21876	I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	21877	Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.	1
ClaimBuster	21878	Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Osama bin Laden -- than, excuse me, Saddam Hussein more important than Osama bin Laden?	0
ClaimBuster	21879	Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.	0
ClaimBuster	21880	We need to have transparency.	0
ClaimBuster	21881	Till you change it you're gonna be unhappy.	0
ClaimBuster	21882	Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.	0
ClaimBuster	21883	It's important that we do that.	0
ClaimBuster	21884	That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.	0
ClaimBuster	21885	Every part of my program I've shown how I'm going to pay for it.	1
ClaimBuster	21886	We got the most expensive health care system in the world; it ranks behind 15 other nations when we come to life expectancy, and 22 other nations when we come to infant mortality.	1
ClaimBuster	21887	Here is what I believe, sir.	0
ClaimBuster	21888	My plan requires testing of all students.	0
ClaimBuster	21889	And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way.	0
ClaimBuster	21890	And many of the public schools are meeting the call.	1
ClaimBuster	21891	The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there.	0
ClaimBuster	21892	You walk in, you put your little card in there.	0
ClaimBuster	21893	China should solve that problem for us.	0
ClaimBuster	21894	We canceled the B - 1 under the previous administration.	1
ClaimBuster	21895	Now we have the highest spending by Senator Obama's campaign than any time since Watergate.	1
ClaimBuster	21896	The -- first of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	21897	I assume she had nothing to do with it.	0
ClaimBuster	21898	I'm sure you probably have heard that.	0
ClaimBuster	21899	... she's going to vote this November.	0
ClaimBuster	21900	People will look it up.	0
ClaimBuster	21901	But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.	1
ClaimBuster	21902	This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	21903	They've tried to undo them.	0
ClaimBuster	21904	I'll answer it straight to America.	0
ClaimBuster	21905	And I'm pretty good at it.	0
ClaimBuster	21906	In dealing with terrorists, yes, we want to retaliate, but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating.	0
ClaimBuster	21907	As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security.	1
ClaimBuster	21908	They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.	1
ClaimBuster	21909	Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right.	0
ClaimBuster	21910	And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	21911	And most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest people in the country.	1
ClaimBuster	21912	The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	21913	I don't know how to deal with it exactly.	0
ClaimBuster	21914	I questioned his judgment and his character.	1
ClaimBuster	21915	And if a crisis comes up, I ask who has the judgment and the experience and, yes, the character to make the right decision?	0
ClaimBuster	21916	And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost.	0
ClaimBuster	21917	The United States is a strong country.	0
ClaimBuster	21918	And so I'm proud of my choice.	0
ClaimBuster	21919	And we've got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration.	1
ClaimBuster	21920	You know, I've made some decisions on Israel that's unpopular.	1
ClaimBuster	21921	And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they're paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.	0
ClaimBuster	21922	But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.	0
ClaimBuster	21923	Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin.	1
ClaimBuster	21924	As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.	0
ClaimBuster	21925	You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.	0
ClaimBuster	21926	These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.	0
ClaimBuster	21927	She called it the gold standard.	1
ClaimBuster	21928	And the WIC program, and the school lunch program with senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends.	1
ClaimBuster	21929	And production on private -- on government land --	0
ClaimBuster	21930	Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years.	1
ClaimBuster	21931	I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.	0
ClaimBuster	21932	The private market and individual responsibility always work best.	1
ClaimBuster	21933	And incidentally, an excellent -- I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it.	0
ClaimBuster	21934	As a matter of fact, uh - I've never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	21935	I see on the TV screens how hard it is.	0
ClaimBuster	21936	"In my faith tradition, it is -- it's written in the book of Matthew, ""Where your heart is, there is your treasure also."""	1
ClaimBuster	21937	We had to get their permission.	0
ClaimBuster	21938	Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	21939	Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.	0
ClaimBuster	21940	The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically.	0
ClaimBuster	21941	I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest.	0
ClaimBuster	21942	I'd like to ask the American people what, what's been accomplished.	0
ClaimBuster	21943	And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?	0
ClaimBuster	21944	And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	21945	Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.	1
ClaimBuster	21946	Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week.	1
ClaimBuster	21947	His was what he's done to women.	0
ClaimBuster	21948	And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since I've been president because we have pushed them hard.	1
ClaimBuster	21949	He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.	1
ClaimBuster	21950	Cheapest money you'll ever spend.	0
ClaimBuster	21951	The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II.	0
ClaimBuster	21952	They named him because of his votes.	1
ClaimBuster	21953	He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.	0
ClaimBuster	21954	That's the nature of the enemy, by the way.	0
ClaimBuster	21955	Well, I respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith.	0
ClaimBuster	21956	And incidentally, one of them is this.	0
ClaimBuster	21957	And I want to help people in the middle-class.	0
ClaimBuster	21958	We're standing with you strong.	0
ClaimBuster	21959	But it can sure be made better.	0
ClaimBuster	21960	On the one hand, it's a good deal but on the other hand I'd make it better.	0
ClaimBuster	21961	That we ought to ... in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	21962	It's catastrophic in certain ways.	0
ClaimBuster	21963	Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.	1
ClaimBuster	21964	I'm for a massive reform of the estate tax or the death tax.	0
ClaimBuster	21965	They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all.	0
ClaimBuster	21966	And because they didn't have a judicial intervention where she could go somewhere and get help, I voted against it.	1
ClaimBuster	21967	In regard to uh - price stability uh - I'm not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices.	1
ClaimBuster	21968	I'm a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	21969	She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.	1
ClaimBuster	21970	Now why were we successful, as our predecessors were not successful?	0
ClaimBuster	21971	We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today.	1
ClaimBuster	21972	Well, President, you're -- Mr. President, you're absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not -- not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they're taxed at a lower rate.	1
ClaimBuster	21973	Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.	0
ClaimBuster	21974	I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help.	0
ClaimBuster	21975	But we're going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan.	0
ClaimBuster	21976	You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom.	0
ClaimBuster	21977	And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.	1
ClaimBuster	21978	And that clock is ticking.	0
ClaimBuster	21979	Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures.	1
ClaimBuster	21980	The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.	1
ClaimBuster	21981	But we get the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	21982	Now, I honor your service in World War II, I honor Mr. Perot's service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever served, including Admiral Crowe, who was your Chairman of the joint Chiefs and who's supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	21983	I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21984	But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.	0
ClaimBuster	21985	I promise you I will keep mine.	0
ClaimBuster	21986	But the Saudi's and the Qatari, and -- and the Turks are all very concerned about this.	0
ClaimBuster	21987	And another one is: stimulate investment and savings.	0
ClaimBuster	21988	It's not the America that we have to have in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	21989	I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?	0
ClaimBuster	21990	Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.	1
ClaimBuster	21991	I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.	0
ClaimBuster	21992	I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.	0
ClaimBuster	21993	He said the centerpiece in my first four years is going to be a middle class tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	21994	I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	21995	I remember going down to Del Rio, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	21996	It is only in that way that we can persevere.	0
ClaimBuster	21997	It's been looked, When I was chairman of the finance committee which handled Social Security we looked at all these options, and one thing we've got to make certain, when I used to go home my mother would tell me all I've got is my Social Security, don't touch it.	1
ClaimBuster	21998	But the joint chiefs say we're stronger and more confident and solid than ever.	1
ClaimBuster	21999	He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.	1
ClaimBuster	22000	This is a matter of life and death.	0
ClaimBuster	22001	If he's serious about what he's saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and he tried that in 1985, and I think he's going to try it again.	1
ClaimBuster	22002	I've spelled out my position.	0
ClaimBuster	22003	They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.	1
ClaimBuster	22004	Trade grows about 12 percent year.	1
ClaimBuster	22005	So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.	0
ClaimBuster	22006	And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.	0
ClaimBuster	22007	If these young Americans don't have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they're not going to get jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	22008	I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people.	0
ClaimBuster	22009	I worry about morale in today's military.	0
ClaimBuster	22010	And I have worked and I admire President Obama.	1
ClaimBuster	22011	Property crime is down 40 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	22012	The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace.	1
ClaimBuster	22013	And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?	0
ClaimBuster	22014	I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country - a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands - we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	22015	And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now he's decided it'll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	22016	Well, look, Bob, as I said...	0
ClaimBuster	22017	We ought to be doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	22018	And it's my proposal, it's not Senator Obama's proposal, it's not President Bush's proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	22019	Number four, make sure we protect the integrity with the Medicare program and Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close which could have been the case if the 270billion dollar Medicare cut that I vetoed, had been enacted in the law.	1
ClaimBuster	22020	And if we're going to find a permanent, fundamental answer to this, it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people.	0
ClaimBuster	22021	All you have to do is speak to them.	0
ClaimBuster	22022	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	22023	Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.	0
ClaimBuster	22024	5000 students -- why is a high school that big?	0
ClaimBuster	22025	Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don't know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords.	1
ClaimBuster	22026	And the vice president doesn't believe in exploration in Alaska.	1
ClaimBuster	22027	I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	22028	The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power.	0
ClaimBuster	22029	I don't want to --	0
ClaimBuster	22030	I don't mean to be critical of uh - Senator Mondale, but uh - I was uh - very, very surprised when I read that uh - Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh - after the news story that uh - broke about General Brown.	1
ClaimBuster	22031	See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.	0
ClaimBuster	22032	Maybe I'm trying to save the money.	0
ClaimBuster	22033	I think that was a dereliction of duty.	0
ClaimBuster	22034	This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country.	0
ClaimBuster	22035	Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.	0
ClaimBuster	22036	If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.	0
ClaimBuster	22037	What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won't apologize for something like that?	0
ClaimBuster	22038	And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.	1
ClaimBuster	22039	Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing: Join me in rolling back the president's unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	22040	Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and that's where the mission went wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	22041	It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.	0
ClaimBuster	22042	Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you.	1
ClaimBuster	22043	I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests.	1
ClaimBuster	22044	I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.	0
ClaimBuster	22045	And by working with all of the nations in the region -- unlike the policies of this administration and unlike the President said, they have not supported negotiations in that region -- we will be much stronger, because we'll have the moral authority that goes with those efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	22046	Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity.	0
ClaimBuster	22047	And I think that this uh - is one example where uh - a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now.	0
ClaimBuster	22048	So I know it can work; I've seen it happen.	0
ClaimBuster	22049	I chose Senator Walter Mondale.	1
ClaimBuster	22050	People are willing to take risks.	0
ClaimBuster	22051	I'm doing it because all my life I've fought for a system of justice in this country, a system in which every American has a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	22052	And what about the mining of the harbors in Nicaragua which violated international law?	0
ClaimBuster	22053	To do what the Congress and Governor Clinton is suggesting, you'd isolate and ruin Hong Kong.	0
ClaimBuster	22054	All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	22055	And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	22056	He's done nothing about it.	1
ClaimBuster	22057	I need your support, I ask for your vote.	0
ClaimBuster	22058	He took his eye off the ball, off of Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	22059	He can set up a fact-finding committee.	0
ClaimBuster	22060	You heard what I said about my tax plan.	1
ClaimBuster	22061	If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists aren't after Quemoy and Matsu, they're a- they're after Formosa.	1
ClaimBuster	22062	Or do we want to go forward, marching together, as a nation of strength and that's going to continue to be strong?	0
ClaimBuster	22063	That's what we need more of, Candy.	0
ClaimBuster	22064	And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	22065	I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles.	0
ClaimBuster	22066	You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.	0
ClaimBuster	22067	"And so, when you say, ""There you go again'' -- people remember this, you know."	0
ClaimBuster	22068	In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national level.	0
ClaimBuster	22069	Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	22070	I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.	0
ClaimBuster	22071	That's right at the middle class.	1
ClaimBuster	22072	We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago.	1
ClaimBuster	22073	I supported -- I supported that.	1
ClaimBuster	22074	Will a woman's right to choose be protected?	0
ClaimBuster	22075	The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.	1
ClaimBuster	22076	Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	22077	Those issues you mentioned, Social Security, prescription drugs, the big drug companies are against the prescription drug proposal that I've made.	1
ClaimBuster	22078	We've got all kinds of giveaways.	0
ClaimBuster	22079	We need to have -- allow small businesses to write insurance across jurisdictional lines so small business can afford health care, small restaurants can afford health care.	0
ClaimBuster	22080	I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama.	0
ClaimBuster	22081	What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but we're shutting firehouses who are the first- responders here in America.	1
ClaimBuster	22082	He decides who the right people are.	1
ClaimBuster	22083	If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base.	0
ClaimBuster	22084	Well, the Social Security -- you're an expert and I could, I'm sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund.	0
ClaimBuster	22085	I proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform.	0
ClaimBuster	22086	So that'll stay the same.	0
ClaimBuster	22087	And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.	0
ClaimBuster	22088	We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.	0
ClaimBuster	22089	And to maintain that peace requires strength.	0
ClaimBuster	22090	It was because they were too extreme.	0
ClaimBuster	22091	The president said he'd cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	22092	And that's what's gonna happen in the State of Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	22093	He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.	0
ClaimBuster	22094	But on the big questions, about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, I'll stand by those decisions, because I think they're right.	0
ClaimBuster	22095	The S & L crisis was over, they're starting to sell assets, all that money was coming in.	1
ClaimBuster	22096	Horace Greeley said the only thing that endures is character.	1
ClaimBuster	22097	This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself.	1
ClaimBuster	22098	"When you guard the oil ministry, but you don't guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is maybe, ""Wow, maybe they're interested in our oil."""	0
ClaimBuster	22099	Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits -- in one place it was 35%.	1
ClaimBuster	22100	The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.	1
ClaimBuster	22101	We need to open up markets.	0
ClaimBuster	22102	We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that.	1
ClaimBuster	22103	And I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back.	0
ClaimBuster	22104	John, you heard the president just say that he thought he might try to be for it.	1
ClaimBuster	22105	He's mentioned some ways to do it--and I agree with those.	0
ClaimBuster	22106	A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.	1
ClaimBuster	22107	They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.	1
ClaimBuster	22108	Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family.	1
ClaimBuster	22109	But we have got to instill values in these young people.	0
ClaimBuster	22110	The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor.	1
ClaimBuster	22111	We're going to do it like you do it.	0
ClaimBuster	22112	I think that defense needs to be -- with fewer people in permanent armed services but with greater mobility on the land, in the air and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high technology weaponry and well trained people.	0
ClaimBuster	22113	And we need to stand with him.	0
ClaimBuster	22114	Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America.	0
ClaimBuster	22115	But the front on this war is more than just one place.	0
ClaimBuster	22116	In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it.	0
ClaimBuster	22117	And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don't deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they can't afford it otherwise.	0
ClaimBuster	22118	But let me just address what the president just said.	0
ClaimBuster	22119	Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly.	0
ClaimBuster	22120	But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.	1
ClaimBuster	22121	Mosul is on the border of Syria.	1
ClaimBuster	22122	So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union.	0
ClaimBuster	22123	And we have now achieved an historic arms control agreement.	0
ClaimBuster	22124	The average person wasn't benefitting.	1
ClaimBuster	22125	Well, let me start with Texas.	0
ClaimBuster	22126	We need to fully fund the act named for that wonderful boy Ryan White to make sure we're doing everything we can on research and treatment.	0
ClaimBuster	22127	There's nothing -- the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit.	0
ClaimBuster	22128	And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.	0
ClaimBuster	22129	After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back.	0
ClaimBuster	22130	We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...	0
ClaimBuster	22131	All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.	0
ClaimBuster	22132	Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended.	1
ClaimBuster	22133	Now, why did they reject it?	0
ClaimBuster	22134	And that's the way I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	22135	Let me make sure you understand my decision.	0
ClaimBuster	22136	I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.	0
ClaimBuster	22137	We'll have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	22138	Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?	0
ClaimBuster	22139	We told him he could take the northern part of Kuwait, and when he took the whole thing, we went nuts.	1
ClaimBuster	22140	I suspect we won't agree here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	22141	When I asked Yassir Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for three hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace.	1
ClaimBuster	22142	Ladies and gentlemen, the right war was Osama bin Laden and Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	22143	And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.	0
ClaimBuster	22144	Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?	0
ClaimBuster	22145	Well, I'd like to go back just one moment to the previous question, where uh - Mr. Ford, I think, confused the issue by trying to say that we are shipping Israel 40 percent of our aid.	0
ClaimBuster	22146	The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government.	0
ClaimBuster	22147	And with regard to friendship below the border and with the countries down there, yes, no administration that I know has established the relationship that we have with our Latin friends.	0
ClaimBuster	22148	Let's get that straight right away.	0
ClaimBuster	22149	You ought to go out and see around this country what's happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America.	0
ClaimBuster	22150	I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	22151	I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	22152	A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	22153	And the result is exactly what we see.	0
ClaimBuster	22154	Now, the tax relief that I propose is directed specifically at middle-income individuals and families.	1
ClaimBuster	22155	Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	22156	I vote against them, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	22157	It would be squandered, too, believe me.	0
ClaimBuster	22158	I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	22159	Wasn't a top-down approach, Governor.	0
ClaimBuster	22160	Instead let people make their own choice.	0
ClaimBuster	22161	These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month.	0
ClaimBuster	22162	I invited the former prime minister of Russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved, along with the head of Finland, to go to Belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the United States that would constitute basically a surrender by Serbia.	1
ClaimBuster	22163	You have a U.S. attorney here that sends `em back home, so I think that's pretty important.	1
ClaimBuster	22164	It also exists among minority groups.	1
ClaimBuster	22165	(Laughter and applause) But--but--see, let me make it very clear.	0
ClaimBuster	22166	And 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative.	1
ClaimBuster	22167	Sometimes the views have been distorted.	0
ClaimBuster	22168	I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help.	0
ClaimBuster	22169	The last point I'll make about small businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	22170	They say we should be satisfied.	0
ClaimBuster	22171	Let's look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America.	0
ClaimBuster	22172	And let's give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield.	1
ClaimBuster	22173	(LAUGHTER) I -- there's an old high school debating trick, which is to answer something and then attack your opponent at the end.	0
ClaimBuster	22174	The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.	1
ClaimBuster	22175	In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights.	1
ClaimBuster	22176	Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate.	0
ClaimBuster	22177	When they sell into us, there's no tax.	1
ClaimBuster	22178	I want it to be clearer.	0
ClaimBuster	22179	And we have a vacancy.	1
ClaimBuster	22180	And I will succeed for those troops, now that we're there.	0
ClaimBuster	22181	"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu."""	1
ClaimBuster	22182	Those are the kind of judges I will appoint.	0
ClaimBuster	22183	It's been a good instinct.	0
ClaimBuster	22184	I don't think it's a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America's environment.	0
ClaimBuster	22185	All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that.	0
ClaimBuster	22186	Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.	1
ClaimBuster	22187	If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be -- how are you going to keep faith with the seniors?	0
ClaimBuster	22188	Most people that are lobbying are lobbying the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	22189	What's in the best interests of our people?	0
ClaimBuster	22190	It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.	0
ClaimBuster	22191	And so I think you take a look at it.	0
ClaimBuster	22192	I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.	0
ClaimBuster	22193	Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear.	0
ClaimBuster	22194	Now they have the bombs and we're less safe.	1
ClaimBuster	22195	I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.	0
ClaimBuster	22196	This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it's part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds.	0
ClaimBuster	22197	Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about.	1
ClaimBuster	22198	I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out.	1
ClaimBuster	22199	And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially.	0
ClaimBuster	22200	Appreciate the chance to have a good, honest dialogue about our differences of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	22201	In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.	1
ClaimBuster	22202	What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	22203	Now, they're the 2 folks involved so maybe if you put them together, they did it.	0
ClaimBuster	22204	I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America.	0
ClaimBuster	22205	Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.	1
ClaimBuster	22206	And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did.	0
ClaimBuster	22207	Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does.	0
ClaimBuster	22208	You ask when do you decide to deploy them.	0
ClaimBuster	22209	I'll tell you how it's affected me.	0
ClaimBuster	22210	Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent.	0
ClaimBuster	22211	I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play.	0
ClaimBuster	22212	But there's got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere.	0
ClaimBuster	22213	Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge.	0
ClaimBuster	22214	And what we've seen over the last four years is something I don't want to see over the next four years.	0
ClaimBuster	22215	We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	22216	Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children.	1
ClaimBuster	22217	But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.	0
ClaimBuster	22218	If a Negro baby is born - and this is true also of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans in some of our cities - he has about one-half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby.	1
ClaimBuster	22219	You can't solve a problem unless you diagnose it.	0
ClaimBuster	22220	It's not working for the American family.	0
ClaimBuster	22221	And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	22222	We do not help it.	0
ClaimBuster	22223	I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	22224	I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.	0
ClaimBuster	22225	But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	22226	You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	22227	But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do?	0
ClaimBuster	22228	I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether it's the right choice for the country.	0
ClaimBuster	22229	Second, we have to face that in this world, economic security is a whole lot of national security.	0
ClaimBuster	22230	And I don't think they would have supported the uh - bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	22231	In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.	1
ClaimBuster	22232	We're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	22233	A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe.	1
ClaimBuster	22234	In other words, if you're a mom and you're pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one.	1
ClaimBuster	22235	I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	22236	In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	22237	I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	22238	Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area.	0
ClaimBuster	22239	That's why we have to move forward and not go back.	0
ClaimBuster	22240	Free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want.	0
ClaimBuster	22241	If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.	0
ClaimBuster	22242	But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...	1
ClaimBuster	22243	I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.	0
ClaimBuster	22244	These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that's built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	22245	I don't want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.	0
ClaimBuster	22246	And that's what I would say to that person.	0
ClaimBuster	22247	Well, I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	22248	Knowing what the size of the deficit was, knowing there was no plan to control health care costs and knowing that we did not have a strategy to get real economic growth back into this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	22249	Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be?	0
ClaimBuster	22250	And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.	0
ClaimBuster	22251	This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.	0
ClaimBuster	22252	That's why they're fighting so vociferously.	0
ClaimBuster	22253	Let me tell you something.	0
ClaimBuster	22254	And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	22255	A supporter of Senator Obama's is Warren Buffett.	1
ClaimBuster	22256	I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said.	0
ClaimBuster	22257	We're 9 million jobs short of that.	1
ClaimBuster	22258	First, we have to learn from the past, because we cannot afford to make the mistakes of the past.	0
ClaimBuster	22259	And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.	0
ClaimBuster	22260	Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.	0
ClaimBuster	22261	That's the only way we got him back.	0
ClaimBuster	22262	You've got to say what you're for and you've got to --	0
ClaimBuster	22263	I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.	0
ClaimBuster	22264	I believe that any law- abiding, tax-paying citizen who shows up in the morning and doesn't break the law and doesn't interfere with his or her neighbors ought to have the ability to work in our country and shouldn't be subject to unfair discrimination.	0
ClaimBuster	22265	He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	22266	For me, this is about jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	22267	And secondly, I repeat to you --	0
ClaimBuster	22268	But what we can't do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term.	1
ClaimBuster	22269	But that's not what you've done in the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	22270	Now the oil industry recently has had hard times.	0
ClaimBuster	22271	I will bring -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	22272	We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.	0
ClaimBuster	22273	Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	22274	Both I and all my predecessors have had a deep commitment to controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	22275	The answer was we got...	0
ClaimBuster	22276	there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available.	0
ClaimBuster	22277	If you believe that the California economy was better in 1992 than it is today, you should vote for Bob Dole.	1
ClaimBuster	22278	We have uh - just advocated uh - this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy.	1
ClaimBuster	22279	Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges.	0
ClaimBuster	22280	I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.	0
ClaimBuster	22281	The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.	0
ClaimBuster	22282	A commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	22283	And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.	1
ClaimBuster	22284	I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents.	1
ClaimBuster	22285	They're doing it all over America because they have to.	1
ClaimBuster	22286	Maybe that's why he's asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people's taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families.	1
ClaimBuster	22287	Now, we have tried -- our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we've met some resistance.	1
ClaimBuster	22288	Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	22289	I said that wasn't the right thing to do.	1
ClaimBuster	22290	I'll make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming -- coming generations.	0
ClaimBuster	22291	And it's a tremendously successful club.	0
ClaimBuster	22292	That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.	0
ClaimBuster	22293	Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons.	0
ClaimBuster	22294	You're almost not old enough to remember this.	0
ClaimBuster	22295	And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.	0
ClaimBuster	22296	Well, we can do better than that.	0
ClaimBuster	22297	Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent.	1
ClaimBuster	22298	The first half of '84 it's up 81/2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	22299	And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.	1
ClaimBuster	22300	That's the way the system works.	0
ClaimBuster	22301	So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúwe do it this way, so should you.√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù Now, we trust freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	22302	He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.	0
ClaimBuster	22303	And they all say to me that we don't want defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	22304	And people all find their ways to express it.	0
ClaimBuster	22305	And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	22306	My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	22307	And we're going lower, in my opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	22308	Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.	0
ClaimBuster	22309	"So for instance when he says, ""Yours is a $5 trillion cut."""	1
ClaimBuster	22310	My parents came to this country as immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	22311	Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.	0
ClaimBuster	22312	But you don't have to wonder if it's me talking.	0
ClaimBuster	22313	The government has nothing to do with it.	0
ClaimBuster	22314	As a matter of reality, Fm going to have to because we have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not being paid these are not taxes owed by average Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	22315	Well, first of all, Jim, I would like to respond to what the governor just said.	0
ClaimBuster	22316	I love my grandchildren --	0
ClaimBuster	22317	But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	22318	I just want to make sure that --	0
ClaimBuster	22319	I just want to make sure the return is good.	0
ClaimBuster	22320	And I think now that trust is being violated and it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the president ought to say tonight that he's not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on.	0
ClaimBuster	22321	And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	22322	It's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	22323	I have fought for reform.	1
ClaimBuster	22324	She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.	0
ClaimBuster	22325	We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.	1
ClaimBuster	22326	The debt and the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	22327	But I thought it would cost a lot -- I think there's a better way to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	22328	And I do resort to prayer.	0
ClaimBuster	22329	We've got this country going in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	22330	There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.	0
ClaimBuster	22331	And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table.	0
ClaimBuster	22332	I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people.	1
ClaimBuster	22333	Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things.	0
ClaimBuster	22334	And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of.	0
ClaimBuster	22335	It will require some funds, John.	0
ClaimBuster	22336	We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.	1
ClaimBuster	22337	The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion.	1
ClaimBuster	22338	I read his statement the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	22339	That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.	0
ClaimBuster	22340	So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.	0
ClaimBuster	22341	He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.	1
ClaimBuster	22342	First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says it's the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place.	1
ClaimBuster	22343	We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in -- in car companies like Tesla and -- and Fisker, making electric battery cars.	0
ClaimBuster	22344	And I've told everything I know about it.	0
ClaimBuster	22345	He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open.	0
ClaimBuster	22346	We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths.	1
ClaimBuster	22347	So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.	1
ClaimBuster	22348	I'll catch up with it later.	0
ClaimBuster	22349	Iran continued to sell oil to the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	22350	And I truly respect it.	0
ClaimBuster	22351	And I want to fight for them.	0
ClaimBuster	22352	We're going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history.	1
ClaimBuster	22353	If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.	0
ClaimBuster	22354	You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	22355	Well, I don't have any quarrel with that.	0
ClaimBuster	22356	We've been for that for four, five, six years.	1
ClaimBuster	22357	It's important for the success of Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	22358	When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don't think that's what America is all about.	1
ClaimBuster	22359	The president has denied 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire.	1
ClaimBuster	22360	I love the principle it's founded on.	0
ClaimBuster	22361	He's broken the pay-as-you-go rules.	0
ClaimBuster	22362	Most important good things that happen in America happen in families.	0
ClaimBuster	22363	In Africa we did not.	1
ClaimBuster	22364	And they are the people who ought to go behind bars.	0
ClaimBuster	22365	In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small business people to take out 401 K plans for themselves and employees and much easier for employees to carry it from job to job.	1
ClaimBuster	22366	I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one.	0
ClaimBuster	22367	That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.	1
ClaimBuster	22368	I'm going to keep my word to you.	0
ClaimBuster	22369	Where did you find this?	0
ClaimBuster	22370	But there's going to be a new Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	22371	We've made real progress there.	0
ClaimBuster	22372	The warning signs are real.	0
ClaimBuster	22373	If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too.	0
ClaimBuster	22374	But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine.	1
ClaimBuster	22375	I don't want to walk away from them.	0
ClaimBuster	22376	I have no hesitancy in saying so.	0
ClaimBuster	22377	So we've got to deal with that right away.	0
ClaimBuster	22378	I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.	0
ClaimBuster	22379	I think we need to have rating systems that are clear.	0
ClaimBuster	22380	That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela.	1
ClaimBuster	22381	But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim.	0
ClaimBuster	22382	There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.	0
ClaimBuster	22383	My administration started what's called the Proliferation Security Initiative.	1
ClaimBuster	22384	Less regulations if we want jobs here; legal reform if we want jobs here; and we've got to keep taxes low.	0
ClaimBuster	22385	But, if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I'm the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.	1
ClaimBuster	22386	Here's what I do: We take over Medicaid children from the states so that every child in America is covered.	0
ClaimBuster	22387	People are all over the country.	1
ClaimBuster	22388	And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	22389	And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.	0
ClaimBuster	22390	"People grabbed my arms and said, ""Please save my job."""	1
ClaimBuster	22391	Thank you all very much.	0
ClaimBuster	22392	You've got to have a clear vision.	0
ClaimBuster	22393	In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix.	1
ClaimBuster	22394	But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say.	0
ClaimBuster	22395	There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas.	1
ClaimBuster	22396	I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.	1
ClaimBuster	22397	There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.	0
ClaimBuster	22398	We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	22399	So we don't have the best.	0
ClaimBuster	22400	That conference has met six times.	1
ClaimBuster	22401	Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	22402	And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money.	1
ClaimBuster	22403	Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	22404	It's also a curious thing for him to say since right after 1993 he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	22405	We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months.	0
ClaimBuster	22406	You see, I don't think the American people are taxed too little.	0
ClaimBuster	22407	That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation.	0
ClaimBuster	22408	The Taliban came back in, Al Qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war.	1
ClaimBuster	22409	And I expect to win.	0
ClaimBuster	22410	If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	22411	The analysis that he's talking about leaves out more than half of the tax cuts that I have proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	22412	And it seems to me that this could be an adjunct, or certainly a great assisting agent in getting that done.	0
ClaimBuster	22413	Let me talk to the workers.	0
ClaimBuster	22414	But what I've also said is, if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more.	0
ClaimBuster	22415	In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	22416	Non-homeland, non-defense discretionary spending was raising at 15 percent a year when I got into office.	1
ClaimBuster	22417	I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	22418	Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic.	0
ClaimBuster	22419	have leased only 2% of the possible.	1
ClaimBuster	22420	Let's have a three-day waiting period, cooling off, so we can have a background check to make sure that criminals and people who really shouldn't have guns don't get them.	0
ClaimBuster	22421	Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then.	1
ClaimBuster	22422	The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO.	1
ClaimBuster	22423	We feel that uh - with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978.	0
ClaimBuster	22424	You've got a $260 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	22425	And I was in the state senate and I was governor and I'm an engineer, a Naval officer, a farmer, a businessman.	1
ClaimBuster	22426	The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.	1
ClaimBuster	22427	I've supported all the education programs.	1
ClaimBuster	22428	It comes right out of your paycheck.	1
ClaimBuster	22429	If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us.	0
ClaimBuster	22430	Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.	1
ClaimBuster	22431	There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.	1
ClaimBuster	22432	And I've said that I'm going to keep this Social Security entitlement, to keep that trust fund sound.	1
ClaimBuster	22433	As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues.	0
ClaimBuster	22434	And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.	1
ClaimBuster	22435	I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved.	0
ClaimBuster	22436	You and Mr. Mondale have already disagreed about what you had to say about recalling submarine-launched missiles.	1
ClaimBuster	22437	Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?	0
ClaimBuster	22438	And we can't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	22439	Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	22440	They will be protecting the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	22441	Now he can't have it both ways.	0
ClaimBuster	22442	And one way to do it is to get these deadbeat fathers to pay their obligations to these mothers -- that will help strengthen the American family.	0
ClaimBuster	22443	We have to remain vigilant, as I just said.	0
ClaimBuster	22444	Look at the 24 generals and admirals, retired, that have endorsed me, including the deputy commander of Desert Storm.	1
ClaimBuster	22445	Put everybody that's breathing to work.	0
ClaimBuster	22446	But he's promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and he's promised the same trillion dollars to them.	1
ClaimBuster	22447	I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.	1
ClaimBuster	22448	So where'd the increase come from?	0
ClaimBuster	22449	So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.	0
ClaimBuster	22450	But I am not going to shortchange our troops in harm's way.	0
ClaimBuster	22451	Then the president, in fact, promised them.	1
ClaimBuster	22452	People are going to come in from Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	22453	It's something to build on.	0
ClaimBuster	22454	Fortunately, a democracy took over, but this nation was embarrassed by this current administration's adoption of their policies.	0
ClaimBuster	22455	And if we haven't learned from the negotiating history on that, we'll never learn.	0
ClaimBuster	22456	Now, in 1984 they were told.	1
ClaimBuster	22457	But you heard the president just say to you that we've added money.	1
ClaimBuster	22458	America is great, because America is good.	0
ClaimBuster	22459	So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I've done, we have to do it by executive order.	0
ClaimBuster	22460	In 6 years -- I budget all this in my budget, and in 6 years the college program would cost 8 billion dollars over and above what -- the present student loan program costs 4; you pay 3 billion dollars for busted loans, because we don't have an automatic recovery system, and a billion dollars in bank fees.	1
ClaimBuster	22461	It's about what the 21st century is going to be like for you.	0
ClaimBuster	22462	When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army.	1
ClaimBuster	22463	She had one of the greatest lines of all lines.	0
ClaimBuster	22464	And let's not raise anybody's taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	22465	Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea.	1
ClaimBuster	22466	Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.	1
ClaimBuster	22467	And that one doesn't sound good and it's not affordable.	0
ClaimBuster	22468	Maybe you think that makes sense.	0
ClaimBuster	22469	And I've tried to do that in public life, all through it.	1
ClaimBuster	22470	Look, one murder is too many.	0
ClaimBuster	22471	And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?	0
ClaimBuster	22472	It is tragic that uh - the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context.	1
ClaimBuster	22473	And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips.	0
ClaimBuster	22474	I've seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I don't want to see us make reckless cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	22475	He wanted to give people rights.	0
ClaimBuster	22476	The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned.	1
ClaimBuster	22477	Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free.	1
ClaimBuster	22478	And we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means.	0
ClaimBuster	22479	But it's getting worse by the day.	0
ClaimBuster	22480	We need more troops there.	0
ClaimBuster	22481	His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.	1
ClaimBuster	22482	I'm not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment.	0
ClaimBuster	22483	More so you than me.	0
ClaimBuster	22484	Thank you for your question.	0
ClaimBuster	22485	I built an unbelievable company.	1
ClaimBuster	22486	They don't happen to be accurate.	0
ClaimBuster	22487	The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America.	0
ClaimBuster	22488	And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling.	1
ClaimBuster	22489	But I do not expect it to come.	0
ClaimBuster	22490	But next door, of course, we have Egypt.	1
ClaimBuster	22491	Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	22492	You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program.	1
ClaimBuster	22493	Nobody ever told the American people that we increased spending $1.83 for every dollar of taxes raised.	1
ClaimBuster	22494	I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters.	1
ClaimBuster	22495	I voted for IRA tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	22496	You just say: Hey, we don't agree with you.	0
ClaimBuster	22497	Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?	0
ClaimBuster	22498	And -- and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that.	0
ClaimBuster	22499	So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	22500	Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space.	1
ClaimBuster	22501	I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should.	0
ClaimBuster	22502	Now again, the White House is a bully pulpit.	0
ClaimBuster	22503	No, and they don't have to, providing we have the leadership that we put -- that I'm offering.	0
ClaimBuster	22504	If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit.	0
ClaimBuster	22505	So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this.	0
ClaimBuster	22506	But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	22507	We cannot lose those jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	22508	And that's why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law.	0
ClaimBuster	22509	She talks in favor of the rebels.	1
ClaimBuster	22510	However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill.	0
ClaimBuster	22511	Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.	1
ClaimBuster	22512	That's why we're moving in the right direction.	0
ClaimBuster	22513	Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.	0
ClaimBuster	22514	And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	22515	He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger.	1
ClaimBuster	22516	So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.	0
ClaimBuster	22517	Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said.	0
ClaimBuster	22518	That's not what we do.	0
ClaimBuster	22519	Five million people lost their homes.	1
ClaimBuster	22520	But in a nutshell we've got to reform our government or we won't get anything done.	0
ClaimBuster	22521	We've got a big difference there.	0
ClaimBuster	22522	Don't take my word for this.	0
ClaimBuster	22523	And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did.	1
ClaimBuster	22524	I don't ask people whether they're Republicans or Democrats.	0
ClaimBuster	22525	And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us.	1
ClaimBuster	22526	I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.	1
ClaimBuster	22527	But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	22528	Ninety-nine United States senators voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	22529	But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.	0
ClaimBuster	22530	I am the one who's in the middle on this.	0
ClaimBuster	22531	I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon.	1
ClaimBuster	22532	I'll have millions of people at my shoulder, shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done work speed -- because it's wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	22533	He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze.	1
ClaimBuster	22534	For comparable states our size, we're signing them up as fast as any other state.	1
ClaimBuster	22535	But Columbine spoke to a larger issue.	0
ClaimBuster	22536	It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes, and I don't believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that they are paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out.	1
ClaimBuster	22537	It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I'm not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before.	1
ClaimBuster	22538	Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks.	1
ClaimBuster	22539	We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s.	1
ClaimBuster	22540	And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.	0
ClaimBuster	22541	We're the most competitive country in the world now, and then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale, and that's what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do.	0
ClaimBuster	22542	It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done.	0
ClaimBuster	22543	You know, Mr. Bush has never appointed a judge.	1
ClaimBuster	22544	There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered.	0
ClaimBuster	22545	And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.	0
ClaimBuster	22546	It's a good one, though.	0
ClaimBuster	22547	One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	22548	The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges.	0
ClaimBuster	22549	We must have a society that's just and fair.	0
ClaimBuster	22550	And you know what happened?	0
ClaimBuster	22551	And if you remember four years ago, we had not only rising unemployment, but a lot of rising cynicism.	1
ClaimBuster	22552	Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.	1
ClaimBuster	22553	If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too.	0
ClaimBuster	22554	Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.	0
ClaimBuster	22555	I don't think that's the role of the president to pick you're right and you're not right.	0
ClaimBuster	22556	I just think trying to be popular, kind of, in the global sense, if it's not in our best interest makes no sense.	0
ClaimBuster	22557	But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.	1
ClaimBuster	22558	And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	22559	They will have a conservative bent.	0
ClaimBuster	22560	Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	22561	The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	22562	And we weren't diagnosing problems.	1
ClaimBuster	22563	I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.	0
ClaimBuster	22564	I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.	0
ClaimBuster	22565	She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	22566	I'm proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	22567	After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same.	1
ClaimBuster	22568	But it is inappropriate for us, just because there's a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people--and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it's the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions.	1
ClaimBuster	22569	I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	22570	And a feature that allows parents to automatically check with one click what sites your kids have visited lately.	0
ClaimBuster	22571	He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.	0
ClaimBuster	22572	I know the Cuban state as a police state, and all my life I've worked in a way that demonstrates that.	0
ClaimBuster	22573	Is my time up yet?	0
ClaimBuster	22574	The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	22575	So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh - with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military - they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	22576	This is an area where I've led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	22577	And if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here.	0
ClaimBuster	22578	The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	22579	And I suggest that in a free society owned by the people, the American people ought to know what we told Ambassador Glaspie to tell Saddam Hussein, because we spent a lot of money and risked lives and lost lives in that effort, and did not accomplish most of our objectives.	1
ClaimBuster	22580	I want it to be streamlined.	0
ClaimBuster	22581	A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	22582	It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	22583	If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means they're not going to have to sneak across the border.	0
ClaimBuster	22584	And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options.	0
ClaimBuster	22585	And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.	0
ClaimBuster	22586	And it's hard to build a consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	22587	That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding.	1
ClaimBuster	22588	It's for their security as well as ours.	0
ClaimBuster	22589	... but we believed that we could make the country better.	0
ClaimBuster	22590	But that's happening as we sit here today.	0
ClaimBuster	22591	Secondly, as an executive leader.	0
ClaimBuster	22592	And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.	0
ClaimBuster	22593	And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.	0
ClaimBuster	22594	And if they're not, there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	22595	I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	22596	will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	22597	Now, it's very important for our citizens to also know that I don't believe we ought to have amnesty.	0
ClaimBuster	22598	And people in Europe didn't like that decision.	0
ClaimBuster	22599	You mentioned Washington and Lincoln.	1
ClaimBuster	22600	Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week.	0
ClaimBuster	22601	He failed to take on somebody else -- the malpractice suit people, those that bring these lawsuits against -- these frivolous trial lawyers' lawsuits that are running the costs of medical care up 25 to 50 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	22602	There isn't any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let's have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven't been making an effort, he simply doesn't know what he's talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	22603	The math simply doesn't work.	1
ClaimBuster	22604	And that's the way it should be.	0
ClaimBuster	22605	And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.	1
ClaimBuster	22606	Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye.	0
ClaimBuster	22607	There is no bigger judgment for a president of the United states than how you take a nation to war.	0
ClaimBuster	22608	But it is a good program.	0
ClaimBuster	22609	Who's been managing this system?	0
ClaimBuster	22610	Well, that's a choice we have to make, isn't it?	0
ClaimBuster	22611	"I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, ""Ford to New York: Drop Dead."""	1
ClaimBuster	22612	Ladies and gentleman, he gave you a speech and told you he'd plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us.	1
ClaimBuster	22613	We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future.	0
ClaimBuster	22614	Not a single young American today is fighting or dying on any foreign battlefield.	1
ClaimBuster	22615	So the worst of all things has happened.	0
ClaimBuster	22616	Those who've come here illegally take their place.	0
ClaimBuster	22617	That is the present American position.	0
ClaimBuster	22618	Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause a 1 percent increase.	1
ClaimBuster	22619	I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	22620	No, it's not just campaign rhetoric.	0
ClaimBuster	22621	When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed.	1
ClaimBuster	22622	But the people are the ones that determine it.	1
ClaimBuster	22623	They grew up in the Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	22624	I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets.	0
ClaimBuster	22625	I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures.	1
ClaimBuster	22626	And so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care.	0
ClaimBuster	22627	I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	22628	I want you to be able to get a job.	0
ClaimBuster	22629	Well, Mr. Ford takes the uh - same attitude that the Republicans always take.	0
ClaimBuster	22630	But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money.	0
ClaimBuster	22631	That's an odd thing to say, since we've tripled the homeland security budget from $10 billion to $30 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	22632	Ross says, with great conviction, he opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement.	1
ClaimBuster	22633	They should be judged on their qualifications.	0
ClaimBuster	22634	We did not feel that I could commit.	0
ClaimBuster	22635	Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.	1
ClaimBuster	22636	We're not going to go alone like this president did.	1
ClaimBuster	22637	Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.	0
ClaimBuster	22638	We were safer before President Bush came to office.	0
ClaimBuster	22639	But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you'll never get there.	0
ClaimBuster	22640	But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions.	1
ClaimBuster	22641	And we worked it out, and indeed we're moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way.	0
ClaimBuster	22642	I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat.	0
ClaimBuster	22643	"Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say ""I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;"" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us."	0
ClaimBuster	22644	Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this but Hawaii does it.	0
ClaimBuster	22645	And we need to do our part.	0
ClaimBuster	22646	I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders.	0
ClaimBuster	22647	Now with respect to the deficit, the president was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen.	1
ClaimBuster	22648	It took three and a half years.	1
ClaimBuster	22649	I believe we should have a stronger military force.	0
ClaimBuster	22650	And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel.	1
ClaimBuster	22651	Let -- let -- let's...	0
ClaimBuster	22652	Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300.	1
ClaimBuster	22653	In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly.	1
ClaimBuster	22654	One last point I want to make.	0
ClaimBuster	22655	And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	22656	I'm interested in 240 million points of light.	0
ClaimBuster	22657	That was what he said.	1
ClaimBuster	22658	In the first place, uh - as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh - of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy.	1
ClaimBuster	22659	Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it.	1
ClaimBuster	22660	In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.	1
ClaimBuster	22661	That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years.	1
ClaimBuster	22662	I think we need to go back and take a look.	0
ClaimBuster	22663	We will not make war inevitable.	0
ClaimBuster	22664	But you talk about judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	22665	He was asked this on Univision the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	22666	So we did have at that time with good management, the ability to do both.	0
ClaimBuster	22667	They don't want to see the world break out into -- into various forms of chaos, because they have to -- they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	22668	I feel strongly about it because I don't want it to come out of my time.	0
ClaimBuster	22669	I've talked to them and I've listened.	1
ClaimBuster	22670	I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.	0
ClaimBuster	22671	When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you're deciding the future of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	22672	... because I'm -- I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.	0
ClaimBuster	22673	I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that.	1
ClaimBuster	22674	And because of the economy's slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there's no doubt that as president I'm going to have to make some tough decision.	1
ClaimBuster	22675	I don't believe it will happen.	0
ClaimBuster	22676	Unfortunately, Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it.	0
ClaimBuster	22677	Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.	1
ClaimBuster	22678	I understand how hard it is to commit troops.	0
ClaimBuster	22679	We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.	0
ClaimBuster	22680	But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective.	0
ClaimBuster	22681	You did not say that you would provide government help.	1
ClaimBuster	22682	It's to make sure we raise standards.	0
ClaimBuster	22683	I just think it's wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	22684	We give you broader competition.	0
ClaimBuster	22685	Well no doubt about it, our founding fathers had a great deal of wisdom.	0
ClaimBuster	22686	I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.	0
ClaimBuster	22687	There are no magic answers to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	22688	You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	22689	Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers.	1
ClaimBuster	22690	The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed.	1
ClaimBuster	22691	Now please, folks, if you don't hear anything else I say, remember where the -- millions of people at work are our tax base.	0
ClaimBuster	22692	We absolutely must, which is why I responded to your first question the way I did.	0
ClaimBuster	22693	But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?	1
ClaimBuster	22694	But they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion.	1
ClaimBuster	22695	You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America.	0
ClaimBuster	22696	And people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete it.	0
ClaimBuster	22697	But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.	1
ClaimBuster	22698	And yet you take their money.	1
ClaimBuster	22699	He's health for the mother.	0
ClaimBuster	22700	I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	22701	The means are at issue.	0
ClaimBuster	22702	And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	22703	Rudy Giuliani, Mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City.	1
ClaimBuster	22704	As the vice president is.	0
ClaimBuster	22705	That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.	0
ClaimBuster	22706	Every school and every school district, have every state test the children.	0
ClaimBuster	22707	Now, this has cost us deeply in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	22708	I think it's a good program.	0
ClaimBuster	22709	Senator Obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects...	1
ClaimBuster	22710	And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.	0
ClaimBuster	22711	And although there was a serious threat to the Social Security System and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when I became President, the action of the Democratic Congress working with me has been to put Social Security back on a sound financial basis.	1
ClaimBuster	22712	It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped.	1
ClaimBuster	22713	If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country.	0
ClaimBuster	22714	So this is what our program is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	22715	And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example.	1
ClaimBuster	22716	If you don't control the health care costs of the entire system, you cannot get control of it.	0
ClaimBuster	22717	And if I heard the statement day before yesterday, you said you would order -- he said he would order his FDA appointee to review the decision.	1
ClaimBuster	22718	I kept the faith with my family.	0
ClaimBuster	22719	And we didn't touch it.	1
ClaimBuster	22720	I know he wants to disown it.	1
ClaimBuster	22721	That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.	1
ClaimBuster	22722	My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America.	0
ClaimBuster	22723	Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	22724	I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties.	1
ClaimBuster	22725	Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	22726	Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	22727	I'm going to tell you Americans we'll get to work right away and we'll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that's what America has been doing.	0
ClaimBuster	22728	Lincoln called this country the last best hope of man on earth.	1
ClaimBuster	22729	There was a time when there was hope for those who uh - were poor and downtrodden and who were - uh elderly or who were - uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone.	0
ClaimBuster	22730	We're ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied.	0
ClaimBuster	22731	The whole problem came up in 1984.	1
ClaimBuster	22732	And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.	1
ClaimBuster	22733	All history tells us that that's a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	22734	I look up and see the Soviet flag on the moon.	0
ClaimBuster	22735	They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.	0
ClaimBuster	22736	I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.	1
ClaimBuster	22737	We have enough problems in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	22738	I'm not going to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	22739	That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.	1
ClaimBuster	22740	Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	22741	And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job.	0
ClaimBuster	22742	My grandfather died a while back.	1
ClaimBuster	22743	We've got the plan announced for what we can do for small business.	1
ClaimBuster	22744	No preferences to unqualified people, no quotas, but don't give up on making an extra effort until you're sure everybody has a chance to prove they're qualified.	0
ClaimBuster	22745	I don't want to cost jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	22746	Our schools are getting better, and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level.	0
ClaimBuster	22747	He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax.	1
ClaimBuster	22748	This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	22749	That's what brings jobs in.	0
ClaimBuster	22750	And we're on the track on this one.	0
ClaimBuster	22751	But it is certainly my responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	22752	Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated.	0
ClaimBuster	22753	I put my wallet on the table for you and your children.	1
ClaimBuster	22754	Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions.	0
ClaimBuster	22755	We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	22756	Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.	1
ClaimBuster	22757	Not only ships couldn't, but I'd say companies that are moving their oil can't, people who are trading in their oil can't.	0
ClaimBuster	22758	We've got to proceed very carefully on that.	0
ClaimBuster	22759	It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program.	1
ClaimBuster	22760	Now the United States, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the uh - People's Republic of China sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula.	1
ClaimBuster	22761	I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.	0
ClaimBuster	22762	You can look at our tax returns.	0
ClaimBuster	22763	It has to have accountability and oversight.	0
ClaimBuster	22764	This country desperately needs a jobs program, and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated.	0
ClaimBuster	22765	He was criticizing President Reagan.	1
ClaimBuster	22766	I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.	0
ClaimBuster	22767	But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law.	0
ClaimBuster	22768	The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated.	1
ClaimBuster	22769	I will never cede the authority of our country or our security to any other nation.	0
ClaimBuster	22770	I'm glad you clarified that.	0
ClaimBuster	22771	But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.	0
ClaimBuster	22772	Now, the President spoke a moment ago about that I was against the minimum wage.	1
ClaimBuster	22773	Now I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations.	0
ClaimBuster	22774	So this comes from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	22775	We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that's number one.	0
ClaimBuster	22776	I respect his right to disagree with me.	0
ClaimBuster	22777	The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility.	0
ClaimBuster	22778	That's why I proposed a hydrogen automobile -- hydrogen-generated automobile.	1
ClaimBuster	22779	Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all.	1
ClaimBuster	22780	Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining.	0
ClaimBuster	22781	Our airports are like from a third world country.	0
ClaimBuster	22782	We need to have rewards.	0
ClaimBuster	22783	The president also took Medicare, which belongs to you.	1
ClaimBuster	22784	Number two, keep working with the states, as we are now, to add 2.2 million more people to the insurance system.	0
ClaimBuster	22785	Let me talk about tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	22786	Going back 23 years, I don't know, Helen.	0
ClaimBuster	22787	The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.	1
ClaimBuster	22788	Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?	0
ClaimBuster	22789	I think it's very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it.	0
ClaimBuster	22790	"As George Will said the other day, ""Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now."""	1
ClaimBuster	22791	Of course, I've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I'm not going to spread his wealth around.	1
ClaimBuster	22792	Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make.	0
ClaimBuster	22793	Seventy-two other nations have been able to do it.	1
ClaimBuster	22794	We've got to pay it back.	0
ClaimBuster	22795	Who would write the prayer?	0
ClaimBuster	22796	We should have more debates.	0
ClaimBuster	22797	The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.	1
ClaimBuster	22798	It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then.	1
ClaimBuster	22799	So, I can only tell you about the manual -- that we're not in the habit of assigning guilt before there has been proper evidence produced and proof of that guilt.	0
ClaimBuster	22800	And he has made the point that you have not repudiated some of the semidiplomatic activity of the Reverend Jackson, particularly in Central America.	1
ClaimBuster	22801	Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	22802	We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness.	0
ClaimBuster	22803	It's kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue.	0
ClaimBuster	22804	I want to help those with disabilities fit into the mainstream.	0
ClaimBuster	22805	Let me tell you why.	0
ClaimBuster	22806	"He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers ""people who aren't captured."""	1
ClaimBuster	22807	But we shouldn't have been there in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	22808	Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid.	0
ClaimBuster	22809	I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.	0
ClaimBuster	22810	If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.	0
ClaimBuster	22811	A President must manage that budget.	0
ClaimBuster	22812	And it has got to be brought under control.	0
ClaimBuster	22813	Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there's some indications that by the time the next president's term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war.	0
ClaimBuster	22814	We haven't seen the language yet.	1
ClaimBuster	22815	Now, I say whose country is this?	0
ClaimBuster	22816	And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.	1
ClaimBuster	22817	States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states.	0
ClaimBuster	22818	I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.	0
ClaimBuster	22819	But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.	0
ClaimBuster	22820	I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.	0
ClaimBuster	22821	If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.	0
ClaimBuster	22822	Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job.	0
ClaimBuster	22823	I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act.	1
ClaimBuster	22824	When -- when he was asked would class size...	0
ClaimBuster	22825	And that launched a campaign to try to get the record companies to put ratings that -- warning labels for parents.	1
ClaimBuster	22826	Just the ground rules here.	0
ClaimBuster	22827	When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt, now $16 trillion in debt.	1
ClaimBuster	22828	Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	22829	And I think I did a good job.	0
ClaimBuster	22830	I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones.	0
ClaimBuster	22831	He's said that it's been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat.	1
ClaimBuster	22832	And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief.	0
ClaimBuster	22833	The facts are after my plan, the wealthiest of Americans pay more taxes of the percentage of the whole than they do today.	1
ClaimBuster	22834	Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs.	1
ClaimBuster	22835	There are 43 million of us.	1
ClaimBuster	22836	And that's been lacking in the last eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	22837	It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed.	1
ClaimBuster	22838	And I only want to say that however good the record is, it's got to be better.	0
ClaimBuster	22839	I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.	0
ClaimBuster	22840	And there's one going on right now, which we don't know about it.	1
ClaimBuster	22841	It's a $500 per child tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	22842	Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?	0
ClaimBuster	22843	I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.	1
ClaimBuster	22844	But those are not the things that count.	0
ClaimBuster	22845	We -- we had to go into Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	22846	Over the last ten years since he's been governor, they're 30% behind, 30% -- they're 30% of the national average.	1
ClaimBuster	22847	So let's talk about this.	0
ClaimBuster	22848	Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money.	1
ClaimBuster	22849	I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening.	0
ClaimBuster	22850	In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government.	1
ClaimBuster	22851	Some of them have been Democrats and some of them have been Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	22852	There are other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper.	0
ClaimBuster	22853	As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend.	1
ClaimBuster	22854	So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.	1
ClaimBuster	22855	And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts.	0
ClaimBuster	22856	Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent.	0
ClaimBuster	22857	I came to Washington to solve problems.	1
ClaimBuster	22858	Not reducing the interest -	0
ClaimBuster	22859	And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this.	1
ClaimBuster	22860	It is being blocked by the Republican leadership in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	22861	How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children.	0
ClaimBuster	22862	Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too.	0
ClaimBuster	22863	The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didn't want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure.	1
ClaimBuster	22864	But if you just want to keep the music going, just stay traditional this next time around, and 4 years from now you'll have everybody blaming everybody else for a bad health care system.	0
ClaimBuster	22865	The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.	0
ClaimBuster	22866	And I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.	0
ClaimBuster	22867	But I said they have to focus on terror, also.	1
ClaimBuster	22868	Number two, we're going to increase our trade.	0
ClaimBuster	22869	For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to.	0
ClaimBuster	22870	Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife, President Reagan's press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn't fight for the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	22871	I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.	1
ClaimBuster	22872	In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you've seen crime go down.	1
ClaimBuster	22873	I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	22874	And it's Katherine Fenton, who has a question for you.	0
ClaimBuster	22875	We ought to put the homeowners first.	0
ClaimBuster	22876	Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?	0
ClaimBuster	22877	I think those are very very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review.	0
ClaimBuster	22878	So we're already beginning to see progress.	1
ClaimBuster	22879	We passed landmark legislation in '84.	1
ClaimBuster	22880	And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher.	0
ClaimBuster	22881	It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year.	1
ClaimBuster	22882	This sounds like real progress here, because we've had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base.	0
ClaimBuster	22883	We haven't done that yet.	0
ClaimBuster	22884	Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	22885	I'm just telling you our state comes together to do what is right.	0
ClaimBuster	22886	I just have to correct the record.	0
ClaimBuster	22887	That we must cut back.	0
ClaimBuster	22888	The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world.	0
ClaimBuster	22889	What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country.	0
ClaimBuster	22890	It's causing high interest rates.	0
ClaimBuster	22891	And I -- and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	22892	That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.	0
ClaimBuster	22893	Now, I have set as strong an example as I can, then at that point when we sit down over at Capitol Hill -- tomorrow night I'm going to be talking about government reform -- it's a long subject, you wouldn't let me finish tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	22894	Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.	1
ClaimBuster	22895	And when I stood up there and spoke to the Congress, I was speaking off the same intelligence he looked at to make his decisions to support the authorization of force.	1
ClaimBuster	22896	I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	22897	I once said, in a frivolous moment, when he got out of the race: If you can't stand the heat, buy an air conditioning company.	1
ClaimBuster	22898	Maybe you put off buying a new car.	0
ClaimBuster	22899	What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.	0
ClaimBuster	22900	He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.	1
ClaimBuster	22901	I've got reply on that.	0
ClaimBuster	22902	Take it out of politics.	0
ClaimBuster	22903	But it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed.	1
ClaimBuster	22904	Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	22905	Who has the perseverance, the character, the integrity, the maturity, to get the job done?	0
ClaimBuster	22906	I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need.	0
ClaimBuster	22907	But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased.	1
ClaimBuster	22908	If I had it to do over again I might answer the questions a little better.	0
ClaimBuster	22909	Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something I'm supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that.	0
ClaimBuster	22910	Now, I think that it's very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time.	0
ClaimBuster	22911	And we have to be very vigilant.	0
ClaimBuster	22912	I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.	0
ClaimBuster	22913	Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?	0
ClaimBuster	22914	This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it's also how we're going to save the federal budget, because we can't afford these escalating costs.	0
ClaimBuster	22915	It's one way to help reduce abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	22916	I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?	0
ClaimBuster	22917	The people deserve that since we have to pick up the tab; you got the PAC money, we'll pay the tab.	0
ClaimBuster	22918	If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want -- I don't want to empower somebody like that.	0
ClaimBuster	22919	I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women.	0
ClaimBuster	22920	There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	22921	It's a contract between generations.	0
ClaimBuster	22922	These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	22923	He was deceiving the inspectors.	1
ClaimBuster	22924	Well, it would be if they're given special protective status.	0
ClaimBuster	22925	They have to help us out.	0
ClaimBuster	22926	Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.	0
ClaimBuster	22927	I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it.	0
ClaimBuster	22928	I disagree, strongly disagree with that.	0
ClaimBuster	22929	And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.	1
ClaimBuster	22930	And NAFTA doesn't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.	1
ClaimBuster	22931	By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.	1
ClaimBuster	22932	And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast.	1
ClaimBuster	22933	I also had a program starting last year.	1
ClaimBuster	22934	We've made some progress during the last eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	22935	And he's kept his head up.	0
ClaimBuster	22936	And thank you for tuning in this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	22937	And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	22938	I'm not interested in his character.	0
ClaimBuster	22939	I think you have to take on medical fraud.	0
ClaimBuster	22940	And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	22941	I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.	1
ClaimBuster	22942	First of all, the world is still a dangerous and uncertain place.	0
ClaimBuster	22943	I'm concerned that we're overdeployed around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	22944	In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.	1
ClaimBuster	22945	Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one.	0
ClaimBuster	22946	That there is some resentment of U.S. power.	0
ClaimBuster	22947	The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.	1
ClaimBuster	22948	We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.	1
ClaimBuster	22949	We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.	0
ClaimBuster	22950	We don't have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level.	0
ClaimBuster	22951	In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation?	1
ClaimBuster	22952	Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he's in - been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office.	1
ClaimBuster	22953	If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.	0
ClaimBuster	22954	Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.	0
ClaimBuster	22955	Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.	0
ClaimBuster	22956	When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.	1
ClaimBuster	22957	We've got to recruit 100,000 new teachers.	0
ClaimBuster	22958	And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.	1
ClaimBuster	22959	I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they'll look at those projects.	0
ClaimBuster	22960	But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	22961	It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.	0
ClaimBuster	22962	But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.	0
ClaimBuster	22963	And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.	0
ClaimBuster	22964	Her name is Alicia Machado.	1
ClaimBuster	22965	This president thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security.	1
ClaimBuster	22966	To me that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	22967	Mr. President, countries are leaving the coalition, not joining.	1
ClaimBuster	22968	And we need to fix a lot of the problems.	0
ClaimBuster	22969	I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely we'll ever have to use troops.	0
ClaimBuster	22970	And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.	1
ClaimBuster	22971	So I want to make sure that we make -- we make America more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	22972	But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	22973	If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that's a home run for me.	0
ClaimBuster	22974	Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence.	0
ClaimBuster	22975	And private insurers have to make a profit.	0
ClaimBuster	22976	And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	22977	And therefore I want to rebuild the military power.	0
ClaimBuster	22978	In spite of his policies.	0
ClaimBuster	22979	Got four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.	0
ClaimBuster	22980	We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with -- with Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	22981	It's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.	1
ClaimBuster	22982	Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.	1
ClaimBuster	22983	Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	22984	And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.	1
ClaimBuster	22985	But Governor Clinton refuses to touch that, simply refuses.	1
ClaimBuster	22986	And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.	0
ClaimBuster	22987	I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.	1
ClaimBuster	22988	And last week when we were trying to get the Export Administration Act through the Congress - necessary legislation - my administration went to Capitol Hill and tried to convince the House and the Senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who uh - participate or cooperate with the Arab uh boycott.	1
ClaimBuster	22989	And the result is our forces today are overextended.	0
ClaimBuster	22990	I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.	0
ClaimBuster	22991	The world is more dangerous today because the president didn't make the right judgments.	0
ClaimBuster	22992	And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.	0
ClaimBuster	22993	In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Pakistan, Angola, Watergate, CIA, we've been hurt.	0
ClaimBuster	22994	Well -- well, but she said one thing.	0
ClaimBuster	22995	I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have.	0
ClaimBuster	22996	So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.	1
ClaimBuster	22997	I wouldn't violate anything my mother said.	0
ClaimBuster	22998	So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.	0
ClaimBuster	22999	It will come from the pockets of the people.	0
ClaimBuster	23000	They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.	1
ClaimBuster	23001	So it's easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but it's important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president.	0
ClaimBuster	23002	And how do we expect to be able to implement those?	0
ClaimBuster	23003	They will want to do what's good for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	23004	Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President.	1
ClaimBuster	23005	If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business.	0
ClaimBuster	23006	"We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. """	1
ClaimBuster	23007	He raised a whole bunch of them.	0
ClaimBuster	23008	That's why I'm so strong for accountability.	0
ClaimBuster	23009	It was locker room talk, as I told you.	1
ClaimBuster	23010	We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate.	0
ClaimBuster	23011	And it's going to take discipline of the executive branch; it's going to take discipline of the congressional branch.	0
ClaimBuster	23012	But again, we have a big difference on child care, for example.	0
ClaimBuster	23013	People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies.	1
ClaimBuster	23014	Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis.	0
ClaimBuster	23015	Colin Powell will be on somebody's ticket 4 years from now -- right?	0
ClaimBuster	23016	He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.	0
ClaimBuster	23017	So I believe America's less safe.	0
ClaimBuster	23018	Now, if later on after a period of time we find that Social Security is in trouble, we'll pull together the top experts of the country.	0
ClaimBuster	23019	There is no question that the poor are worse off.	0
ClaimBuster	23020	The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.	1
ClaimBuster	23021	But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are.	1
ClaimBuster	23022	I was going to applaud, too.	0
ClaimBuster	23023	One last point on the missiles.	0
ClaimBuster	23024	But let me talk back about where we've been.	0
ClaimBuster	23025	I proposed one to the Congress two years ago, encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal -- to use coal and gas.	1
ClaimBuster	23026	You took General Motors bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	23027	And this is something Republicans have used for a long time.	1
ClaimBuster	23028	We're No.1 in automobile manufacturing production and sales around the world again, the first time since 1970s.	1
ClaimBuster	23029	I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about.	0
ClaimBuster	23030	And nobody's going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly.	0
ClaimBuster	23031	Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization.	1
ClaimBuster	23032	I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted.	0
ClaimBuster	23033	And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act.	0
ClaimBuster	23034	But nobody called Sean Hannity.	1
ClaimBuster	23035	This is the kind of record that's there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn't go.	0
ClaimBuster	23036	The only thing I believe is that whatever the - the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh - incident occurred.	0
ClaimBuster	23037	We are not at war.	1
ClaimBuster	23038	I don't think we should spend tax money on private schools.	0
ClaimBuster	23039	So we've got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	23040	It's a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	23041	We're all focused on China.	0
ClaimBuster	23042	And we have to stop the violence.	0
ClaimBuster	23043	We're 9 million jobs short of that.	1
ClaimBuster	23044	Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies.	0
ClaimBuster	23045	The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	23046	It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government.	1
ClaimBuster	23047	We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action.	0
ClaimBuster	23048	We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran, that might be of a warlike nature.	0
ClaimBuster	23049	I uh - believe, however, a comment ought to be made about the direction of the uh - Burger Court, vis-a-vis the uh - court uh - that preceded it.	0
ClaimBuster	23050	Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy.	1
ClaimBuster	23051	I think that is the wrong choice.	0
ClaimBuster	23052	I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology.	0
ClaimBuster	23053	That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and -- and earn a living for their family.	0
ClaimBuster	23054	Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue.	1
ClaimBuster	23055	We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months.	1
ClaimBuster	23056	It does not happen that the church that I belong to had that as part of its dogma.	1
ClaimBuster	23057	And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.	0
ClaimBuster	23058	But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver of our deficits right now.	0
ClaimBuster	23059	Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes.	0
ClaimBuster	23060	If you like your high premiums, you keep them.	0
ClaimBuster	23061	I think it might have been one of my opponent's ads.	0
ClaimBuster	23062	It may be Republican, it may be Democratic.	0
ClaimBuster	23063	But let me just say to America: I am not proposing a government-run program.	0
ClaimBuster	23064	It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	23065	And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at.	0
ClaimBuster	23066	I was honored to speak to those troops.	0
ClaimBuster	23067	So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.	1
ClaimBuster	23068	A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said we've got to reregulate, and nothing happened.	1
ClaimBuster	23069	And that's what Osama bin Laden's handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan.	1
ClaimBuster	23070	The Economist magazine polled lots of economists, seven Nobel prize winners who said if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts, 40 percent, in the environment and law enforcement and education.	1
ClaimBuster	23071	We can't afford that kind of growth in federal spending.	0
ClaimBuster	23072	And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.	1
ClaimBuster	23073	It all sounds to me like you're going to have some government setting price.	0
ClaimBuster	23074	You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically six months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped.	1
ClaimBuster	23075	See, Willow Run could be converted from cars to airplanes in World War II because it was here.	1
ClaimBuster	23076	But I -- I couldn't do that.	0
ClaimBuster	23077	They shouldn't misuse their bench.	0
ClaimBuster	23078	We're selling Japanese rice from California for the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	23079	I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't.	0
ClaimBuster	23080	He's been in the United States Senate 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	23081	And it's a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up, recognizing that you can't legislate morality.	0
ClaimBuster	23082	And let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about.	0
ClaimBuster	23083	Well, how about this for a government reform policy?	0
ClaimBuster	23084	And I know it's necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	23085	As a matter of fact, there has been less than one-quarter of 1 percent of foreclosures of the 270,000 loans from government that the farmers have.	1
ClaimBuster	23086	In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.	0
ClaimBuster	23087	And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem.	0
ClaimBuster	23088	But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.	0
ClaimBuster	23089	Are you for it without quotas?	0
ClaimBuster	23090	Help me pass these programs.	0
ClaimBuster	23091	Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	23092	And you've got to be firm and consistent.	0
ClaimBuster	23093	Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we've got the most highly skilled workforce.	1
ClaimBuster	23094	I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.	0
ClaimBuster	23095	And so let's look at our records as well as our rhetoric.	0
ClaimBuster	23096	But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption.	1
ClaimBuster	23097	Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.	1
ClaimBuster	23098	Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.	0
ClaimBuster	23099	It's not about President Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	23100	It starts with making sure every child learns to read.	0
ClaimBuster	23101	You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue?	1
ClaimBuster	23102	We can't leave a failed Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	23103	As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	23104	When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day.	0
ClaimBuster	23105	I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system - to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.	0
ClaimBuster	23106	I don't want to hear them.	0
ClaimBuster	23107	Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don't go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	23108	It's what the federal government does to you.	0
ClaimBuster	23109	We should have been much tougher on trade even then.	0
ClaimBuster	23110	There's another group that I feel very close to, and these at the men and women who fought on the battlefield, the children -- the families -- of the ones who died and the people who left parts of their bodies over there.	0
ClaimBuster	23111	Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba.	1
ClaimBuster	23112	You didn't do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	23113	And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress.	0
ClaimBuster	23114	This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	23115	If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed.	0
ClaimBuster	23116	This is the most religious, great country in history.	0
ClaimBuster	23117	I have never heard a candidate for President, who is a Republican, quote a Republican president, but when they get in office, they try to govern like Republicans.	0
ClaimBuster	23118	But I have tremendous respect for women.	0
ClaimBuster	23119	I do not want any more trickle down government.	0
ClaimBuster	23120	And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	23121	And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.	0
ClaimBuster	23122	Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh - Watergate and uh - the CIA revelations, people have feel - have felt that they've uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh - heat of the campaign - I've been in thirty primaries during the springtime, I've been campaigning for twenty-two months - I've made some mistakes.	1
ClaimBuster	23123	But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided.	0
ClaimBuster	23124	Let's talk about the programs.	0
ClaimBuster	23125	Do you want jobs in the inner city?	0
ClaimBuster	23126	Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.	0
ClaimBuster	23127	We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.	1
ClaimBuster	23128	But we had also better be darn sure we don't leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	23129	Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	23130	I think the General Motors thing is very relevant.	0
ClaimBuster	23131	And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?	0
ClaimBuster	23132	A President must know those things.	0
ClaimBuster	23133	And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	23134	Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union.	1
ClaimBuster	23135	Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated.	0
ClaimBuster	23136	We busted the 4th largest army, and we did it through leadership.	1
ClaimBuster	23137	So let me try to answer you in this way.	0
ClaimBuster	23138	They're the fundamental aspect of America's economy.	0
ClaimBuster	23139	I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities.	1
ClaimBuster	23140	I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose?	1
ClaimBuster	23141	When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	23142	I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we don't think that comparison is appropriate.	1
ClaimBuster	23143	That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.	1
ClaimBuster	23144	They are now 27.5 miles per gallon per automobile fleet.	1
ClaimBuster	23145	Last week I broke up -- I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the President's summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today.	1
ClaimBuster	23146	I've been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow.	0
ClaimBuster	23147	I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.	0
ClaimBuster	23148	You keep your own doctor.	1
ClaimBuster	23149	And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	23150	No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.	0
ClaimBuster	23151	Of course, we're going to find Osama bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	23152	I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever.	0
ClaimBuster	23153	He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	23154	And it's a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people.	0
ClaimBuster	23155	We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.	1
ClaimBuster	23156	And those pessimists who say it can't be done, I'm sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them	0
ClaimBuster	23157	Well, Governor Romney's right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	23158	Now the Republican platform will cost more too.	0
ClaimBuster	23159	Like Jerry Brown, the 800 number.	1
ClaimBuster	23160	I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money.	0
ClaimBuster	23161	This is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country.	1
ClaimBuster	23162	Starting when they're 3 and going to this school until they're 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade.	0
ClaimBuster	23163	Now, what happened in July we've covered again and again and again.	1
ClaimBuster	23164	Your doctor chooses your prescription.	1
ClaimBuster	23165	The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way.	0
ClaimBuster	23166	It's not driven by members of Congress, and what they would like to see.	0
ClaimBuster	23167	I've kept the faith with my country.	0
ClaimBuster	23168	Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.	1
ClaimBuster	23169	And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.	0
ClaimBuster	23170	And I'll tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired.	0
ClaimBuster	23171	"""I said, ""OK, you've got a deal."	1
ClaimBuster	23172	I think it's whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the people's ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think it's a question of values, not likability or loveability, it's a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because you'd know exactly how to begin.	0
ClaimBuster	23173	And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose, is ludicrous, in my judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	23174	There are some things I don't understand.	0
ClaimBuster	23175	And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- Al Qaida and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion.	1
ClaimBuster	23176	It's a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks.	0
ClaimBuster	23177	In the first place, never go back to that Democratic grain embargo, that liberal Democrat grain embargo that knocked the markets right out from under us and made Mr. Gorbachev say to me when I was here, how do I know you're reliable suppliers?	1
ClaimBuster	23178	And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him.	0
ClaimBuster	23179	And I'm sorry, but demonstrating -- it's not a question of patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	23180	"The president is the one that said, ""We can't allow countries to get nuclear weapons."""	1
ClaimBuster	23181	Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.	1
ClaimBuster	23182	At the same time, we have to be prepared.	0
ClaimBuster	23183	It's against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly.	1
ClaimBuster	23184	We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them.	1
ClaimBuster	23185	And you look at our miners.	0
ClaimBuster	23186	And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.	0
ClaimBuster	23187	$90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers.	1
ClaimBuster	23188	I want to see more vouchers.	0
ClaimBuster	23189	And that means that there will be more industrial activity.	0
ClaimBuster	23190	You're running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research.	1
ClaimBuster	23191	Let me start with how to control the cost of health care: medical liability reform, for starters, which he's opposed.	1
ClaimBuster	23192	So I would say our prestige is not so high.	0
ClaimBuster	23193	Iran is moving toward nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.	1
ClaimBuster	23194	We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold.	0
ClaimBuster	23195	Did I get that right?	0
ClaimBuster	23196	We're a country that owes $20 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	23197	And even some in your own party couldn't buy that.	0
ClaimBuster	23198	We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again.	0
ClaimBuster	23199	And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	23200	We've got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them.	0
ClaimBuster	23201	We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.	0
ClaimBuster	23202	We went out and built housing.	1
ClaimBuster	23203	Young folks saying I'm going to do something good for my country.	0
ClaimBuster	23204	It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.	0
ClaimBuster	23205	Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet.	0
ClaimBuster	23206	One last point I should make.	0
ClaimBuster	23207	And that was the serious, serious threat.	0
ClaimBuster	23208	We have a duty to defeat this enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	23209	Now, we have allocated $750 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	23210	Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense.	0
ClaimBuster	23211	We're going to make America great.	0
ClaimBuster	23212	Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations.	1
ClaimBuster	23213	Well, it was very -- I say nothing.	0
ClaimBuster	23214	How about a line item veto?	0
ClaimBuster	23215	For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, you're automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college.	1
ClaimBuster	23216	The money stays within the Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	23217	-- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	23218	We've got to show moral support for Georgia.	0
ClaimBuster	23219	We've had some disagreements about that.	1
ClaimBuster	23220	We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.	1
ClaimBuster	23221	This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	23222	Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no, to -- to -- to folks both in your own party and in the other party.	0
ClaimBuster	23223	Your question was on fairness.	0
ClaimBuster	23224	I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.	0
ClaimBuster	23225	Well, we all make mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	23226	But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.	0
ClaimBuster	23227	So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare.	1
ClaimBuster	23228	How can we build a strong America militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt?	0
ClaimBuster	23229	Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	23230	Whether we're going to move a million people from welfare to work.	0
ClaimBuster	23231	But thank goodness we've always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union.	0
ClaimBuster	23232	And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services.	1
ClaimBuster	23233	I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war.	0
ClaimBuster	23234	The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	23235	We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if we're smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	23236	As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.	1
ClaimBuster	23237	Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion.	0
ClaimBuster	23238	So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.	0
ClaimBuster	23239	And that is the current campaign financing system.	0
ClaimBuster	23240	We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power.	0
ClaimBuster	23241	Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.	0
ClaimBuster	23242	But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	23243	And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.	0
ClaimBuster	23244	The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	23245	It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.	1
ClaimBuster	23246	When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	23247	I want to give a special thanks to my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America.	0
ClaimBuster	23248	That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.	0
ClaimBuster	23249	That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.	0
ClaimBuster	23250	And our best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	23251	No, I don't have an answer for everything.	0
ClaimBuster	23252	And therefore, when they have to try to purchase drugs they do so on their own, there's no kind of collective bargaining, no power of purchasing among seniors.	0
ClaimBuster	23253	I've had some arguments with him about the speed in which we might have lowered interest rates, but Governor Clinton, he talks about the reaction to the markets.	0
ClaimBuster	23254	We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.	0
ClaimBuster	23255	And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally.	0
ClaimBuster	23256	Social Security is structurally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	23257	By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth.	0
ClaimBuster	23258	We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests.	0
ClaimBuster	23259	Senator Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that.	1
ClaimBuster	23260	But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.	0
ClaimBuster	23261	I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade.	0
ClaimBuster	23262	I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	23263	This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	23264	Well, if you'll turn on the television, as I -- I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.	1
ClaimBuster	23265	But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US.	0
ClaimBuster	23266	I volunteered for the Army.	1
ClaimBuster	23267	It also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained.	0
ClaimBuster	23268	I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer--a little longer run; it's going to take awhile to educate.	0
ClaimBuster	23269	I don't want to go down the path to Spain.	0
ClaimBuster	23270	And while he's been diverted, with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army, either going to Iraq, coming back from Iraq, or getting ready to go, North Korea's gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.	1
ClaimBuster	23271	If you can't get your act together to pick him up one day when a Panamanian major has kidnapped him and a special forces team is 400 yards away and it's a stroll across the park to get him, and if you can't get your act together, at least pick up the Panamanian major, who they then killed, step up to the plate and admit it was a mistake.	1
ClaimBuster	23272	All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges.	0
ClaimBuster	23273	To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.	0
ClaimBuster	23274	There are all these studies out there.	0
ClaimBuster	23275	You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...	1
ClaimBuster	23276	And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.	0
ClaimBuster	23277	The Commander-in-Chief was organizing demonstrations halfway around the world during another era.	1
ClaimBuster	23278	And I've been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union.	1
ClaimBuster	23279	Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.	1
ClaimBuster	23280	The best expression of my family values is that tonight's my 17th wedding anniversary, and I'd like to close my question by just wishing my wife a happy anniversary, and thank you, my daughter, for being here.	1
ClaimBuster	23281	We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.	0
ClaimBuster	23282	They'll be able to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	23283	Finally, to you students up there -- God bless you, I'm doing this for you: I want you to have the American dream.	0
ClaimBuster	23284	I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways we've been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge.	0
ClaimBuster	23285	He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote with him and lost by one vote.	1
ClaimBuster	23286	So you got to have a judicial intervention.	0
ClaimBuster	23287	While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all 50 states in English, and then also in math.	1
ClaimBuster	23288	A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	23289	It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.	1
ClaimBuster	23290	I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.	0
ClaimBuster	23291	But my strategy is broader than that.	0
ClaimBuster	23292	I've actually passed 56 individual bills that I've personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills.	1
ClaimBuster	23293	And I assume some of those are because of our trading partners.	0
ClaimBuster	23294	I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy, I think it worked, and I'm pleased I took -- made the decision I made.	0
ClaimBuster	23295	And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	23296	Well, I think that, given what's happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region.	0
ClaimBuster	23297	Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.	0
ClaimBuster	23298	Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, jointly, for a commission that closes corporate giveaway loopholes.	1
ClaimBuster	23299	spending - we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed and probably mainly because Mr. Carter's economic policy has built into the next five years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more out of the people's pockets than was taken this year.	0
ClaimBuster	23300	We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	23301	We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.	0
ClaimBuster	23302	And here's what we can do.	0
ClaimBuster	23303	I just -- I think there has been -- some of the scientists, I believe, Mr. Vice President, haven't they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming?	0
ClaimBuster	23304	Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	23305	We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.	0
ClaimBuster	23306	Our country has tremendous problems.	0
ClaimBuster	23307	Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?	0
ClaimBuster	23308	And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	23309	Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand -- brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	23310	That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	23311	Well, I've been a senator, Donald...	1
ClaimBuster	23312	And unfortunately, that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul.	0
ClaimBuster	23313	I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	23314	28 years ago, as a young man just graduated from law school, I came to this city, came clear across the country, to watch John Kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the United States, right here in Los Angeles.	1
ClaimBuster	23315	And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.	1
ClaimBuster	23316	That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.	0
ClaimBuster	23317	Did we have any allies helping?	0
ClaimBuster	23318	I come from West Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	23319	And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology.	0
ClaimBuster	23320	And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy.	1
ClaimBuster	23321	African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.	1
ClaimBuster	23322	If you have a heart problem, you don't wait till a heart attack to address it.	0
ClaimBuster	23323	The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I'm talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	23324	Now I think we have a selective engagement policy.	0
ClaimBuster	23325	For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind.	0
ClaimBuster	23326	And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions.	0
OC	23327	I thought maybe we ' d grab dinner and try to find something fun to do ( which may be hard in Cleveland on a Sunday night , but . . . we can try ! ) . 	0

OC	23403	I hear you more clearly . 	0
OC	23404	I suppose I could agree with you and still go in a slightly different direction : I think stunted passion can drive people to lead lives in which they appear to be passionless . 	1
OC	23405	It ' s not an easy mindset to recall after nearly a decade being out of the closet , but I would say that I spent a good deal of my 20s , when I felt both uncomfortable with my own sexuality and isolated about being who I was , using my drive and my power as an intellectual , emotional , and spiritual being to either route my passion anywhere BUT sex , or to holding myself in . 	0
OC	23406	"In a sense , what the movie gets "" right "" for me happens most clearly with Ennis ' s character : the force of nature of his passion is one he devotes to containing himself , rather than trying to break free . "	0

OC	23408	Does that make any sense ? 	0
OC	23409	Maybe one way I could come at it is nothing more than this : I had a couple of clunky , difficult relationships with women before I came out as a queer man , and I ' ve had a couple of decent relationships with women since coming out , fucking around with a lot of men , and giving my whole heart and soul to a couple of men over the years . 	0

OC	23534	Well , frankly ? 	0

OC	25460	Making feminist arguments at the expense of actual women ' s experiences is , IMO , one of the most significant fracture points within feminism , The reverse is also true : the political is personal . 	0
OC	25461	Mind you , Canada isn ' t perfect , by any means ; another part of why it was possible for me is because my family was supportive - I ' d have been in a much more precarious position if they weren ' t . 	0

OC	25463	( My son ' s father didn ' t even get an opt-in ; he was . . . not very stable - but again , Canadian conditions meant I only had to consider that problem in terms of the personal , weighing fairness to him against what it could mean for my baby if he took it into his head to try for custody . 	0
OC	25464	I ' m pretty sure we ' re at least close to the same page - it ' s partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter ' s father opt out . 	1
OC	25465	( IOW , I think he might be a Nice Guy ( tm ) . ) 	0
OC	25466	What I suspect here is that he has a vested interest in not changing the institutional injustices , because in a just world , women wouldn ' t need men . 	0
OC	25467	"I suspect the latter , because of him bringing up "" pregnancy is so dangerous "" as an argument supporting mandatory support - the only connection I can see between them is that the financial support would mean better health care ( assuming the father , or his parents , have or are able to earn enough to make a difference ) and an improved , but not risk-free , outcome ; otherwise , obligating the father ' s involvement has no effect on those dangers ( or may have a negative effect ) . "	0
OC	25468	I ' m not so sure the KiSA is on your side ; he didn ' t seem to have the slightest interest in the injustices I was trying to talk about - at best , he ' s convinced they ' re immutable ; at worst , he ' s got a hidden agenda . 	1

OC	26162	CNN probably unfairly concluded that blacks overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , but it doesn ' t excuse anyone for voting for prop 8 , because a lot of every race was responsible for its passage . 	0
OC	26163	( Actually , the pro-8 people really really twisted it so bad it made me want to puke . ) 	0
OC	26164	We all know religion was what caused the passage , but my main gripe was that people decided to fall on religion instead of their experience to vote . 	0
OC	26165	But let ' s assume that poll conducted by CNN was severely flawed as speculated . 	0
OC	26166	I was more upset that a majority of people who voted for the issue didn ' t see the measure as an issue of rights and equality for all , just about gay marriage . 	0
OC	26167	Again , expectations were turned upside-down , and that was what upset me the most . 	0
OC	26168	Even the Catholic church made a huge push to support 8 as well , but the Hispanics who are usually very religious only barely supported the measure . 	0
OC	26169	So many good ones to choose from ! 	0
OC	26170	Turns out it was the other way around . 	0

OC	26584	A quick summary is that Apple want the fonts to look nice , whereas Microsoft want the text to be more readable . 	0
OC	26585	After my post a bit earlier in Windows Safari , kurisu posted this fascinating article on the differences between Windows and OS X ( and now Safari for Windows ) font rendering , which has puzzled me for ages . 	0
OC	26586	"I think it ' s fair to say that neither is "" better "" , but it ' s interesting to see the way the different approaches go . "	1
OC	26587	So far we ' ve watched Seasons 1 , 2 and 7 . 	0
OC	26588	Season 7 was amazing ! 	1
OC	26589	We are trying to catch up on Survivor before watching this current season of Heroes vs Villains to really appreciate who all these people are . 	0
OC	26590	Unfortunately , I had only seen 14-19 and Matt had only seasons 18 & 19 . 	0
OC	26591	We can get seasons 11-now on itunes . 	0
OC	26592	But what about seasons 3-6 ? 	0
OC	26593	There are so many great people with intense ( good & bad ) personalities , crazy challenges , big surprises and it ' s all pirate themed . 	0
OC	26594	And allowing men to skip out entirely on responsibility for their offspring leaves single moms in the lurch . 	0
OC	26595	I can find them online for free but the quality is TERRIBLE ! 	0
OC	26596	Anyone know where I can get seasons 3-6 that isn ' t a choppy , garbley mess with a giant logo slapped over a huge part of it ? 	0
OC	26597	The only good thing about this whole nightmare is seeing how loving and selfless people are being towards the victims of this fire . 	0
OC	26598	And that doesn ' t even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 ' s . 	0
OC	26599	It ' s one thing to not understand what you ' ve never experienced , it ' s another thing entirely to disdain what you don ' t understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over . 	0
OC	26600	You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L . A . or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story . . . and if you ' ve never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die . . . then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story . 	0
OC	26601	"The story of "" Brokeback Mountain "" is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says "" Oh , Bob--I LOVE YOU ! "" and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying "" THIS IS A LOVE STORY . . . YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . "" "	1
OC	26602	"And while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the "" ivory tower "" . "	1
OC	26603	I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein--he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear . 	0
OC	26604	"They are happy to be urban--and urbane- - "" queers "" of 2005 , and they never presume to "" lower themselves "" to understand lives that are different from their own . . . very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population . . . as "" W "" has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life . "	1
OC	26605	That is the big problem with blowhards like them- - they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men . . . therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them . 	0
OC	26606	I ' m pretty numb right now and trying to stay that way so I don ' t have a meltdown . 	0
OC	26607	But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted . . . and depression , too . 	1
OC	26608	It ' s a love story alright . . . but it ' s a tragedy , too . . . passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that can ' t be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love . 	0

OC	27673	Christ ' s admonitions on divorce were really a way to prevent women from being abandoned by their husbands , and leaving families without livelihoods . 	0
OC	27674	If you continue to live in sin though , you haven ' t repented so you can ' t gain grace . 	0
OC	27675	Well you can repent of a sin , and then live in grace . 	1
OC	27676	And it gets more complicated of course , because some Protestants believe that salvation is through faith alone , some through faith and acts , and some still even believe in Pre-Destination , which means either you ' re on the list or your not and nothing you do in this life has a bearing on that . 	1
OC	27677	Protestants don ' t have that option , because they don ' t believe their preachers stand in for God , and so they don ' t have the power to absolve . 	0

OC	28308	My argument is just that it is hypocritical to punish homosexuals for being unrepentant sinners but allow divorced people off the hook . 	0
OC	28309	Christ didn ' t say anything about homosexuals but he was quite explicit about divorce . 	0
OC	28310	The issue seems to be that giving social status in the Church to unrepentant sinners would encourage sin by setting a bad example . 	0

OC	28523	Sometimes the arguments are so devoid of intelligence , or I ' ve heard them so many times before , that there ' s no reward in refuting them , but if the other side is willing to engage , then having to explain myself and not getting any free passes means that the argument gets a good workout . 	0

OC	29386	Dude , you are not just barking up the wrong tree , your mellow-yet-professional , probably New Age , yoga-teaching ass is barking up about three different wrong trees simultaneously . 	0

OC	29401	That only describes a fraction of the overall group . 	0
OC	29402	In Germany , single motherhood is less common than in the U . S . - people are less delusional about sex and birth control . 	0
OC	29403	But up until recently , anyway , going on welfare as a single mother was not terribly stigmatized . 	0
OC	29404	The German social safety net has been progressively undermined over the past few years , so I have to think that this option is getting harder - they have a lot more emphasis on working to earn one ' s benefits , which is obviously a problem if you have little ones . 	0
OC	29405	( Germany ' s public daycare system is also being slowly de-funded . ) 	0

OC	29432	You can ' t really have that kind of set-up though , but a small office might get you pretty close . . . 	0
OC	29433	In a small office where my boss is my dad and I know the accountant pretty well , and I talk to the same fifteen subcontractors on the phone , it ' s not an overly social environment like most other jobs I ' ve had have been ( which is probably the main reason I don ' t have a rapidly developing ulcer right now ) , so I don ' t have to be that outgoing . 	0
OC	29434	About the job thing , I ' ve always just faked outgoing-ness . 	0

OC	29449	 Nope--can ' t happen to me . . .  	0

VG	31251	There are two real reason I started a couple of forums and they are both related to my former addiction to alcohol . 	0
VG	31252	The above is really some background first off . 	0
VG	31253	However when the problem took hold , the demise to my job and my health also began . 	0
VG	31254	Prior to having a problem I was a UK highly respected IT Consultant and was very successful . 	0
VG	31255	My health had suffered to the point where any job that I used to do was impossible as I am not allowed to drive due to seizures . 	0
VG	31256	Since getting over it nearly a year and a half ago now I had to decide what to do . 	0
VG	31257	The first was to find something to do with an aweful lot of spare time and to make some money ( cant live on freah air ) and so the original Parkweb Oracle site was launched and although it wasnt the kind of money I was used to it is enough to comfortable survive . 	1
VG	31258	But like I said 2 reasons . 	0
VG	31259	I wanted to give a little back to all of the people that helped me and stood by me through my addiction - I made a promise to them all when I was back on my feet so to speak I would do something to try and make a difference . 	0
VG	31260	The second reason is a little deeper . 	0
VG	31261	The atmosphere is different , or , at least , might be different C . Perelman , L . Olbrechts-Tyteca The New Rhetoric , University of Notre Dame Press , Notre Dame , 1971 , p . 285 	0
VG	31262	Hence it can be maintained that the nationalization of a concern , or even of a whole industrial branch , is not a socialistic measure since the rest of the economy continues to be based on the principle of private initiative and of the market economy since the nationalized branch is itself subject to the discipline of the market , particularly by paying its way by means of sales rather than by means of subsidies from the state . 	1
VG	31263	The only point we want to stress is that , between a socialized economy and one certain branches of which have been nationalized , there is more than a quantitative difference . 	0
VG	31264	At such a juncture , we need a lot of money for reaching the people and putting forth our ideas when we are contesting the elections . 	1

VG	31266	Thus initiating military action against Iraq is not a simple matter of honouring clear treaty obligations ( as in 1939 ; the case can be made , though with some awkwardness , for the first Gulf conflict ) , nor of rebutting direct aggression , territorial or economic or whatever , against ourselves . 	1
VG	31267	Strategy reorganised itself around a balance of terror , Mutually Assured Destruction . 	0
VG	31268	The post-Cold War period may have seen the dissolution of this strategic assumption ; but it has not taken us back to the age when nation states fought territorial campaigns . 	0
VG	31269	Hiroshima was the start of a process leading to the development of weaponry that made territorial struggles irrelevant . 	0
VG	31270	The long-distance delivery of weapons of mass destruction altered the character of war itself . 	0
VG	31271	The fact that the war was finally won in the East by tactics that had nothing to do with this ( the atomic bomb ) doesn ' t alter the circumstances in which the war began . 	0
VG	31272	It might , though , make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different . 	0
VG	31273	On the first aspect : the conflict that we undertook ( rightly , I believe ) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory . 	0
VG	31274	Both sides could ( and did ) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment ; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert , the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance . 	0

WD	32695	However , I think that the evaluation / decision needs to weigh the impact that inclusion will have on the class as a whole . . . not just whether it ' s good for that one child . . . . because , imo , inclusion to benefit 1 at the expense of others is wrong . 	1
WD	32696	Public school teachers make more money than private school teachers . 	0
WD	32697	I understand & support the desire of parents to have their dcs , regardless of abilities ( high or low ) , in the most beneficial educational environment possible and I know that I made some broad statements / gave examples that obviously doesn ' t apply to every inclusion situation . 	0

WD	32706	In addition he adds that single-sex education for boys would allow adequate time for male maturation and would benefit the boys by giving them more structure and discipline due to their tendencies of restlessness and aggression ( Mael , 1998 ) It seems clear that single-sex education advocates have done their research and that it does make sense that girls and boys being separated would foster an environment of non-stereotyping and encourage learning . 	0

WD	32765	It is clear to me that the issue of single-sex education juggles an academic as well as a psychological / social side . 	0
WD	32766	A article published by ABC News focuses on the negative effects of single-sex education when it comes to the social aspect . 	0
WD	32767	"But does that single-sex environment only further the intelligence of the "" elite "" students in private education ? "	0

WD	32769	Another factor in this issue is that most single-sex schools are private , and require an entrance test . 	0
WD	32770	Therefore , one can argue that the students in single-sex schools are already at an advantage . 	0
WD	32771	Studies show that women suffer from a stereotype threat in math and science , meaning that in the fields of math and science women are more apprehensive to perform due to their perceived inferiority to men . 	0
WD	32772	Perhaps that is why girls at my high school were so confident in their work , there were no boys to do better and perhaps this is why women are always found to do better in single-sex school environments . 	0

WD	32784	Many schools are choosing to spend those limited resources on single-sex programs despite the fact that ‚Äú there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students ‚Äô academic performance , but there is evidence that sex segregation increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism . ‚Äù 	0
WD	32785	The Socialist agenda of world domination makes no place for solemn ‚Äú swearing ‚Äù between individuals . 	0

WD	32795	Homeschool has morphed into a uniquely American creation . 	0
WD	32796	We should all be proud of what it has become no matter where we stand on the homeschool versus public school debate . 	0
WD	32797	Then there is the mix of private school and homeschool , where the student is taught in a classroom three days a week and the parent downloads assignments from the same teacher the other two days a week . 	0

WD	32801	I ' m a regular education teacher . 	0
WD	32802	I have students mainstreamed into my class every year . 	0
WD	32803	My opinion is that it needs to be done far more judiciously than it is done now- if six exceptional children are put in my class , that is the equivalent of putting an entire special ed classroom into my regular class . 	0
WD	32804	I personally feel like these kids are shortchanged- some of them are good kids who need an adult close by and able to give more focused attention . 	0
WD	32805	In a class of 30+ , this isn ' t going to happen consistently . 	0
WD	32806	And some of the ones who come to me have legally imposed modifications , some of which have little or no bearing on what I teach , so I am not allowed to handle my class in a way I think it should be done . 	0
WD	32807	That impairs my efficiency as an educator . 	0
WD	32808	Also , some have so many modifications that for all intents and purposes they are merely taking a special ed class whose physical location just happens to be in a regular classroom . 	0
WD	32809	From my point of view , mainstreaming is not a terrible idea , but it is lamentable in its execution , and because of that , damaging in its results . 	1
WD	32810	Dr . Densmore encourages parents to keep themselves on an even keel and project a steady , positive attitude . 	0
WD	32811	Lib mentality on crack ! 	0
WD	32812	Extreme behavioral trouble , kids that just aren ' t able to keep up with what they ' re learning in average classes , etc . But on the whole , I like mainstreaming . 	1
WD	32813	Besides forbidding perjury , ( calling God to witness a lie ) and false swearing , this passage also forbids all rash and unnecessary swearing , and especially warns against promissory oaths ‚Äì that require a performance . 	0
WD	32814	Public schools receive money from federal and state governments and are obligated to do whatever the state and national governments say . 	0
WD	32815	I have 2 kids born 3 years 2 days apart . 	0
WD	32816	It is a juggling act for teachers in inclusive classrooms to handle the needs of so many different students but it is well worth the reward . 	1
WD	32817	"He also notes in the article the classroom ' s reaction to Jonas ' demeanor ( slow to articulate his words , delay in making his meaning understanding ) and how there is a clearly defined moment where the classroom establishes that Jonas is "" different "" . "	0
WD	32818	The professor realizes in that instance that this is a moment for himself and the classroom to accept and engage Jonas and somehow help him navigate his way throughout the course and the classroom . 	0
WD	32819	Forced prayer isn ‚Äô t prayer anyway . 	0
WD	32820	When prayer was removed from the schools I think that it worked to the Christians advantage , not against them . 	0
WD	32821	I have a feeling that all we Christians are asking for when they want prayer back into the schools is for some sort of superior respect above all other religions in allowing us to have our sacred prayers brought into the schools . 	0
WD	32822	How many of us would stand for that kind of equality ? 	0
WD	32823	Jesus said to expect persecution , suffering , being servants of all and to be in the face of regular culture standards . 	0
WD	32824	Why would Christians demand or even expect that their way of doing things should be allowed and even made a routine ? 	0
WD	32825	It makes no sense to expect a public school to act in a Christian manner . 	0
WD	32826	He did not say to get upset when the government goes the opposite way of what is comfortable to us and try to make our systems fit our religious needs the best . 	0
WD	32827	If prayer being in the schools or not seriously affects the outcome of our students , or affects anything at all in the Christian world negatively than I think we have a lot more serious problems to think about than whether or not the kids are allowed to pray or not in school . 	0
WD	32828	It makes no sense to expect a public school to bring prayer back , if that ‚Äô s what we want , we should send our kids to a Christian school . 	0
WD	32829	We not only have a strong parental relationship but the siblings do as well . 	0
WD	32830	This alone is a wonderful opportunity for building social skills . 	0
WD	32831	The usual argument for private schools is that they have the freedom to offer any curriculum that they choose , and the freedom to hire or fire teachers who can teach effectively . 	0
WD	32832	He notes that student bodies are increasingly riddled with drugs , violence , promiscuity , emotional disorders , crime , illiteracy , peer dependency and contempt for authority . 	0
WD	32833	It is disturbing to read the 101 reasons to homeschool . 	0
WD	32834	How is that for socialization ? 	0
WD	32835	One reason we choose to homeschool is because our family wanted to maintain family relationships in a way that cannot be done if our children are in school six-plus hours a day . 	0
WD	32836	Life is short and we want to spend the majority of our time together . 	0
WD	32837	Children grow up quickly and before you know it , they are heading off on their own . 	0
WD	32838	Of course this is not the only reason to homeschool but since we are interacting with each other all day long , it forces us to deal with relationship issues when they come up . 	0
WD	32839	We enjoy being around our children and they enjoy being around us . 	0
WD	32840	There is no longer an absolute and just legal basis for judging ‚Äú between a man and his brother , ‚Äù much less a man and his neighbor ( Deuteronomy 1 : 16 , 17 ) . 	0

WD	32843	Leonard Sax , a psychologist and physician , argues not only that gender segregated schools can be equal , but that they can be better than coeducational schooling . 	1
WD	32844	The Supreme Court ruled that separate but equal in regard to race is not actually equal at all . 	0
WD	32845	Should we expect gendered segregation of schooling to be any different ? 	0
WD	32846	According to the ACLU , not only are sex-segregated educational programs ineffective , they are illegal . 	1
WD	32847	Title IX , which states that ‚Äú No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù , is where the ACLU and other opponents of sex-segregated schools point to bolster their claim of illegality . 	0
WD	32848	He argues that the language of ‚Äú separate but equal ‚Äù in relation to the single-sex education debate is out of place because while racial segregation of schooling was about limiting students ‚Äô access , single-sex education is about broadening students ‚Äô access and opportunities . 	0
WD	32849	The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) disagrees . 	0
WD	32850	The ACLU has struggled against sex-segregated schooling for a very long time , but earlier this year they officially launched their ‚Äú Teach Kids , Not Stereotypes ‚Äù campaign . 	0
WD	32851	As a part of the campaign , they gathered data on single-sex education programs in 15 states and found that the majority of them were out of compliance with Title IX requirements . 	0

WD	32861	I would argue that integration is an aspiration and not a prerequisite for ensuring the best education for disabled children . 	0
WD	32862	This has the effect of treating all students the same and teaching them the same things , despite the fact that every student is unique , and not all students fit into the same categories . 	0
WD	32863	Just look at the students of the Kings School you see traveling to school I went to the Lorien novalis school fete at dural on Saturday amazed at the Muslim mothers there but then I thought this school gives them the chance to partipate in their children ' s education far more than the local state school so as a community private education is far better around than state education can be 	1

WD	32874	If a private school is not teaching its students well enough , its graduation rate , or its college acceptance rate , will sink , and parents will be able to quickly remove their child and put him or her into a better school . 	0

WD	32903	Give me a break ! 	0
WD	32904	It would require that they make certain that their children are given opportunities to interact with and form lasting relationships with other children in their age group , and this is can achieved by exposing them to extracurricular activities . 	0
WD	32905	I sent my kid to private school so that she could get a better education . 	0

WD	32914	Kids are taught to pass standardized exams rather than learn the material effectively . 	0
WD	32915	My kids attend public school now and I detest it . 	0
WD	32916	In fact I had one teacher tell me she didn ' t assign homework because the kids didn ' t do it anyway . . . WHAT ? 	0
WD	32917	They can ' t bring home their books , so they rarely have homework to reinforce what they ' ve learned in school . 	0
WD	32918	I also don ' t agree for constant reward parties for doing everyday things . 	0
WD	32919	So reward the bad behavior ? ? 	0
WD	32920	If understood , our word uttered in integrity should of itself be a sufficient and proper bond . 	0
WD	32921	It is , and always has been pure ignorance , stop slating something you have no experience or knowledge about . 	0
WD	32922	If it is a public school it should be a place where all cultures and all religions and all people should be able to come and feel comfortable in order to do what they are there to do which I ‚Äô m sorry is not to learn about religion . 	0
WD	32923	If you want prayer forced send your child to a religious specific school . 	0
WD	32924	Yet you walk down the street or listen to the 18-24ish yr olds today and they are complaining about having to work more than 6 hours at a decently paying job . 	0
WD	32925	I remember my Grandfather telling stories of the horrible things that he was forced to do in WWII things that no one should ever have to go through , NO ONE ( at 19 mind you ) . 	0
WD	32926	In conclusion , I personally believe that forcing prayer upon our children in the class room is wrong . 	1
WD	32927	Ok if anyone has actually read this entire thing I thank you for your time and I apologize if I have jumped around a lot . 	0
WD	32928	I know that more than half of you remember when you were young if you didn ‚Äô t do what your father told you , you were going to get the belt , and you know what you sure never made that mistake again . 	0
WD	32929	In today ‚Äô s society it has become acceptable to avoid all sense of responsibility . 	0
WD	32930	People today are basically in my mind , for a lack of a better word soft . 	0
WD	32931	Now , you even show your child a belt with the intention of hitting him / her and your own child can sue you . 	0
WD	32932	This was different . 	0
WD	32933	This was saying we believe in coeducation , because we live in a coed world , but in this one particular area we ‚Äô re giving up . 	0
WD	32934	Those schools weren ‚Äô t founded on the premise that men and women have incompatible intellects , but in recognition of what were often limited educational opportunities for women . 	0
WD	32935	Their origin stories belonged to the past , and their traditions continued , Hogwarts-like , under their own steam . 	0
WD	32936	Everything I could think of saying sounded offensive or deflating or dumb : math is hard for girls ; they‚Äîthat is , you‚Äîneed special treatment ; boys ‚Äô and girls ‚Äô brains are different ; pre-algebra with boys in the room is just too exciting‚Äîyou won ‚Äô t know what hit you ! 	0
WD	32937	If we ‚Äô d chosen an all-girls ‚Äô school , that would be one thing . 	0
WD	32938	I ‚Äô d never found the arguments especially persuasive . 	0
WD	32939	But what really brought me up short was imagining how I would explain the policy to my daughter , whose best friends were boys . 	0
WD	32940	A few years ago , when I was looking at middle schools for my daughter , I heard about a school that sounded lovely except for one thing : it had a policy of separating math classes by gender . 	0
WD	32941	Having reported on a vogue for single-sex classrooms in the nineties , I knew the rationale : girls and boys distract one another ; girls need extra ego boosts and a gentle approach when it comes to studying math and science . 	0
WD	32942	The public schools are not going to get better . 	1
WD	32943	no . teachers keep asking for more with no difference in teaching just more money and if they dont get it what happens they strike . well thats real nice on kids education is it not boo hoo you TAKE YOUR KIDS PRIVATE IF YOU CARE AS I DID 	1
WD	32944	BIG E . what about all the money we do send to our schools . does it help our child . 	0
WD	32945	Now , we are talking about a school-sponsored prayer . 	0
WD	32946	No student-sponsored prayer is , or needs to be , prohibited . 	0
WD	32947	But in the Cold War , America was distinguishing itself from a Communist enemy that was known to be atheistic . 	0
WD	32948	So , the school district in New York decided to develop a prayer which they thought anyone who believed in God could pray . 	0
WD	32949	But you have to look at the background on this . 	0
WD	32950	Our country was initially populated by people escaping religious persecution who were looking for a safe have to practice their own religion . 	0
WD	32951	When we came together as a country , we had a religiously diverse population , so when we wrote the constitution , we had to say that the government would not support any religion at the expense of others , nor would it prohibit the free exercise of religion . 	0
WD	32952	Prayer in public schools was a complicated issue where there was a religious diversity amongst students and teachers , because , how could , say , Catholics and Protestants agree on a prayer to say . 	0
WD	32953	( Those of you who pray , do you ever pray generic prayers ? ) 	0
WD	32954	I am sorry but we are forced through our property taxes to support a system that we do not believe works and shows no sign of improving . 	1
WD	32955	We also incur the additional cost associate with sending our child to a school we feel confident will give her what she need to be successful in life . 	0
WD	32956	So I say Allison Benedikt , treat the cause not the system . 	0
WD	32957	The major thing was that I always felt like the presence of boys would have made the girls far less bitchy ( as they did in my co-ed school experiences ) . 	0
WD	32958	My wife and I live in a very expensive suburb . 	0
WD	32959	We pay very high taxes , most of which are allocated to an adequate school system that is monetarily driven by a broken system designed to teach children the answers to the questions not how they derive at them . 	0
WD	32960	As such there is pressure on the schools to meet the GPA standards that there states put on the schools that they have forgotten why the children are there in the first place . 	0
WD	32961	Every other week we hear stories about another child that has died from an overdose of heroin and how it has become an epidemic in the school systems . 	0
WD	32962	The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) of 1990 requires all schools to provide services for children who need special education in the ‚Äú least restrictive environment conducive to learning . ‚Äù 	0
WD	32963	And in that aspect , he ' s correct : According to Virginia law , parents who have a religious objection can opt to not only home-school their children but to do so without any government oversight , meaning there is no mandatory curriculum and no checks placed on the family to ensure the children are learning at an appropriate level . 	0
WD	32964	It was previously mentioned in this project that coeducational schools need to adopt a non-stereotyping language and equal opportunity environment to foster equity and success between boys and girls . 	0
WD	32965	There is about 5 cases a year for the whole province of Quebec , mostly very immature children . 	0

WD	32969	Everybody in my family ( my siblings , husband ‚Äô s sibling ) skipped a year in school i . e . moved forward faster . 	0
WD	32970	Three of my girls were born in August , but there is no question of holding them back . 	1
WD	32971	I am a product and proponent of the public school system , and do my best to support to support local public schools ( especially when it comes to music and arts programs ) whenever possible . 	0
WD	32972	I also send my son to a local private elementary school . 	0
WD	32973	More to the point , US public schools are the best in the world . 	1
WD	32974	So , no special education , no behavior problems , and no unbalanced portion of low socio-economic students coming from families with suspect value of education . 	0
WD	32975	If students fail the high-stakes test in America , schools are forced to pass them on to the next grade , again , because public schools are rarely allowed to enforce retention policies to prevent students from being placed in classes beyond their demonstrable ability . 	0
WD	32976	"They are required to teach EVERYONE regardless of ability , income , behavior , etc . . . Other countries have education systems built upon the tract theory where if a student fails a test at a certain grade level , that student moves into an alternative education tract that will prepare them for "" career "" training at their "" ability level . "" "	0
WD	32977	The ugly truth about private schools is that these institutions can select who attends through entrance exams and other admissions criteria . 	0
WD	32978	It is absolutely correct . 	0
WD	32979	Public schools have neither option . 	0
WD	32980	They can also enforce consequences for attendance and discipline policies . 	0
WD	32981	We were taught tolerance and acceptance . 	0
WD	32982	Clearly we ‚Äô re off to a great start . 	0
WD	32983	With private schools stealing students away from public schools , the problem is exacerbated further . 	0
WD	32984	This ultimately results in other countries getting to the point where only best are tested and compared internationally , whereas American public schools test EVERY student at EVERY level . 	0
WD	32985	Pulled him out again and put him in a selective school and he ' s loving it . 	0
WD	32986	This could lead to costly court battles , or more children entering into inadequate homeschooling programs . 	0
WD	32987	What if the child ' s parents dissent ? 	0
WD	32988	Although I accept that initial intentions can be noble , sometimes , the language of liberation can carry an unintended payload . 	0
WD	32989	If you don ' t do well , it isn ' t necessarily the school ' s fault . 	0
WD	32990	Public school is what you and your parents make of it . 	1
WD	32991	Everyone I know went to public school and on to college . 	0
WD	32992	It really is up to the student to do the work . 	0
WD	32993	Maybe schools were better then . 	0
WD	32994	We didn ' t feel unprepared . 	0
WD	32995	I hope these kids get a chance in life their parents are denying them . 	0
WD	32996	And people who are fortunate enough to send their children to a private school or to , even better , homeschool , are not going to make a difference . 	0
WD	32997	Social advancement ? 	0
WD	32998	Human nature makes the final result , of anything having a lack of competition and guaranteed employment , stagnation for the simple lack of incentive . 	0
WD	32999	Unions and their inherent lack of competition is what is wrong with our schools , government and anything else unions monopolize . 	0
WD	33000	It ' s human nature . 	0
WD	33001	The problem is without competition , the product becomes stale and innovation disappears . 	0
WD	33002	Unions DO NOT like competition ( try walking across a strike line , you SCAB ) . 	0
WD	33003	For years they nearly had one , the result , the sad shape of our public school system . 	0
WD	33004	Public schools want a monopoly . 	0
WD	33005	Those enrolled in private schools still support public schools thru RET ' s like every other property owner . 	0
WD	33006	Whether the result is choosing a state school , independent school or home education will depend on our children , our selves and our family situations . 	0
WD	33007	If we don ' t make decisions based on our ideas and beliefs , our moral values and our understanding of the world - then surely we are failing to do our best for our children . 	0
WD	33008	To say school is best is every bit as ideological as any argument for home education . 	0
WD	33009	But then everyone is . 	0
WD	33010	But they are guided by their own values , beliefs and yes - ideology . 	0
WD	33011	Others come to it later because school has not worked for their child . 	0
WD	33012	Some choose it at the start because their child appears to be unsuited to early formal education , or because they favour education methods not available in state schools . 	0
WD	33013	Home educators come from many backgrounds , with many different beliefs and use many different educational methods - from the very structured , adult-led to the informal , child-led . 	0

WD	33165	I think the individual schools themselves and and the individual needs of your daughters are more important than generalisations about education and single-sex or co-ed schools . 	0
WD	33166	However , if you want an opinon from a general education pespective , and you can read up on this , the general rule is that single sex schools are better for the academic performance of your daughters . 	1

WD	33190	You are still allowed to pray in school as long as it doesn ‚Äô t affect the education that the school system is trying to give our children . 	0
WD	33191	All the enrichment camps and afterschool activities will not make up for the fact that your kid is bored for 6-8 hours per day in school and whips through their homework in a flash , or takes all night because they are so bored they can ' t stand it . 	0
WD	33192	I believe that parents should send their kids to the school the best fits the needs of the child at the time . 	0
WD	33193	Yes , parents can provide support and should , but when your child is bored at school , there is only so much you can do to help with that . 	0
WD	33194	Occasionally , you will get lucky and have a teacher that will challenge your kid in class , but if not , then what ? 	0
WD	33195	And it is the cornerstone of a child ‚Äô s well-being , ‚Äù Densmore told me . 	0
WD	33196	The National Association for the Education of Young Children offers lots of information about the benefits of play and how parents and teachers can help facilitate it . 	0
WD	33197	Prayer should be back in school to give these kids that are going up a sense of belief , trust and fear of God , because kids these days think they could do anything they want to and get away with it . 	1

WD	33219	Even the language of the serious case review demonstrates this failure of understanding . 	0
WD	33220	Small wonder that home-educating parents are afraid of conferring power on people who do not know what it is that they are judging . 	0
WD	33221	This is particularly so for families who have taken children out of school ; they would be in the insidious position of being answerable to a system that they believe has already failed them . 	0

Muslims go to Muslim schools , Christians to Christian schools , Jewish to Jewish schools etc . ) , and for all other students , no religious doctrine in the schools , period . 	1
WD	33235	Here ' s a suggestion : why don ' t we all stop pretending that Canada is this utopian place where everyone holds hands and sings about buying the world a coke in their own language . 	0
WD	33236	I find it simply offensive that Christianity is seen as some sort of imperialistic oppressive practice even when the majority of the students in the class are Christian , because it makes students of other faiths ' uncomfortable , yet any other religion cries racism when the situation is reversed . 	0
WD	33237	If my memory serves me correctly , there has been plenty of controversy over reciting the Lord ' s Prayer in schools , yet this special status has been given to Muslim students , in this case . 	0
WD	33238	If so then people better start brushing up on their knowledge of less widely practiced religions , such as Wicca , Shinto , Satanism , Kabbalah , Bahai ' i , etc . And what happens when one practice interferes with another practice ' s beliefs . 	0

WD	33244	My Son has complex needs and starts mainstream in September and it makes me angry when I hear Parents like Joanne having such a struggle to find a place for their Child I agree too , that although labels are scary for Parents , with them , the Children do get more benefits and support , so can be a positive thing Fran 	0
WD	33245	These beliefs on the effects of homeschooling on socialization have led to numerous studies on homeschooled kids . 	0
WD	33246	Rather than prove these beliefs to be correct , they show a very clear picture that homeschooled children and teens present a distinct advantage over their peers in public school . 	0
WD	33247	Because of the growing incidences of peer pressure and bullying , violence , drugs , promiscuity and moral relativism , the greater is the belief of parents that they need to take their kids out of public school before these influences have a detrimental effect on both their lives and their future . 	0
WD	33248	It is ironic to say the least that in Dr . Brian Ray ‚Äô s California study , around 92 percent of public school superintendents harbors the erroneous notions that homeschooled kids are socially impaired , emotionally unstable , and ‚Äú too judgmental ‚Äù of their community and the world in general . 	0
WD	33249	President Theodore Roosevelt once said , ‚Äú To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society . ‚Äù 	0
WD	33250	This is an ideal that is being espoused by homeschooling parents who no longer wish to expose their children to the questionable teachings and people that are a part of the public school system . 	0
WD	33251	Teachers , on the other hand , are afraid that they will lose their jobs to more effective parents who are not even certified educators . 	0
WD	33252	It is not surprising , therefore , that they would constantly put down homeschooling as not an effective form of education , specifically targeting the ‚Äú lack of social skills ‚Äù as a main point against homeschoolers . 	0
WD	33253	What she will get is brainwashed to be a liberal zombie and grow up to write and believe stupid articles like this one . 	0
WD	33254	What a load of BS . 	0
WD	33255	All I can say is WOW ! ! ! 	0
WD	33256	That ' s right , I do not give a s**t about the public schools system , I care about giving my child the best education and best opportunities possible and she will NOT get that at a public school . 	0
WD	33257	I never post on these things but today I had to . 	0
WD	33258	However it may take a little while to really settle down to an ‚Äú absence of a rigid routine ‚Äù before you can enjoy this freedom from timetables and rules of an educational institution . 	0

WD	33260	I don ‚Äô t know if any school can nourish her love for science as much as my husband and I do . ‚Äù 	0
WD	33261	She is my one and only and I want to go all out to nurture her interest . 	0
WD	33262	She simply loves doing what we do . 	0
WD	33263	We do science experiments , go on nature walks , explore the environment around us and create our own worksheets . 	0

WD	33267	I ‚Äô m thinking / planning on submitting this to the local Sarnia newspaper in repsonse to all the poorly written letters lobbying for prayer to be brought back into the schools . 	0
WD	33268	Additionally , it is said that homeschooled children do well on standardised tests , and as adults , are known to be self-directed learners and reliable employees . 	0
WD	33269	On the other hand , as a family member recently pointed out to me , by homeschooling children we could be stunting the development of their socialisation skills . 	0
WD	33270	I make that point because teachers specialise in specific subject areas and if parents choose to homeschool their children , it is expected that they would have vast knowledge of each subject area which they choose to teach their children . 	0
WD	33271	Research in the United States has shown that homeschooling is growing at a rate of seven to 15 per cent per year , with millions of children currently learning at home . 	0
WD	33272	Indeed , that is a distinct possibility and the onus would have to be on the parents to ensure that does not happen . 	0
WD	33273	And , some studies indicate that children who are redshirted also have higher use of special education services in elementary school and higher rates of behavioral problems in adolescence . 	0
WD	33274	I ' m always fasinated by the ideology argument . 	0
WD	33275	But to just bring in services for one group flies in the face of equality . 	0
WD	33276	I think that religion should be either implemented for ALL religions ; or otherwise , for none . 	1
WD	33277	Doesn ‚Äô t it make sense that they would therefore do a better job and that public schools would therefore do better in quantitative comparisons ? 	0
WD	33278	The public school system lets them deal with real life too , unfortunate that it may be but that is what ' s out there in college and the work force too . 	0

WD	33286	Adolescence is hard enough without having to try learning in an environment of hormone-laced competition and distraction . 	0
WD	33287	If I had teen-aged children today I would seek out single-sex education for them without hesitation . 	1
WD	33288	Then those who ran public education decreed that every child should have a college-prep curriculum . 	0
WD	33289	When I left that school , seniors were lucky to have two hours of shop ; the rest of the time they spent taking courses for which they had no need , desire or use . 	0
WD	33290	The Supreme Court said that it violated the establishment clause of the Constitution to have this prayer , even though the prayer was a generic prayer . 	0
WD	33291	I went to public schools , I thrived in public schools - my mom MADE me go to public schools . 	0
WD	33292	Co-ed schools don ' t cultivate the cooperation or better understanding between the opposite sexes , That ' s a myth . . . otherwise why would you have high rates of divorce and acrimony just a few years after they graduate out of co-ed schools and colleges ? 	0
WD	33293	Schooling is not a time for all such acts and learning falls by the wayside . 	0
WD	33294	No wonder why our educational standards are sliding . . 	0
WD	33295	Co-ed schools these days are becoming morally corrupt . 	0
WD	33296	Most Kids are distracted , do a lot of sexting , indulge / experiment in sexual acts , go on emotional outbursts ( act like adults ! ) and so on . . . 	0
WD	33297	You are a bad person if you don ' t do whatever it takes to get YOUR child the best education and start in life possible , and if that means sending your child to private school , that ' s what you do . 	1
WD	33298	So , does delaying kindergarten give kids a head start ? 	0
WD	33299	Private and parochial schools are more likely to adhere to the same value system as the families whose kids attend them , while public schools tend to reflect the values of whatever politician is in charge of them at the moment . 	0
WD	33300	I found the attitude and behaviour of students in the co ed school to be better , and i attribute that to the influence of the opposite sex . 	0
WD	33301	IMO the only ' bad person ' here is the person writing the article . 	0
WD	33302	The writer is free to send her kids wherever she wants and so is everyone else . 	0
WD	33303	Even despite this range , the overall frequency is much lower than previously thought . 	0
WD	33304	However , evidence also indicates that age at school entry is a poor predictor of school success , with younger children performing just as well or better than their older peers . 	0
WD	33305	It appears that it can , at least for the first few years of elementary school , and this is especially true for kids who are already at risk for school difficulties due to socio-economic factors ( unfortunately those are also the kids who are least likely to start later ) . 	0
WD	33306	I have five Daughters and they all went to private schools and everyone of them have a degree and now have good paying jobs . 	0

WD	31276	Tried for three years to keep my children at the local public school . 	0
WD	31277	On the school board etc . If they want the middle class to leave their kids at public school they need to put effort in to meet their educational needs of the children and give us a reason to stay not just fob us off with your children will be all right because of their demographic background . 	0
WD	31278	The standard was set at the lowest common denominator with no effort put into challenge children who were bored . 	0
WD	31279	They need to bring back classes where all children ' s needs are met not just the worst behaved , why should the whole class be punished because one child ' s behaviour . 	0
WD	31280	Composite classes should be discouraged as teachers are unable to meet all the levels needed and are more likely to ignore those who can do the work at the higher grade . 	0
WD	31281	They do not have time to offer more complex work or seem reluctant to celebrate intelligence , attention to detail and completing work that comes from the higher achieving students . 	0
WD	31282	In all of the three years before baled from public school despite talks and promises that things would improve nothing changed . 	0
WD	31283	We left and went from bored , hating school children to excited about learning , keen to get to school , enthused again . 	0
WD	31284	Not exactly over night but certainly by the end of the 2nd term at the new school . 	0
WD	31285	Public schools need to do more to keep those of us who care about education attending their schools . 	0
WD	31286	You want creativity , not teaching to the test . 	0
WD	31287	But there is in practice very limited access to these - it costs money , and these schools are few and far between . 	0
WD	31288	When Ed Balls thinks about all those children growing up uncontaminated by all this his head must nearly explode . 	0
WD	31289	One single ideology ! 	0
WD	31290	You want great outdoor space and small classrooms and personal attention . 	0
WD	31291	If you look at education philosophy and ideas it becomes clear that our current state school system is very much based on a narrow set of ideas . 	0
WD	31292	To not have an ideology - does this mean that you don ' t think that any other world view is acceptable , or that you simple don ' t think ? 	0
WD	31293	That it is wrong to do something because you belief it is right and have thought about the ideas behind it ! 	0
WD	31294	If they survive all this lot they can be brainwashed into embracing multiculturalism , diversity , man-made climate change and sex education , even when their parents don ' t want it for them . 	0

WD	31300	Upon leaving my all girls school , I learned that someone there had told people I left due to a heroin addiction . 	0
WD	31301	I mean , WHAT IN THE WORLD ? ! 	0
WD	31302	I asked them to tell me why . 	0
WD	31303	I later learned that I came off as a combination of snobby , shy and rude ‚Äì simply because I hadn ‚Äô t spent enough time in social situations or just being around the opposite sex , and I had no idea how to talk to them ! 	0
WD	31304	Switching schools changed that all for the better . 	0
WD	31305	Having spent middle school ‚Äì those really developmental years , around very few boys ‚Äì talking to them became a major cause of stress . 	0

WD	31318	I wanted my children to grow up with their faith being a part of their every day lives . 	0
WD	31319	Also , if your children attended this school , parent involvement was an expectation . 	0
WD	31320	As a result , every Home / School association meeting was packed . 	0
WD	31321	Everyone went to orientation . 	0
WD	31322	I knew the parents of every child my kids went to school with . 	0

WD	33322	It ' s 12 : 40 . . . 	0
WD	33323	That the Commonwealth of Virginia has such a rich tradition of the education of young people and allows this travesty is shameful . 	0
WD	33324	The point is not to fling those stereotypes back and forth , but to have a respectful discussion about the ideas of a home education versus a public standardized environment . 	0
WD	33325	And if any part of that made no sense , just point it out . 	0
WD	33326	I think putting a 4 year old on kindergarten is more about the parents need to prove how superior their child is than it is about what is best for the child Or , more likely , it ' s a low to middle income parent , and they ' d rather send the child to school than pay for another year of daycare while they work . 	0
WD	33327	Neither of these scenarios were true for me . 	0

WD	33331	The evidence wasn ‚Äô t very good then for a gap between the genders ‚Äô learning styles so significant that it would mandate separate instruction , and it hasn ‚Äô t gotten any better . 	0
WD	33332	Of course there are psychological and intellectual differences between men and women , but meta-analyses of the best studies show that those differences are relatively small , that there is a great deal of variability among individuals , and that , as the neuroscientist Lise Eliot writes , ‚Äú fundamentally , men and women are more similar than different . ‚Äù 	0

WD	33334	Men were hardwired for sleeping around and math , women for monogamy and English . 	0
WD	33335	Most people didn ‚Äô t know much about brain science , but that didn ‚Äô t stop them from trotting out vaguely recalled findings based on a handful of M . R . I . s showing that men and women thought differently . 	0

WD	33338	I remembered all this last week when I read about a new trend toward single-sex classrooms . 	0
WD	33339	Only about a dozen public schools were trying them in 2002 , but since the Department of Education relaxed its rules on gender-segregated classrooms , in 2006 , about five hundred public schools across the country have adopted them , according to an A . P . story . 	0
WD	33340	In May , the A . C . L . U . sent cease-and-desist letters to school districts in Alabama , Maine , Mississippi , West Virginia , and Virginia that have been separating boys and girls for academic instruction . 	0
WD	33341	Any personal experiences to share ? 	0
WD	33342	What do you think about kindergarten redshirting ? 	0
WD	33343	A lot of the academic stuff evens itself out by 3rd grade . 	0
WD	33344	Some kids take longer to learn subjects and it doesn ‚Äô t necessarily mean they ‚Äô re less smart than , say , kids who learned to read a year earlier . 	0
WD	33345	My child goes to public school , and if the school starts to suck then guess what I ' ll send her to private school to get a better education Because sometimes you just can ' t fix stupid ! 	1
WD	33346	If my daughters can be in an environment that celebrates girls as intelligent , creative individuals , without the boy craziness ( and reducing of one ' s self to something befitting a boy ' s attention ) , than I will take it . 	0
WD	33347	"No , you are not a "" bad "" person if you send your kids to private school . "	0
WD	33348	"Most public schools cannot handle really "" bright "" kids . "	0
WD	33349	This is especially true at the elementary school level where they have to teach to the middle at best and the lower achieving kids most of the time . 	0
WD	33350	Why ? 	0
WD	33351	They have to teach to the test , so their focus is making sure their kids will pass the standardized tests that are given . 	0
WD	33352	Kids that are really bright , quick learners , etc . get bored and in a lot of cases start acting up . 	0

WD	33355	Homeschooling is one of the ways we can fight back . 	0
WD	33356	He would have been bored going over the same things and not getting challenged . 	0
WD	33357	We live in a day of under-protective parenting . 	0
WD	33358	It ‚Äô s what lets you pick their friends and control the nature , speed and context of their broader socialization . 	0
WD	33359	It ‚Äô s what lets you insulate them from the world before their maturity is ready to engage it on their own . 	0
WD	33360	It ‚Äô s what allows you to optimally shape their spiritual life , and pour into it without contest during those years when there should be no contest . 	0
WD	33361	I hope and pray and that every parent will consider homeschooling their child at least through the most pivotal years , which to my thinking , is late elementary and middle school years . 	0
WD	33362	I cannot say this strongly enough . 	0
WD	33363	We had to have a GED or a degree from a correspondence school . 	0
WD	33364	Having multiple inclusion kids in a classroom can slow a class down . 	0
WD	33365	A little flexibility like that is fine but I think it would be easy to go over board . 	0
WD	33366	I have sent my son to private schools so that he could avoid the negative elements of society . 	0
WD	33367	Homeschool was very different when I was in school . 	0
WD	33368	What a waste of time and money and takes a very short view of life long goals of independence . . 	0
WD	33369	I ' m dumbfounded these parents would deny their children an education - or one that is so insufficient they require three years of remedial-college to simply be able to attend another 4 year university . 	0
WD	33370	It wouldn ' t work anyhow . 	0
WD	33371	We ‚Äô re working on such things and , in recent weeks , I ‚Äô ve noticed a ton of positive changes in Ryan . 	0
WD	33372	A recent survey in Ghana found that of 450 children enrolled in low-cost , private schools , 449 were previously enrolled in government-subsidised schools ‚Äì those schools that will now suffer as a result of poor investment . 	0
WD	33373	Yet there is a consistent failure on the part of local authorities and government reviews to grasp even the basis of the ideas that can underlie a different kind of education . 	0
WD	33374	Evidence including our own suggests strongly that this kind of education prepares children to enter further and higher education , or the workforce ‚Äì and offers them the freedom to learn in the ways that suit them best . 	0
WD	33375	We have half-a-year which means A LOT can change before kindergarten ( besides , since when did kids have to be perfect for kindergarten ? ) . 	0
WD	33376	It is here that home educators have their strongest reservations . 	0
WD	33377	And , most insidious of all , if the law were changed , social workers and education professionals would presumably be expected to monitor the quality of education provided . 	0
WD	33378	Research by ourselves at the University of London ' s Institute of Education has shown how diverse individual learners are , and therefore the diversity of ways in which their needs can best be met . 	0
WD	33379	Education at home is nothing like education at school . 	1
WD	33380	Styles of education can change between children and over time , bringing a flexibility and dynamism that would be impossible in a formal setting . 	0
WD	33381	Home education can range from the highly structured , based on set curriculums and lessons , to the completely informal . 	0
WD	33382	That school should be the benchmark against which all education is measured is resented by many home educators . 	0
WD	33383	While officials talk the language of individualism and chances for everybody , home educators are in a position to deliver precisely that kind of tailor-made education . 	0
WD	33384	After more than 25 years of severe moral decline is it not time to repent , reverence the name of the Lord , reinstitute and keep the third commandment ? 	0
WD	33385	I believe everyone deserves an education , and much more than the 12 years we get , but I also believe I have a choice to do what I feel is best for my children ! 	0
WD	33386	As a matter of fact , as a homeowner , I am supporting both systems , much more than those less fortunate can . 	0
WD	33387	You actively , with forethought , work to deny your child an education ? 	0
WD	33388	Just a thought - the way it works in my community is REAL ESTATE TAXES fund our public schools . 	0
WD	33389	Therefore I am not taking ANYTHING away from the public school system by sending my sons to private school . 	0
WD	33390	It would be silly to sacrifice him to public schools to make them better . 	0
WD	33391	In recent years , the biggest gains in education occurred when governments eliminated user fees to deliver on the right to education , leading to tens of millions of children enrolling in school for the first time , and supporting low-cost private schools mocks the importance of that evidence . 	0
WD	33392	It comes from 2 Chronicles 7 : 14 which is summarized as ‚Äú If we pray , seek , turn ; then God hears , forgives , heals . ‚Äù 	0
WD	33393	As I moved from middle school into high school , my friends moved from homeschool to public school . 	0

WD	33395	The article is written from the professor ' s perspective and he writes about his experience in teaching Jonas and some of the issues that he felt Jonas dealt with in the class . 	0
WD	33396	In the article , the professor describes the first day of class and how Jonas asked him if there would be a paper required for the course in which the professor responded that was how the previous course was taught and that he would solicit the thoughts of the class and he noticed how Jonas ' demeanor changed with his answer . 	0
WD	33397	Granted , public education , like most other government programs , is corrupt at it ' s core and an administrative nightmare , it needs to be completely overhauled , but the fact remains that the populace needs to be educated and if not forced by law , a lot of parents simply wouldn ' t bother , paying for their kid ' s education gets in the way of the new car and the designer jeans . 	1
WD	33398	If you come out on the other side deficient , it ‚Äô s hard to make up for that . 	0
WD	33399	There are many elements that come into play when mainstreaming special education students into regular education settings . 	0
WD	33400	"Teachers will need to educate themselves so they can learn different strategies to teach two diverse groups , exceptional students and "" regular "" students , in the same classroom . "	0
WD	33401	The inclusive classroom is different in that the individualized styles of learning and needs of the students fall outside the normal parameter . 	0
WD	33402	Sometimes it is not only the teacher that is resistant but the exceptional students as well are resistant to the change in educational setting because they are used to being separated from the mainstream of school life . 	0
WD	33403	This is where teamwork will become important between the school , the students , and the teachers . 	0
WD	33404	The inclusive classroom is a different dynamic so everyone will have to adjust but the transition will be easier with cooperation from everyone . 	0
WD	33405	I read an article on a particular student named Jonas , a previous special education high school student , and his experience in a college setting . 	0
WD	33406	Jonas is presently a special education assistant or para-professional in a urban high school and he is taking the undergraduate course , Critical Issues in School , to complete his degree . 	0
WD	33407	Second , special education students typically have some modifications or accommodations written in their Individualized Education Plan . 	0
WD	33408	For a special education student , this is magnified tremendously . 	0
WD	33409	Traditional students also try to refrain from asking questions in class because they don ' t want to look dumb . 	0
WD	33410	I say that because I love my country and it really bothers me to see our politicians drag us down further and further in to the abyss . 	0
WD	33411	When classes are filled with 36 to 40 students per class , one-on-one instruction becomes impossible . 	0
WD	33412	In addition , special education students tend to need more one-on-one instruction without distractions . 	0
WD	33413	This means that the students choose to take the test in class ‚Äî and have attention drawn to them because they get special treatment in other students eyes ‚Äî or they take their test in the testing center where they can have more privacy . 	0
WD	33414	Oftentimes , their plan allows them to use notes , a calculator and / or textbooks on tests . 	0
WD	33415	I pay taxes that go to the local school system that my children don ' t attend on both my residential property and business properties and I pay the private school tuition . 	0
WD	33416	"And as a parent of two "" youngest in the class "" , I wonder if these redshirt parents ' choice will be subjecting other children , who ' s parents followed the rules , to a school life of struggling to keep up with classmates that should actually be in another class ? "	0
WD	33417	I have always taken time to help as many students as possible , both traditional and special education students . 	0
WD	33418	Lastly , special education teachers catch on quickly which traditional teachers are going to take the time to help the kids on their case load . 	0
WD	33419	Redshirting - does it really buy your child a long-term advantage in school and in life ? 	0
WD	33420	We choose to be the primary influence in our children ‚Äô s life and know it is the right decision for our family . 	0
WD	33421	In fact , the National Home Education Research Institute disclosed that the 36 to 54 hours that students spend in school-related weekly activities make peers and adults outside of the home the primary influences in children ' s lives - not the parents . 	0
WD	33422	But lack of socialization for homeschoolers is really just a myth that holds no weight and is not a valid reason to not consider homeschooling . 	0
WD	33423	Each parent and family must make the decision to do what is best for them whether it be public school or homeschool . 	0
WD	33424	Mr . Safer also failed to examine the long-term effects of redshirting on children as the proceed thru their academic life . 	0
WD	33425	I sure hope somebody is out there studying these old , bigger , more mature students as they progress thru their school years ? 	0
WD	33426	I was all alone my freshmen year , by my senior year , there were enough high school homeschoolers to count on two hands . 	0
WD	33427	I think the best way to get Public schools to be better and for the system to be fairer is for parents to be given vouchers for the amount public schools would receive for your child ' s education and for the parents to have a choice of where to send their children . 	0
WD	33428	I think that where inclusion is being considered , it has to be carefully planned to meet the child¬ís needs . 	0
WD	33429	Just because the vast majority of home educators are good , loving and decent parents cannot mean that the few children at risk *must* be ignored to give you all privacy . 	0
WD	33430	The subjects were deemed too difficult to teach at home . 	0
WD	33431	Public schools will never get better until they have competition . 	0
WD	33432	so my kids should suffer for the school systems down fall while we figure it out . . . . news flash change takes time and you only have kids in school for a short time . . . . 	0
WD	33433	I wish . 	0
WD	33434	"No one is claiming "" the professionals "" are the only ones who can teach . "	0
WD	33435	Teachers in schools are also subject to intrusive checks , the assumption that they would abuse a child as soon as look at them and constant surveillance . 	0
WD	33436	I will always be happy they were happy there , despite my misery . 	0
WD	33437	And so children die . 	0
WD	33438	If no one is checking up , no one has noticed their child ' s bruises and withdrawal and misery . 	0
WD	33439	So , some parents take their children out of school and abuse them so they do not get caught . 	0
WD	33440	What this is about is when a child is being abused by parents , teachers notice and they report it . 	0
WD	33441	It is just a Get of Jail Free card to a very small minority of people . 	0
WD	33442	It is not a widespread problem , no one is claiming that . 	0
WD	33443	There is no way to tell who any of us would have been different without having the experience . 	0
WD	33444	Public schools have failed at their purpose because they have lost their purpose . 	0
WD	33445	Comes up in conversation ? 	0
WD	33446	I don ' t hide it . 	0
WD	33447	 they want to put her in G&T  -- now seriously , it ' s not jealousy - my ODD is identified gifted and I don ' t brag to the world about it . 	0
WD	33448	It ' s our deal . 	0
WD	33449	Got one friend who held her kid back in K because she was immature ( August birthday ) . 	0
WD	33450	"Now she ' s in 2nd and all I hear is "" she ' s so smart "" "" she ' s bored . "" "	0
WD	33451	But this holding them back because they are immature ? 	1
WD	33452	No way - not a good reason IMO . . . because they will grow up , , they will mature . 	1
WD	33453	"Also has anyone considered that maybe the reason many "" redshirted "" kids to not do as well academically is because their parents waited a year to start them because they did not feel they were ready and maybe they are just not academic performers . "	0
WD	33454	I ' m all for redshirting kids who are not academically ready . 	0
WD	33455	Nope , public school not for me ! 	1
WD	33456	Who in their right mind would want their children to have to rely on an education from one of those to prepare them for life ? 	0
WD	33457	You ' ve got to be kidding . 	0
WD	33458	The public school system the way it is now is not an option . 	1
WD	33459	Plus , I live in a right wing state whose legislators take books out of libraries on religious grounds and who tried to remove teaching the theory of evolution . 	0
WD	33460	This is still a country where your successes do provide some benefits . 	0
WD	33461	Education is one . 	0
WD	33462	I hope that the government doesn ' t make that impossible to . 	0
WD	33463	Just look at public schools . 	0
WD	33464	If you want what is best for your child , you ' ll send them to a private school . 	1
WD	33465	I think the idea that sending all children to public schools is a poor way to bring public education up to grade . 	0
WD	33466	Most would say , not at the expense of my child , and they would be right . 	0
WD	33467	The entire socialist mentality has no place here in the United States . 	0
WD	33468	I am going to be starting a single sex school but am not intimidated by this at all , as it was not just my parents choice but mine too , alot of people I know quite well go there and enjoy it tremendisly . 	0
WD	33469	Its just a debate that has two extremely good arguments on both sides 	0
WD	33470	Not sure how it would have turned out if we ' d sent him straight through , but I can attest that he is a leader in all things he does ‚Äì athletically , professionally , and socially . 	0
WD	33471	Testimony : My son , now 25 , was held back by going to Transitional first grade ( T1 ) . 	0
WD	33472	I believe that his going the T1 route was a part of what worked for us . 	0
WD	33473	He was awarded a full athletic college scholarship ; voted captain of his team by his teammates for three years , and earned another scholarship to get his masters ; and had several generous job offers to choose from upon graduating . 	0
WD	33474	I know it ' s a tough decision to make ‚Äì best of luck to those trying to make the decision , I know its tough and is different for each child . 	0
WD	33475	I am a loving , knowledgeable , intelligent and successful individual that wants to do all that I can to prepare my children and give them a great life . 	0
WD	33476	These parents are paying for public schools as well with tax dollars . 	0
WD	33477	People sending their kids to private schools and homeschooling actual helps the public schools . 	0
WD	33478	By helping pay for it , but not sending their children there , they are increasing the amount of funds that are available per student . 	0
WD	33479	Constitutionally , Canada has no religion , although some mistakenly believe we are a Christian nation even though legally that argument has no ground . 	0
WD	33480	Lets keep it that way . 	0
WD	33481	There is no place for religion in schools nor should taxpayers subsidize any religion ' s prayer services . 	1
WD	33482	I do not care if the person is Christian , Muslim , Jewish , Hindu , Zorastrian , Buddhist , Jainist , Wiccan , Protestant , Catholic , Orthodox , or Pagan their beliefs belong in premises financed by their believers not the government . 	0
WD	33483	My decision was based solely on those points as found by our exhaustive research of what was available to us in our area . 	0
WD	33484	Allowing prayer in schools leads to prosetylization and that is unacceptable . 	0
WD	33485	Nobody needs to be practicing religion at a public school . 	1
WD	33486	The whole point is to separate education from religion . 	0
WD	33487	If you want your kid learning and praying in the same place then send them to a religious school . 	0
WD	33488	if you had to do something and be child free during that time , the munchkins went to gramma or the teenage girl 3 doors down the block . 	0
WD	33489	your kid turned 5 , you sent them to KINDERGARTEN , boom , done . 	0
WD	33490	too often , parents are doing it because it ' s the done thing now , not because they have any sense that it will actually benefit their child ; someone said it was a good idea , so they did it . we didn ' t put our daughter in day care , pre-school , or 4K ; ppl thought we were nuts . 	0
WD	33491	now , parents do all this crap to give their kids a leg up , get them ahead of their peers , send them to umpteen different activities , get them in pre-school , and now this redshirting thing . 	0
WD	33492	dept . on the cheap , the dance classes , soccer , softball , on and on ad nauseum . 	0
WD	33493	this idea that kids need just one more year to be a kid . . . perhaps for some parents , there ' s some truth to it . when i was a kid , back in the dark ages , there wasn ' t day care , pre-school , 4 year old kindergarten , we didn ' t have all these things kids can do via the rec . 	0
WD	33494	there wasn ' t even the designation of 5K ; there was just KINDERGARTEN . 	0
WD	33495	when i was a kid , i was allowed to be a kid until kindergarten , where my mother had the choice of half day or full day kindergarten . 	0
WD	33496	There are many religions that do not pray to their gods , and some that don ' t have any gods whatsoever . 	0
WD	33497	2 ) The 1st amendment clearly establishes ( heh heh get it ) that the government may not sponsor a religion . 	0
WD	33498	One of the biggest myths about homeschooled kids is that they are poorly socialized . 	0
WD	33499	A study by the Canadian Center for Home Education found homeschooled young people at 15-34 years of age more socially engaged ( 67% ) compared with their public school educated peers ( 44% ) . 	0
WD	33500	It ' s not . 	0
WD	33501	4 ) It forces children to think that religion is okay . 	0
WD	33502	Prayer is solely religious in nature . 	0
WD	33503	3 ) Not only that , but the 1st amendment has been interpreted to mean that the government may not sponsor religion in general . 	0
WD	33504	I found it fascinating that homeschooled children , who are not being taught to the test , on the whole do much better than their public school counterparts . 	0
WD	33505	The statistics showing the higher test scores may be skewed because parents of homeschooled kids are not required to take or report scores for standardized tests in many states . 	0
WD	33506	Homeschooled students do have more time to pursue extracurricular activities as opposed to their exhausted public school peers . 	0
WD	33507	Teachers teach to the test because that is what they are instructed to do by administrations that are under pressure for government funding . 	0
WD	33508	Some parents bring in tutors or enroll their children in enrichment programs driving up the cost . 	0
WD	33509	Many parents recycle curriculum among siblings , get groups together for the group rate when visiting museums , and get free materials from the library or online to cut costs . 	0
WD	33510	In public school everyone must take standardized tests and schools must report the scores . 	0
WD	33511	The cost of homeschooling varies widely . 	0
WD	33512	It really is that simple . 	0
WD	33513	But the state ( including the public schools ) cannot mandate , sponsor , conduct , or otherwise officially sanction prayer . 	1
WD	33514	Private individuals can pray whenever and wherever they want ; no one ‚Äô s personal freedoms are being abridged in this regard . 	1
WD	33515	( They can ‚Äô t even offer to lead purely ‚Äú voluntary ‚Äù prayers with an ‚Äú opt out ‚Äù option for non-praying students ; that ‚Äô s still a form of religious participation and support , on an official basis , by the state ‚Äî which is flatly unconstitutional ) . 	0
WD	33516	Ergo , public schools ( e . g . , the state ) may not lead or conduct prayers . 	0
WD	33517	U . S . public schools , being government-run and taxpayer-supported , are part of ‚Äú the state . ‚Äù 	0
WD	33518	The state may not establish , endorse , promote , sponsor , or conduct prayers . 	0
WD	33519	Individuals may freely exercise their religion of choice , and give free expression to their own private religious preferences ; however , the state cannot do likewise ( because the U . S . Constitution also mandates that the state may not promote , endorse , or otherwise ‚Äú establish ‚Äù religion ) . 	0
WD	33520	However , teachers on duty in public schools are not acting as private individuals , but as employees ( and hence representatives ) of the state . 	0
WD	33521	It is sometimes objected that teachers ‚Äô rights of religious expression and free speech are being violated , if they are forbidden to lead students in prayer . 	0
WD	33522	However , when they want to pray out loud or with a group , I consider that a disruption and therefore not acceptable . 	0
WD	33523	While one child may be an extreme extrovert and need to be surrounded by students and in a classroom , another may be an extreme introvert , overwhelmed and anxious in the classroom . 	0
WD	33524	"The private and Catholic schools were grew out of the need created because the public schools sucked "" first "" . "	0
WD	33525	If the failing public schools were to suddenly get better because the parents whose kids are ' stuck ' there demanded better , likely the parents of private school kids would put their kids back in public schools . 	0
WD	33526	If the problems could be solved by more involved parents ( and a majority of them probably can be ) , then put the onus on the remaining parents to rise up and get more involved . 	0
WD	33527	You ' re blaming people who choose to walk away in disgust ( often while paying tax money ANYWAY to subsidize failure ) yet ignoring the obvious . 	0
WD	33528	IF this were true , then why don ' t the parents whose kids ARE in the public school system work to improve it ? 	0
WD	33529	They deserve better . 	0
WD	33530	If the atmosphere in the school is right , if the pastoral care excellent than I feel that the co-ed environment creates a vibrant , exciting , stimulating school but also a more relaxed and less stressful climate . 	0
WD	33531	As a boy in a boarding school myself many years ago , which was single sex until A levels , the arrival of girls in the sixth form was the worst possible distraction to teenage boys about to embark serious exams . 	0
WD	33532	Girls also feel the pressure of exam much more than boys and in their teenage years exam pressure can become very intense with often very serious negative consequences . 	0
WD	33533	My experience in a secondary co-ed is that the co-ed situation does deflect some of this tension . 	0
WD	33534	But in my opinion it should be from 2-18 . 	0
WD	33535	Boys and girls perhaps learn differently and approach work in different ways . 	0
WD	33536	If a school is aware of this and teachers can adapt styles and vary their teaching strategies ‚Äì I see co-eds as both a more natural and realistic preparation for the fast approaching lesson of adult life . 	1
WD	33537	This can cause children to not experience as much about society and those different from them as they would in a public or private school setting . 	0
WD	33538	Experiences are left out of childhood that could have been gained through attendance at school in a multicultural classroom . 	0
WD	33539	Finances Finances can be difficult for families when children are homeschooled . 	0
WD	33540	"With one parent teaching children in the comfort of your own home , the other is left to be sole "" breadwinner , "" and that can place a burden on a family ' s budget . "	0
WD	33541	Many schools also provide a free lunch to students in order to aid families during this tough economic time , something that cannot be offered while homeschooling . 	0
WD	33542	Isolation from Differences Children are isolated from differences in race , ethnicity , age and culture when being homeschooled . 	0
WD	33543	Ideally , I don ‚Äô t think school children should spend as much time as they usually do isolated by age , let alone sex . 	1
WD	33544	The unhealthiest social situations I was ever in were an all-boys school and military training . 	0
WD	33545	In a rough analogy to monocultural farming , I think than any highly homogeneous group of people , while it offers certain efficiencies , is inherently pathology prone . 	0
WD	33546	Diversity damps extremes of outlook , need and behavior . 	0
WD	33547	She compares the push toward mainstreaming students from special education classes to the 1980s movement to downsize mental health institutes , which resulted in an increase in homelessness because individuals could no long receive needed supports . 	0

WD	33549	Dr . Densmore doesn ‚Äô t believe that holding kids back from kindergarten entry is the total solution . 	0
WD	33550	Lesson plans ( and the national curriculum ) are the death of real education . 	0
WD	33551	Others may differ , but I always think , isn ‚Äô t high school supposed to transition you into the world , college , and life on your own ? 	0
WD	33552	Girls were said to be hitting a self-esteem barrier in junior high , when they would droop like Ophelias in need of reviving . 	0
WD	33553	The reformers ‚Äô talk was all about ‚Äú How Schools Shortchange Girls ‚Äù ( the title of a much-discussed report from the American Association of University Women ) or were ‚Äú Failing at Fairness ‚Äù ( the title of a 1994 book ) for young women . 	0
WD	33554	My view on the subject is no . 	1
WD	33555	and I actually do feel like co-ed schools develop a girl better socially and emotionally than all-girls schools , just from the mere fact that a girl will get to interact with boys on a daily basis . 	0
WD	33556	As Halpern and her co-authors point out , there are some excellent single-sex programs , and some can point to real gains , but often these can be attributed to selection bias‚Äîthe children involved were more committed students‚Äîand to the motivation and sense of mission among teachers and staff . 	0
WD	33557	In an article called , bluntly , ‚Äú The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling , ‚Äù which was co-authored by Diane Halpern , a research psychologist at Claremont McKenna college , and published in Science magazine this fall , Halpern et al . conclude that ‚Äú there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students ‚Äô academic performance . ‚Äù 	0
WD	33558	A woman whose daughters attend one of the West Virginia middle schools with boys ‚Äô and girls ‚Äô classes contributed an article this week to the A . C . L . U . Web site in which she pointed out that her school ‚Äô s all-male classes operated on the humane assumption that many kids concentrate better if they ‚Äô re permitted to move about a bit . 	0
WD	33559	When I was reporting on single-sex education experiments in the nineties , one of the things I noticed was that teaching methods enthusiastically billed as better for girls , like hands-on science demonstrations , or mixing word problems in with more standard equations , would be better for anyone without a natural bent for math or science . 	0
WD	33560	She thought , reasonably enough , that some girls might benefit from a little of the same freedom . 	0
WD	33561	In the boys ‚Äô classes , students could lounge in beanbag chairs and run around outside sometimes to ‚Äú blow off steam . ‚Äù 	0
WD	33562	In the nineties , it was girls . 	0
WD	33563	What has changed since the nineties is the notion of who single-sex education is supposed to help most . 	0
WD	33564	We should make the public system as good as possible for those who can ' t afford it but if parents want their kids to get a better education than the system provides don ' t stop them . 	0
WD	33565	I went to a private school and the public system could never have given me the same experience and quality education . 	0
WD	33566	The government doesn ' t have to intervene in everything . 	0
WD	33567	He enjoys his preschool activities but if he had to do everything over again , I envision lots of fussing about going to school . 	0
WD	33568	Mornings would be ugly . 	0
WD	33569	Besides , the biggest detriment of preschool boredom is associating disinterest with school . 	0
WD	33570	No one wants a kid to develop the habit of tuning out . 	0
WD	33571	Ryan also is like me in that he ‚Äô s observant and listening intensely , although if you didn ‚Äô t know him , or me , you might think we ‚Äô re not paying attention . 	0
WD	33572	But trust me , we have mentally filed away every detail of interest and can almost recite word-for-word what was said . 	0
WD	33573	Here ‚Äô s another thing : A bored Ryan is trouble waiting to happen . 	0
WD	33574	I cannot imagine him spending a year not moving forward with his learning . 	0
WD	33575	They pay most , if not all of the taxes that support the socialistic schools . 	0
WD	33576	Just who do you think pays for the schools ? 	0
WD	33577	A very few excel , but they are the type who would have exceled even without schooling , so they exceled in spite of public schools . 	0
WD	33578	I went to both single sex and co-ed high schools , and I feel the later made it easier to build cross gender friendships that weren ' t just hormone driven . 	0
WD	33579	I believe that envy is one of the carnal sins . 	0
WD	33580	It ' d be good to read up on the literature . 	0
WD	33581	My first thoughts are that it would be more likely to produce an objectified view even with regular cross school events . 	0
WD	33582	Yes , private school is expensive but not every parent that sends their kid to private school is well to do . 	0
WD	33583	My husband and I both work and make good money , but allowing him to go to private school took some thought in regards to our budget . 	0
WD	33584	I suggest reading a blog I wrote earlier this year titled ‚Äú Parents , Sports and Church . ‚Äù 	0

WD	33591	My son who at the end of his Freshman year had a GPA of 3 . 8 excelled as well but he was stressed out for 90% of the year because of the classroom sizes . 	0
WD	33592	He would come home so frustrated because the teacher spent most of the class trying to get everyone to focus and pay attention that by the time the bell rang to go to the next class they were left to figure out the lesson for the day on their own or go to tutoring after school which is what he would do . 	0

WD	33604	Please stop , reverse your decision and realize that religion , all religions , have no use in our education system , our government and technically speaking ( even those whom are dedicated to their faith ) 98% of the hours with a calendar year . 	1

WD	33606	"these few children who are really JUST not ready for prime time , maybe i can see it , IF these kids are doing something to help them in w / e area they are lacking , but to do it for sports , or just because they need that one extra year to "" just be a kid "" ? "	0

WD	33609	If Muslims are required by their religion to pray several ( is it 6 ? ) times a day , and this space is being allotted so the Muslim youth can practice their religion properly . . . why is this prayer only being conducted once per week ? 	0
WD	33610	This timetable would seem in opposition of what their faith demands . 	0
WD	33611	I am convinced more satisfaction is gained from the fact that they will be allowed to halfheartedly practice their faith in a public school rather than actually practicing their faith properly an a place of worship . 	0

WD	33657	Our culture has declared war on children in so many ways . 	0
WD	33658	Let ‚Äô s take a look at this . 	0
WD	33659	There seems to be a myth that homeschoolers do not receive proper socialization . 	0
WD	33660	This usually comes from people who do not understand homeschooling or those deeply involved in public education . 	0
WD	33661	In reality , the majority of homeschoolers are provided with plenty of social opportunities . 	0
WD	33662	There has been much discussion regarding homeschooling lately . 	0
WD	33663	He has had no problems so far in Kindergarten . 	0
WD	33664	As a homeschooling parent of five children for over a decade , the most frequent question I receive is , ‚Äú what about socialization ? ‚Äù 	0
WD	33665	A woman recently contacted me saying she desired to homeschool her child but the socialization issue was keeping her from doing so . 	0
WD	33666	Well , getting drunk before basketball games with kids who lived at the trailer park near my house did the same for me . 	0
WD	33667	Reading Walt Whitman in ninth grade changed the way you see the world ? 	0
WD	33668	As rotten as my school ‚Äô s English , history , science , social studies , math , art , music , and language programs were , going to school with poor kids and rich kids , black kids and brown kids , smart kids and not-so-smart ones , kids with superconservative Christian parents and other upper-middle-class Jews like me was its own education and life preparation . 	0
WD	33669	I ' m happy with my choice and it was comforting to read this article of support for my decision . 	1
WD	33670	Take two things from this on your quest to become a better person : 1 ) Your child will probably do just fine without ‚Äú the best , ‚Äù so don ‚Äô t freak out too much , but 2 ) do freak out a little more than my parents did‚Äîenough to get involved . 	0
WD	33671	( Can you imagine ? ) 	0
WD	33672	They sent me there because that ‚Äô s where we lived , and they weren ‚Äô t too worried about it . 	0
WD	33673	By the way : My parents didn ‚Äô t send me to this shoddy school because they believed in public ed . 	0
WD	33674	My son turned 5 one week before the cut-off . 	0
WD	33675	Many of my ( morally bankrupt ) colleagues send their children to private schools . 	0
WD	33676	He is in a full day Kindergarten and seems to be doing well , considering he is the youngest in the class . 	0
WD	33677	In reality , children and teens are locked behind gates on campus , are segregated by age , are forced to remain silent in class unless called by the teacher , and whose schedules are determined by the blare of school bells . 	0
WD	33678	In contrast , a homeschooler ‚Äô s ‚Äú classroom ‚Äù is the world around him / her . 	0
WD	33679	Parents don ‚Äô t just limit teaching their children in the living or dining room . 	0
WD	33680	They hold lessons in parks , libraries or museums . 	0
WD	33681	However , Dr . Thomas Smedley debunked these assumptions when he did a study on homeschooled kids . 	0
WD	33682	Last year , his pre-school teacher recommended that I hold him back and keep him in Pre-K one more year . 	0
WD	33683	Homeschooled children scored very high in the 84th percentile compared to public school students who scored at an abysmal 23rd percentile . 	0

WD	33687	Indeed , parents ensure that their kids are able to interact with people of all ages , and not just with their peers . 	0
WD	33688	If you want to chat with your invisible , supernatural friend do so off school property and on your own time . 	0

WD	33690	NO PRAYER IN SCHOOLS ! . . . period . 	1
WD	33691	While there are many arguments for homeschooling children , there are several reasons that parents might not want to pursue this educational option . 	0
WD	33692	This large step should be considered carefully before children are either homeschooled or enrolled at a public institution . 	0
WD	33693	Homeschooling allows children to move at their own learning pace , yet it can socially isolate them . 	0
WD	33694	Homeschooling is beneficial for some , but may not be right for every family . 	0
WD	33695	Also , teaching itself can be difficult , as parents usually haven ' t earned a degree in education and occasionally they don ' t even have any kind of post-secondary education . 	0
WD	33696	Social Networks Children who are homeschooled can lack the social interaction gained by having classmates . 	0
WD	33697	Teaching Many parents find the variety of choices and lesson plans that can be used for homeschooling overwhelming . 	0
WD	33698	Since there are no laid out plans for teaching , homeschooling can be a great deal of work for parents , and occasionally confusing for children . 	0
WD	33699	This can be difficult for children as they can be socially isolated unless parents create their own social groups through sports , extracurricular activities or religious organizations . 	0
WD	33700	The value of learning how to get along with others and develop social skills that will be needed throughout life is an important part of the education experience . 	0
WD	33701	My child changes every year and so will his needs . 	1
WD	33702	So bored ! 	0
WD	33703	NONE . 	0

WD	33708	I have seen it from all angles and am now seeing it from the parent ' s angle . 	1
WD	33709	Actually , my son had a homeschooled boy on his hockey team for several years . 	0
WD	33710	Home educated children are also more involved in their communities , as are adults who were homeschooled . 	0
WD	33711	The top reason my friends say they didn ‚Äô t consider homeschooling is because they are sure their kids won ‚Äô t listen to them . 	0
WD	33712	He socialized just fine and was exceptionally bright , though judging from his fascination with my garage door opener , seemed a bit sheltered . 	0
WD	33713	Many readers addressed this saying it ‚Äô s a matter of discipline and good parenting . 	0
WD	33714	I have to say , I ‚Äô m with them . 	0
WD	33715	Someone out there should start a consulting business teaching parents how to get their kids to listen to them while homeschooling . 	0
WD	33716	Although there is a huge homeschool community out there that makes it work , I still can ‚Äô t imagine my boys cooperating . 	0
WD	33717	Christian prayer in schools is not a problem because the Christian holy day of the week is Sunday - a day when there is no school . 	0
WD	33718	He went in a boy and came out a god-loving man of character ! 	0
WD	33719	The subject of homeschool shouldn ' t open a firestorm of debate anymore than mentioning a child is going to public school opens a debate . 	0
WD	33720	This is after all a free country . 	0
WD	33721	It depends on what you think a Christian is . 	0
WD	33722	There are too many who try to use the government and our schools to force their religion on everyone . 	0
WD	33723	Not surpirsingly the worst behavior problems are lower potential and high potential students . 	0
WD	33724	But you are free to carry a Bible until you use it to violate the rights of others . 	0
WD	33725	Well , of course the whole Bible isn ' t mythology . 	0
WD	33726	There is some religious laws , there is a lot of poetry , there is some history , and there is a lot of mythology . 	0
WD	33727	How else should Genesis be characterized ? 	0
WD	33728	Nonsense . 	0
WD	33729	As an agent of the government you would be enjoined from giving the appearance that the government endorsed or supported a particular religion . 	0
WD	33730	I believe that there has been case law on the matter in which a teacher was dismissed for putting a Bible on the desk . 	0
WD	33731	Carry it in your brief case , but to take it out and place it promenently on the desk every day crosses the line . 	0
WD	33732	My child went to a private all boys school and it was the best thing I ever did ! 	1
WD	33733	As a teacher , this is a moral and ethical struggle for me . 	0
WD	33734	In public school , the parents nor the teachers have too much say in the government run institutions ! 	0
WD	33735	I don ' t know if I agree that a parent has to be super organized , so much as motivated . 	0
WD	33736	( though organization does help . ) 	0
WD	33737	This is why I work to support my family rather than work to support a random group of my fellow human beings . 	0
WD	33738	Ergo , if I have kids that I love and I live in a place with a crappy school district , you ' re damn right I ' m going to put them in a private school if I ' m able to do it . 	1
WD	33739	I ' m not going to ship them off to some crappy public just so I can use them as a tool for making a sociopolitical point . 	0
WD	33740	When preparing for a test , the boys may go for a run , or engage in some other activity , while the girls are more likely to do calming exercises , such as yoga . ‚Äù 	0
WD	33741	The writer is an idiot . 	0
WD	33742	As a responsible , rational , moral human being , I have a hierarchy of responsibility . 	0
WD	33743	I have a responsibility to my society but I also have a responsibility to my family . 	0
WD	33744	My responsibility to my family trumps my responsibility to society . 	0
WD	33745	I ‚Äô m not saying it ‚Äô s a good thing that I got a lame education . 	0
WD	33746	"I think that as a parent you really have to commit to x amount of hours a day HAVE to be designated for school , and it is really easy to be like "" Well , we ' ll get back on track tomorrow . "" "	0
WD	33747	Girls thrive on team projects and collaboration ; boys on bright lights , loud voices , and competition . 	0
WD	33748	I ‚Äô m saying that I survived it , and so will your child , who must endure having no AP calculus so that in 25 years there will be AP calculus for all . 	0
WD	33749	This year it may be homeschool . 	1
WD	33750	Isn ' t this an interesting country we live in when we have to justify practicing our religious freedoms ! 	0
WD	33751	In a study conducted by Dr . Michael Mitchell , traits for successful socialization in students include popularity among peers , aggressive competitiveness , pride and self-confidence , and a drive toward materialism . 	0
WD	33752	A second point to consider is that there is an obvious discrepancy between public school educators and homeschoolers on what traits define successful socialization . 	0
WD	33753	It ‚Äô s amazing how much more emotionally mature a six year old is . 	0
WD	33754	With this in mind I feel it does no harm to wait till he ‚Äô s six . 	1
WD	33755	You son sounds like he ‚Äô s much more ready intelligence wise but not emotionally wise . 	0
WD	33756	He wasn ‚Äô t ready for kindergarten though . 	0
WD	33757	I know my oldest was and it ‚Äô s just now in the fourth grade that he ‚Äô s really catching up to his peers . 	0
WD	33758	He sounds like he ‚Äô s mostly ready , but like you said he would be one of the youngest in his class . 	0
WD	33759	I think you really have to know your own child . 	0
WD	33760	As I stated earlier , mainstream was the right move for me , however I do not regret my time spent in The Court . 	0
WD	33761	To my mind , this is not an issue with a quick fix solution , nor are there any definitive answers on what ‚Äô s better for disabled children . 	0
WD	33762	This means that teachers can spend more time on each pupil , answering any questions or concerns they may have about the tasks set . 	0
WD	33763	In contrast , homeschoolers want their children to focus on building character and integrity , developing a sense of responsibility , and respect toward others ‚Äì ideals of Christian living . 	0
WD	33764	So I would argue that all provision for disabled pupils ( and students ) needs defending whether its special schools , SEN ( special education needs ) departments in mainstream schools or learning support assistants . 	0
WD	33765	To that end , the ‚Äò integration vs . segregation ‚Äô argument simply becomes an argument that is abstract and separate from reality . 	0
WD	33766	I feel that it is almost certain that ‚Äò special ‚Äô education will always be necessary for some school-students and ultimately it is their needs which should form the focus of this debate . 	0
WD	33767	It provided me with the first steps in my education . 	0
WD	33768	I hope disabled people , carers , teachers and parents can consider this possibility the next time this debate arises . 	0
WD	33769	The drift toward private schools was predicted as far back at the mid 1980s when I first became a teacher . 	0
WD	33770	At public it ' s payment in full at private it ' s payment in full or pay the difference . 	0
WD	33771	It was said that a ' voucher system ' would eventually be put in place , where by the funding attached to each student would ' travel ' with the student . 	0
WD	33772	Not surprisingly , delinquent and antisocial behaviors are practically non-existent in homeschooled children . 	0
WD	33773	This meant that the public school funding would be dependent upon demand from the community . 	0
WD	33774	" If he ' s older , he won ' t be easily manipulated into drug use and malpractices like this . 	0
WD	31788	As a publicly educated teacher I was concerned about the genesis of ' schools of last resort ' . 	0
WD	31789	He might feel more confident dealing with older students ,  she said . "	0
WD	33775	Just as Gibb made a choice depending on her son ' s emotional needs , Vela recommends that parents do the same . 	0
WD	33776	I don ' t necessarily think that social skills or academics should be a sole deciding factor when figuring out when to start school . 	0
WD	33777	If she was down one grade it wouldn ' t make much difference socially since she is SO far off , but she would be further ahead with academics , totally bored , and would have other issues there as a result . 	0
WD	33778	She is a 13 year-old 8th grader with a fall birthday who is at or above level academically . 	0
WD	33779	If my oldest was in the grade where she fits SOCIALLY she would be in 3rd or 4th . 	0
WD	33780	You will also always have someone at the top and at the bottom when it comes to academics . 	0
WD	33781	It doesn ' t matter what the cut-off date is , there will always be someone who falls into each of those categories whether they are one and the same or not . 	0
WD	33782	Someone always has to be the youngest and someone always has to be the most immature . 	0
WD	33783	Tracy Gibb , a mother , blogger of Less than Perfect , deliberately redshirted her son because she thought he was emotionally immature . 	0
WD	33784	My wife and I also wanted our daughter to receive an education in Christ and that ' s a big reason we sent her to Christian private school . 	0
WD	33785	"I often spent 20 mins of each year 9 lesson getting the boys to stop aggravating the ADHD boy , as he would then "" blow "" , much to the amusement of everyone . "	0
WD	33786	Certain schools by us have opened the doors to ESL , and now every lowlife transfers to the great school and destroys the curriculum at that school . 	0
WD	33787	 When he complains about his friend , I always try to remind him that he is one year younger than him and that he was doing the same things last year ,  Gibb told ABCNews . com . 	0
WD	33788	"Gibb still thinks she made the right choice not only because her son was "" emotionally immature , "" but also because she did not want him to join high school or college at a very young age . "	0
WD	33789	GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS . 	0
WD	33790	YOU WANT TO FIX THE PATHETIC PUBLIC SCHOOLS . . . . 	0
WD	33791	I guess I choose to be a bad person and go with private schooling . 	1
WD	33792	So lets see I have a choice of sending my kids to a private school ; or better yet of homeschooling them and raising intelligent indivuals who can think for themselves and make intelligent decisions when they become adults or I can send them to public schools and play a role in raising more federal libtard zombies who question nothing and can carry on the torch of the last two generations of people destroying this once great country . 	0
WD	33793	The hell with do they know how to read , write , etc . The question is do you agree with the homosexual agenda , do you 5th graders know how to put on a condom , Christianity is evil but don ' t hurt the sweet people of Isam ' s feeling because after all they are part of the religion of peace . 	0
WD	33794	Should I send my kids to school where they can learn NOT how to READ , WRITE , SPELL , do MATH , SCIENCE , HISTORY , but learn how to think the way the Liberal federal government wants them too . 	0
WD	33795	Lets see here . 	0
WD	33796	Hmmm . . . . 	0
WD	33797	there ' s no social advantage at all ; the best place to learn to be social with kids of all ages is a school ! 	0
WD	33798	there ' s no academic advantage to keeping your kid out of school for an extra year , if all you do is put them in some kind of kiddie college , or if you won ' t or can ' t teach them on your own . 	0
WD	33799	all this pressure i see on other kids , and where ' s the benefit ? 	0
WD	33800	she takes one dance class , 45 minutes every saturday , because she asked if she could , not because i think it ' s good for much of anything ; she likes to dance and maybe she ' ll learn to not be such a clod . 	0
WD	33801	i am in the somewhat , these days , enviable position of being a stay at home mom , and i am a nerdy book worm , so it ' s easy enough for me to fill her time at home with education , and in such a way that she doesn ' t think she ' s being taught , ha ha sneaky mom . 	0
WD	33802	what DO you do , if you hold them back that first year ? 	0
WD	33803	the flip side is the parents who HAVE to put their kids in day care and pre-school , because they both work , and how many of them really find that their kids are SO much better off when they finally start school ? 	0
WD	33804	how many of the redshirted kids have parents who can do that , as opposed to paying for extracurricular programs ? 	0
WD	33805	but , no , i don ' t see it . if you want your kid to just be a kid , DON ' T put them in all these activities , unless they ASK to do them . 	0
WD	33806	i have not found one study that shows any tangible benefit to redshirting , and yes , i have looked , because it made no sense to me when i first heard of it , but i thought maybe there was some validity to the idea just the same . 	0
WD	33807	But , say a classmate has died . 	0
WD	33808	If the government actually spent money on the school system instead of other things that would be different . 	0
WD	33809	If prayer really works , then students might turn to God and come to know His love and forgiveness . 	0
WD	33810	Alliance Defending Freedom stands with See You at the Pole and with every student who desires to call upon the name of God . 	0
WD	33811	My husband helped update plumbing . 	0
WD	33812	If prayer didn ‚Äô t work , then a group of students gathering around a flagpole early in the morning to talk to God would pose no threat . 	0
WD	33813	If prayer didn ‚Äô t work , then FFRF would not find it ‚Äú unfortunate ‚Äù that students are encouraged to ‚Äú reach out to [ their ] classmates who do not know God ‚Äô s love and forgiveness . ‚Äù 	0
WD	33814	In 2006 , then Education Secretary Margaret Spellings eased federal regulations on the policy , allowing schools to offer single-sex classrooms and schools so as long as these options are completely voluntary . 	0
WD	33815	If prayer really works , then it is a threat to those who would seek to corrupt a generation of students into embracing a godless worldview . 	0
WD	33816	The theme of this year ‚Äô s See You at the Pole is #IFTHEN . 	0
WD	33817	And during a moment of silence , cannot some students pray and others reflect ? 	0
WD	33818	To FFRF and groups like it , the threat of prayer at school is the ‚Äú then . ‚Äù 	0
WD	33819	The threat is that when students pray , then God responds . 	0
WD	33820	The say and decisions are directed by leader of the system who reports to the state education system . . . not to parents . 	0
WD	33821	As such this leaves little room for parental suggestion let alone parental say in the class . 	0
WD	33822	This is where money talks , if you want to make a change or have a say in your child ' s education this will take either you teaching them yourself or paying someone else to teach them the way you believe is best ( private school ) . 	1
WD	33823	The author assumes parents can change a public system . 	0
WD	33824	The flaw . 	0
WD	33825	If it were the ins and outs of the school would be to serve the parents . . it is not it is to serve and teach the children . 	0
WD	33826	This is not so . 	0
WD	33827	This worked really well . 	0
WD	33828	On top of all this , we also paid taxes to the public school . 	0
WD	33829	I think it is really destructive when inclusion fails . 	0
WD	33830	It is better to build up to inclusion gradually where possible . 	0
WD	33831	I can see disallowing vocal prayer . 	1
WD	33832	A school is a public institution . 	0
WD	33833	It might offend some people . 	0
WD	33834	Inconsiderate bigots . 	0
WD	33835	What about the other children who believe in a different religion or have no religion ? 	0
WD	33836	But , of course . 	0
WD	33837	These types of Christians only care about themselves and THEIR beliefs . 	0
WD	33838	To hell with everyone else . 	0
WD	33839	The schools and government seem to think that my children belong to them . 	0
WD	33840	When I went to the schools about my children I was treated like an interloper and talked down to as if I was beneath them . 	0
WD	33841	As with any generalization , there are exceptions to the rule , but this is what I have seen . 	0

WD	33888	Taken together , the risk of Leo becoming bored outweighs any concerns I have about him socially . 	0
WD	33889	In some ways being surrounded by older kids is much easier because they tend to be more prosocial and they model social skills from which Leo can benefit . 	0
WD	33890	But , at this point he keeps up well with friends who are a year or more older , and prefers their company to kids who are a few months younger . 	0
WD	33891	Socially , I do wonder if being older would be helpful for him , especially since in adolescence it is socially advantageous for boys to hit puberty early ( it is risk factor for girls ) because that means physical strength . 	0
WD	33892	After his first day of preschool he was disappointed because ‚Äú I didn ‚Äô t learn anything . ‚Äù 	0

WD	33938	Particularly for parents of only children , these issues often take nightmarish proportions ( and probably rightly so ) considering the deep care and protectiveness they offer their child . 	0
WD	33939	The principle seems straightforward ‚Äì through registration , all home-educated children would become visible to the authorities , who could then protect them ‚Äì and ensure that the education being received is adequate . 	0
WD	33940	If you want children to pray at school , there are plenty of Catholic and other private schools available . 	0

WD	33942	I have seen in the public system , where a principal would give candy to the children that act up , to not do it again . 	0
WD	33943	It ' s ironic to me that the folks most likely to kvetch about all those worthless teachers and teachers unions are the ones who will then turn around and demand those teachers should be able to lead their students in prayer . 	0
WD	33944	"Let me say , as a parent and as a Christian , I don ' t want my daughter ' s teacher or her principal or her classmates leading her in prayer in school ‚Äî including what someone else might consider "" good Christian prayer "" or else some watered-down pablum generic invocation . "	1

WD	33963	There is a time and a place for everything , including religion . 	0
WD	33964	I am not sure if this is already the case , but I believe that it would serve the State well to treat homeschooling as a type of private school and require that they meet the same standards as those registered facilities . 	0
WD	33965	I am involved as a parent , why is it that we have religion in Jails but not in the public school system . 	0
WD	33966	There ' s no doubt boys behave a little different when girls are watching , and i also found boys were quite good at limiting the bitchyness girls are renowned for . 	0
WD	33967	Some parents may see this as an invasion of their privacy and an intrusion , but the State has a responsibility to ensure that all children living in this country are properly educated . 	0
WD	33968	So both kept one another in line , and made for a more positive and dynamic environment . 	0
WD	33969	I also think there ' s a few extra life lessons and skills children can learn at co ed schools . 	0
WD	33970	Public schools have kicked prayer and Christ out and now their working on the pledge of allegiance . 	0
WD	33971	Really I ' m bad because I want my daughter to know Christ . 	0
WD	33972	Dating , relationships , interacting with the opposite sex , i think children at co ed schools tend to have a far better grasp of these skills then students who ' ve only attended same sex schools . 	0
WD	33973	So what makes your average mom or dad think they can do my job with no degree and no experience ? 	0
WD	33974	The unpleasant fact is that parents who want to abuse children have ample opportunity wherever their children ' s education is taking place . 	0
WD	33975	Public School is not the place for religion , unless we are doing a Comparative Religions course , in which all views are examined . 	1
WD	33976	"Parents today can shell out some cash and skip the "" Reform Period "" by going private . "	0
WD	33977	I was a product of the public school system , and yes , they are very necessary . 	0
WD	33978	Secondly , banning school prayer can in no way be seen as somehow rejecting or abandoning the alleged divine protection that schools would otherwise enjoy , as such theological criticisms always seem to intend to imply . 	0
WD	33979	That in itself clearly does not transform schools into ‚Äú God-free zones ‚Äù ; banning schools from leading prayers , like banning schools from teaching religious doctrines such as creationism or posting religious rules such as the Ten Commandments , merely ensures that public schools remain religiously neutral environments , for students of every religion or no religion . 	0
WD	33980	For proof of this , all one need do is to recall the 2006 shooting spree which occurred in an Amish school in Pennsylvania . 	0
WD	33981	Officially implementing mandatory school prayers in no way offers a divine guarantee against school shootings from occurring . 	0
WD	33982	And this tragedy occurred despite the fact that community-based Amish schools ( which are not public schools ) conduct morning Bible readings and daily prayers . 	0
WD	33983	Or you could stop being so selfish to the child and send it out into the world so it can learn the importance of society and how to ineract with it . . . an education is often only useful if you know how to work with people using it . 	0
WD	33984	I ' m sure you are , but there are plenty that aren ' t . 	0
WD	33985	what like making sure you are fit to teach a child responsibly . . 	0
WD	33986	The girls in my year just had entirely different interests . 	0
WD	33987	In terms of results ; I really think it ' s mostly up to the individual and how driven they are , coupled together with a good teacher , as to whether or not they do well . 	0
WD	33988	Most of the people I have spoken to who have attended an all-girls school would have chosen to go co-ed had they been given another chance . 	0
WD	33989	I myself went to a co-ed , and am so glad I was able to ‚Äì I only had a few close female friends , because I was way more comfortable hanging out with the boys ‚Äì I just preferred playing sport during breaks than gossiping about what happened over the weekend . 	0
WD	33990	But there is also a case to be made for parents who wish to home-school their children . 	1
WD	33991	We in Barbados think of homeschooling as an activity that occurs only in North American countries or perhaps further afield , and cannot imagine why in a country that offers free education to all school aged children , a parent would want to take on the responsibility of teaching their child . 	0
WD	33992	The curriculum is much more hands on and students learn more . 	0
WD	33993	I am all for the public school system . 	1
WD	33994	It is a question I used to ask myself some years ago , until I recognised that the school environment of today is much more explosive than it was just a few decades ago . 	0
WD	33995	I would respectfully recommend you actually take the time to learn about home-schooling before posting such ignorant and hateful words but alas , the products of a liberal and intolerant educational system cannot possibly fathom such a possibility . 	0
WD	33996	Ah yes , the shining examples of the ignorance of home-schooling is well displayed in the majority of these posts . 	0
WD	33997	A second reason I deplore single sex schools is that girls and women are shortchanged as far as math and science are concerned . 	0
WD	33998	This is a skill that is not learned in a single sex environment . 	0
WD	33999	In order to get along in adult society most occupations require that their practitioners get along with both men and women . 	0
WD	34000	They learn to regard members of the opposite sex as people . 	0
WD	34001	In a coed school children deal with each other as individuals . 	0
WD	34002	It will no doubt require that officials of the Ministry of Education create measures to guide parents opting to go this route , and by extension require them to visit these homes to observe what is being done . 	0
WD	34003	One thing that I hope all people learn in school is to get along with other people . 	0
WD	34004	I regard single sex education as bad . 	1
WD	34005	"‚Äú It ‚Äô s the isolation that allows it to exist . "" "	0
WD	34006	One friend of mine , a product of a girl ' s high school , had to take remedial courses so that she could satisfactorily take college level science course . 	0
WD	34007	My observations of women who were products of girls schools is that they do not have the same preparation that women who are products of coed schools do . 	0
WD	34008	So if we add Friday to the weekend , then Muslims can go to the mosque on Friday , and not have to choose between going to school , or going to worship . 	0
WD	34009	It ‚Äô s simple ! 	0
WD	34010	Now , there are pros and cons for each . 	0
WD	34011	"But I feel that the co-ed school is more "" natural "" and its pros outweigh its cons more than the all-girls school . "	0
WD	34012	Otherwise , any discussion of religion should be strictly technical . 	0
WD	34013	I switched to an all-girls school in the 10th grade and stayed until I finished high school . 	0
WD	34014	First of all , those of us who send our children to private schools are also paying for the public schools at the same time through our property taxes . 	0
WD	34015	I can not tell you how many times I have come across teachers with over inflated egos . 	0
WD	34016	Schools are not always bad because of funding etc . Sometimes they are un areas that are mismanaged or just have bad teachers . 	0
WD	34017	Good schools draw good students regardless of a private or public classification . 	0
WD	34018	They think they are a parent and saving the world of their students , when really they are incapable of passing on any amount of knowledge . 	0
WD	34019	But there ' s always going to be a difference of maturity between different individuals , whether male or female . 	0
WD	34020	My father continues to deny my condition to this day and like many disabled children in mainstream schools I was bullied . 	0
WD	34021	Girls are more mature than boys generally , yes . 	0
WD	34022	And personally , I was always more mature than most of the other girls , too . 	0
WD	34023	Since you can no longer pray at school or discuss God , I choose to raise my child with my beliefs and send her to a private school . 	1
WD	34024	Ask your daughters what they would prefer . . . Btw , I work at a co-ed school at the moment and the kids there get on just fine . 	0

WD	34027	Girls do calming exercises ; boys run . 	0
WD	34028	It has a way of sharpening the mind . 	0
WD	34029	That ‚Äô s likely to be good for all of us , regardless of gender . 	0
WD	34030	Hearing yourself say some of this gobbledygook aloud to your kids , though ? 	0
WD	34031	It is closer to the ' real world ' that way . 	0
WD	34032	I went to an all boys school ‚Äì Can ' t say I particularly liked it , I would of much preferred gone to a co-ed . 	1
WD	34033	They will be more at ease around the opposite sex when they are older and it just makes sense . 	0
WD	34034	Kids should grow up in the company of both sexes . . . 	0
WD	34035	We were the worst in 12 years and were beaten by LOTS of co-ed and public schools . . . 	0
WD	34036	If it is purely education you are concerned about ( and not so much behaviour ) , our year ( at a private school ) went shockingly bad in OP scores . 	0

WD	34038	So you can never tell . 	0

WD	34044	"Some view much of what as taught as "" secularism . "" "	0
WD	34045	But none of this is praying to Darwin , or claiming him , or anything , a deity . 	0
WD	34046	This is a sticky subject . 	0
WD	34047	Some think of evolution as teaching atheism . 	0
WD	34048	If they wish to raise their children as atheists , that is their right no matter what anyone thinks . 	0
WD	34049	So therefore they must put up with the school forcing a faith , no matter how shallow , on them ? 	0
WD	34050	Please look forif you ' re interested . 	0
WD	34051	A good question here is how much does this cut into a parent ' s right to raise their children . 	0
WD	34052	Wow . 	0
WD	34053	This brings up a related topic about children ' s rights . 	0
WD	34054	There are serious problems in our public schools . 	0
WD	34055	Morals can only be built on the basis that a moral source-God-exists . 	0
WD	34056	Once acknowledgement of God ' s existence is removed , there is no absolute basis for morals , and a free society drifts toward anarchy . 	0
WD	34057	Young Mr . Powell is another tragic example of the fallacy of Home Schooling . 	0
WD	34058	Then its badness is just something you deplore in the abstract . 	0
WD	34059	Since prayer was removed from public school classrooms in 1962 , we have had a six-fold increase in violent crime , our divorce rate has tripled , births to single mothers have increased five-fold , the teenage suicide rate has tripled , and SAT scores ( standardized college entrance test ) have dropped 80 points ( approximately 10% ) . 	0
WD	34060	No matter how well intentioned , few parents have the education , time , and skills needed to teach . 	0
WD	34061	Parents have all the years before the kids start school in which to indoctrinate litt 	0
WD	34062	When your public school system ranks #50 in the nation you tell me , would you rather send your child to public school or honor them with attending a private school ? 	0
WD	34063	Those who find the schools beneath their ideal learning experience should join everyone in an effort to renew our schools , demanding better performance and . 	0
WD	34064	outcome and be willing to support the much needed funding . 	0
WD	34065	Independent schools have much greater freedom to follow other educational philosophies and practices - Montessori , Steiner , small alternative schools and Summerhill being particularly noteworthy . 	0
WD	34066	But the belief that the schools and teachers must meet their Christian education agenda ends any discussion . 	0
WD	34067	I feel my education was a perfect balance . 	0
WD	34068	The whole issue is just another example of a populace that has fallen into a big ditch , dug by those who despise authority ( Nobody tells me what to do ) , see plots and loss of freedom in every shadow , behind every bush , and in anything that will require them to think before they vote . 	0
WD	34069	Befuddled wishful thinking rules . 	0

WD	34078	They also have wide latitude in deciding which students to admit and which to push out . 	0
WD	34079	The national average of public schools is pulled down by the number of such schools serving poor students . 	0
WD	34080	If these schools were eliminated , schools in the affluent suburbs would hold their own against the best private schools . 	0
WD	34081	But achievement is higher because students in private schools come from more affluent families than students in public schools , rather than because of better practices . 	0
WD	34082	This distinction is crucial . 	0
WD	34083	Using data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Sarah and Christopher Lubienski , professors at the University of Illinois , found that when controlling for demographic factors , public schools are doing a better job academically than private schools . 	0
WD	34084	The parents can talk to their kids about evolution and explain that they do not believe that evolution ever happened ; they can try to push the creation theory and see where they end up . 	0

WD	34090	I learned nothing that I did not know before other than a handful of French verbs which have so far been of as much use as a chocolate fireguard . 	0
WD	34091	I feel strongly that I had a very good education , but my husband said his was lacking . 	0
WD	34092	Neither of us knows much about private education from personal experience , however both of us have met privately-schooled people at university and through work . 	0
WD	34093	These people have spoken about opportunities , like sport and music programs , that had not been available to us as public students , and the extra resources available at the private schools because there was more money available . 	0
WD	34094	The media is full of reports on the lack of funding for public education , and the number of teachers compared with students in the public system means classes are bigger than we ‚Äô d like . 	0
WD	34095	But for a complete , general education do private schools offer the range of subjects , experiences and environment public schools do ? 	0
WD	34096	From my school experience , public schools offered more diversity socially , spiritually and ethnically , so I think it provided a more realistic view of the world I would face after school . 	0
WD	34097	If officials at your school have questions about the event , share our letter with them . 	0
WD	34098	To help these students , we have prepared a letter explaining students ‚Äô well-established legal right to engage in prayer and worship at See You at the Pole and to promote the event at school . 	0
WD	34099	An impotent prayer is no threat to anyone . 	0
WD	34100	If you honestly think your kids will be permanently damaged by learning about evolution , get a grip . 	0

WD	34102	I am not one who needs others to make the choices I made to feel better about myself . 	0
WD	34103	And it ‚Äô s not even the superior academics . 	0
WD	34104	Full disclosure : my wife and I homeschooled our four children through eighth grade , and then used a mixture of private Christian high school and additional homeschooling throughout their high school years . 	0
WD	34105	But that ‚Äô s not what drives this for me . 	0
WD	34106	And want one more fact that may surprise you ? 	0
WD	34107	Homeschooled children do not lag behind public school children overall in communication and socialization skills . 	0
WD	34108	Homeschooled children ‚Äô s tests scores were not significantly affected by their parents ‚Äô household incomes or whether their parents were certified teachers . 	0
WD	34109	Homeschooled children perform better overall in college ‚Äî from their freshman years to their senior years . 	0
WD	34110	So why am I such an advocate ? 	0
WD	34111	Because homeschooling is what lets you guard and protect your child ‚Äô s heart and optimally mold their character in a dark and fallen world . 	0
WD	34112	Trust me , I know . 	0
WD	34113	First hand . 	0
WD	34114	Learn what ? 	0
WD	34115	The BS they half-arsedly try to teach us ? 	0
WD	34116	Isherwood Yes , that ' s true , but the purpose is to give students time to collect thoughts , pray , do homework for the class at hand , etc . Sorry , I can ' t quote the source , but I read some statistics the other day that students who make time each day for some silence ( not necessarily religiously related silence and / or prayer , just silence ) do much better in school because people don ' t realize how much noise dominates our days and inhibits our thought . 	0
WD	34117	I don ' t think 2 minutes of silence could possibly hinder our absolutely terrible public education any further than it ' s current decrepit state . 	0
WD	34118	It ' s all good . 	0
WD	34119	Don ' t worry , I agree . 	0
WD	34120	They are still usually better than parents who have other things to do and who ignore the daily chore of teaching their kids schoolwork . 	0
WD	34121	I attended private school up until age 14 , and I have yet to learn anything from our public ed . system . 	0
WD	34122	True , but the scenario at the top was obviously over-the-top wrong . 	0
WD	34123	His father , Clarence Powell , defends the home-school education that Josh and his 11 siblings have received , and that he has a right to educate his children any way he sees fit without the government interfering . 	0
WD	34124	He eventually took remedial classes at a community college and has since transferred to Georgetown University , but he still has a long way to go in catching up on the years of missed education . 	0
WD	34125	When they declined , he petitioned the school system to let him in , but they declined too . 	0
WD	34126	Powell himself realized how far behind he was falling and had asked his parents to send him to school . 	0
WD	34127	One of his siblings , currently at middle school age , still hasn ' t learned to read . 	0
WD	34128	Powell tells of how his parents , who kept him and his 11 younger siblings out of public schools for religious reasons , failed to provide a basic education that left him far behind other children his age in areas like math , science , history , and English . 	0
WD	34129	The article profiles 21-year-old Josh Powell , the product of home schooling in rural Virginia , who paints an incredibly negative picture of the experience of getting your education at home . 	0
WD	34130	Why do some parents not think their kids can attain ? 	0
WD	34131	No student should be *ASSIGNED* to a single-sex school against his / her will , but I ' m all in favor of voluntary selection into one . 	0
WD	34132	I would much prefer my children attend single-sex high schools to cut down on the distraction factor . 	1
WD	34133	The Powells , of course , are just on case of a home-schooling family , but Josh thinks they are other kids like him . 	0
WD	34134	"The example one of them gave was , "" My neighbor held back her child , and now she ' s in first grade , and reading at a 4th grade level ! "" "	0
WD	34135	Not only that , but far from the crisis in public education that many see , the Lubienskis make a strong case that public school are doing a fine job educating the youth of America . 	0
WD	34136	The results of the study don ‚Äô t surprise me because I live in the real world , and in the real world the best get paid the most . 	0
WD	34137	According to Atlantic , the Lubienskis report that the Educational Testing Service , Stanford and Notre Dame all took a look at the same statistics ‚Äî datasets they call it ‚Äî and came to the same conclusions . 	0
WD	34138	The Lubienskis aren ‚Äô t saying that public school students score higher , because test comparisons show that the average private school student scores higher . 	0
WD	34139	But the private school student is likely to be wealthier , come from a stable family , not have a disability and not have suffered early life trauma . 	0
WD	34140	Correct for these factors ‚Äî in a sense only compare apples that fell from the private school tree with those that fell from the public school tree ‚Äî and the public school wins hands down . 	0
WD	34141	It doesn ‚Äô t surprise me that somebody figured out how to prove that public schools outperform private schools . 	1
WD	34142	And it doesn ‚Äô t surprise me that this seminal study is being ignored by the mainstream news media . 	0
WD	34143	As of one day after Atlantic released its article reviewing The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools , a Google search yielded but one article covering the important findings of authors Sarah Theule Lubienski and Christopher A Lubienski . 	0
WD	34144	The Lubienskis took into the account the effects of affluence , disabilities and other background factors and found that then public schools outperformed private schools over the past twenty years . 	0
WD	34145	I don ' t think age really dictates how well you will do in school or in sports . 	0
WD	34146	The only reason most private schools show good numbers is because they can completely ignore all the problem students . 	0
WD	34147	Around here , there are plenty of choices , but the government only pays for public education of various types and those who can afford private schools pay for those above and beyond their property taxes that fund the public schools . 	0
WD	34148	I don ' t see the big deal . 	1
WD	34149	I do what is best for my children and assume other parents do what is best for their children . 	0
WD	34150	Interestingly , it wasn ' t the atheist Madalyn Murray O ' Hair who sued the school district to stop this , it was some Jewish parents , who thought that the prayers said in school would not be considered appropriate for Jewish students to pray . 	0
WD	34151	Let us hope they do not break the broad global consensus on education reform by pursuing ideological distractions that threaten to undermine the right to education . 	0
WD	34152	For many years the DFID has been a global leader in supporting sector-wide public education reform through the Global Partnership for Education . 	0
WD	34153	Lost revenues from tax exemptions given away unnecessarily by governments add up to $138 billion annually- which is more than enough to ensure we deliver on the full education and wider development agenda in every country . 	0
WD	34154	We need to support progressive macro-economic policies over austerity and we urgently need to expand the domestic tax base of low income countries , for example by ending the unnecessary and often corrupt tax holidays given to big multinational companies . 	0
WD	34155	We need to mobilise new resourcing for education , securing at least 6% of GDP and 20% of national budgets . 	0
WD	34156	We desperately need to improve the quality of public schools , and this issue needs concerted attention and support . 	0
WD	34157	Thankfully , most DFID funding for education is still spent on such efforts . 	0
WD	34158	Such investments yield systemic , nation-wide returns in improving quality ‚Äì a much more strategic and effective use of public money . 	0
WD	34159	Ideological reasons for homeschooling are , in my opinion , completely legitimate . 	0
WD	34160	The public education system has not failed , it ' s got to deal with things that no private school does . 	0
WD	34161	Most private schools are nothing more than religious indoctrination , what difference does it make ? 	0
WD	34162	If you put the same restrictions on the private schools , they ' d be just as bad . 	0
WD	34163	America has experienced radical decline in each of the four areas which the children ‚Äô s prayer touched upon : youth , family , education , national life . 	0
WD	34164	The New York school children which prompted the Engel vs . Vitale ruling had simply prayed : ‚Äú Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence on Thee and beg Thy blessing over us , our parents , our teachers and our nation . ‚Äù 	0
WD	34165	The removal of prayer from our schools was a violation of the third commandment which commands us ‚Äú not to take the name of the Lord in vain . ‚Äù 	0
WD	34166	Minor recovery has occurred only since 1980 when the election of President Reagan brought forth a renewed emphasis on ‚Äú traditional ‚Äù values . 	0
WD	34167	Consider the following chart compiled from his study , America : To Pray or Not to Pray . 	0
WD	34168	A recent statistical analysis by David Barton graphically illustrates how America has plummeted from righteous living , prosperity and success in the last quarter century . 	0
WD	34169	On June 25 , l962 , 39 million students were forbidden to do what they and their predecessors had been doing since the founding of our nation ‚Äì publicly calling upon the name of the Lord at the beginning of each school day . 	0
WD	34170	1 As you might have already noticed on Mr . Barton ‚Äô s graph , America ‚Äô s moral decline rapidly accelerated following one event ‚Äì the U . S . Supreme Court ‚Äô s removal of prayer from our nation ‚Äô s schools . 	0
WD	34171	Worse than taking the Lord ‚Äô s sacred name in vain is treating it with contempt , denying it rightful place and stripping it from public use and even from the lips of children . 	0
WD	34172	By the judicial act of forbidding invocation , the Court audaciously elevated a secularized system of education beyond the authority , reach and blessing of God Himself . 	0
WD	34173	Each school district is different . 	0
WD	34174	Each classroom environment is different . 	0
WD	34175	Each child is an individual . 	0
WD	34176	I continue to monetarily support a broken system that I can not even take advantage the so called benefits of because it does not give my child the adequate tools she will need to be successful in life . 	0
WD	34177	That February birthday excuses me from much of this anxiety . 	0
WD	34178	I think the social aspect of co-education outweighs the potential distractions ; at the end of 6 years , you come out with a study score , but once you have that , I think the memories and friendships you got out of those 6 years become much more important , and I can ' t imagine having as good an experience had I gone to an all-girls school . 	0
WD	34179	While a public school classroom is perfect for your 11-year old Johnnie , it might not be right for 9-year old Susie . 	0
WD	34180	While a particular school district worked well for your kids , perhaps moving to a new school district found them to not be so cooperative . 	0
WD	34181	Given the research on the topic , if you have concerns about your child ‚Äô s behavior and that is why you are considering delaying them , this is important information that may signal your child would benefit from behavioral intervention , if not immediately than it is something to keep in mind as they progress through their early years of schooling . 	0
WD	34182	So what is the answer to the question originally asked of me at that cocktail party ? 	0
WD	34183	What will I do for Leo ? 	0
WD	34184	Well , he will be 5 1 / 2 at the time of kindergarten . 	0
WD	34185	Although I am a big fan of examining the data to inform parenting , the results often do not reveal a clear path , and although group level statistics are useful , they do not tell parents what their individual child ‚Äô s trajectory will be . 	0
WD	34186	What is clear , however , is that given redshirting is much less common than originally thought , parents should worry less about how their child ‚Äô s age will compare to peers ( there is no reason to hold them back just so they won ‚Äô t be much younger than most of their peers ) and more about the signals their own children are giving them . 	0
WD	34187	The big areas to consider are : social skills ( ability to initiate and maintain play , sharing , understanding of own and others ‚Äô emotions ) , academic skills ( knowledge of content areas such as letter / number recognition and phonics ) , ability to regulate impulses ( staying on task , following directions ) , and fine motor skills ( fine motor skills have been linked with academic success above and beyond content knowledge and attentional abilities ) . 	0
WD	34188	Interestingly , teachers rate enthusiasm to learn , ability to follow directions , and attention span as the most important factors for kindergarten success , less so than actual academic knowledge ( which parents tend to perceive as most important ) . 	0
WD	34189	Send your kids to school with their kids . 	0
WD	34190	Do something about it . 	0
WD	34191	Use your connections to power and money and innovation to make your local school‚Äîthe one you are now sending your child to‚Äîbetter . 	0

WD	34194	Single sex education has been very good for girls , especially . 	1
WD	34195	Look at the women leaders in this country and you will find that they are products of single sex educational institutions . 	0
WD	34196	That would still be a step beyond even what those who complain about secularism are complaining to God . 	0
WD	34197	It is opposed because it represents the antithesis to the beliefs of those who set policy for much of our public school system . 	0
WD	34198	My kids won ' t go to public schools for a lot of reasons . 	0
WD	34199	I in good conscience could not ask anyone else to through good money after bad as you suggest that we all do . 	0
WD	34200	Values can be promoted , in accordance with the client population ' s choice . 	0
WD	34201	Private schools provide an option for respecting religion and expressing it publicly . 	0
WD	34202	Ms Wong is really the bad person here , because she wishes to impose a secularist establishment which cannot bring itself to keeping boys in the boys ' lavatories or allowing even elective religiously supported ethical education to be presented to students . 	0
WD	34203	We are so integrated in our neighborhoods and businesses that there is no chance that divisiveness might be exacerbated by private schools , especially in the contemporary religious environment . 	0
WD	34204	That secularism was the worst feature of Soviet Communism and we know what it led to . 	0
WD	34205	Prayer is an action which proclaims that life is more than saving the environment or accumulating wealth . 	0
WD	34206	If the textbooks contain any reference to God , there ' s trouble , and if the teachers happen to make any kind of a reference to God , or religion . . or the hereafter . . or what ever may have any religious connotation , the children tell their parents and the parents complain ! ! ! ! 	0
WD	34207	Time was , the school day started with a prayer , and yes , maybe religion classes , but not nowadays . . there would be full scale war . 	0
WD	34208	The movement to single-sex education in the US has been framed as a solution to both girls ‚Äô absence from science , technology , engineering , and math disciplines and the perceived decline in boys ‚Äô overall academic success . 	0
WD	34209	However , the data behind these assertions is shaky at best . 	0
WD	34210	Diane Halpern , Professor of Psychology at Claremont McKenna College and former President of the American Psychological Association , wrote a particularly biting review of the pro single-sex education literature . 	0
WD	34211	Perhaps as a result of the pro single-sex education framing , the US has seen an increased interest in single-sex schooling in the last few decades . 	0
WD	34212	More private single-sex schools have emerged and even many public school districts have begun to experiment with single-sex programs or classrooms . 	0
WD	34213	An important question that arises in consideration of public schooling , though , is if separate schooling is actually fair to all students . 	0
WD	34214	"Where ever the Muslims go , they expect "" special "" treatment . "	0
WD	34215	Ohhhh , here we go again ! ! ! ! 	0

WD	34217	No religion in schools . . . . this is what we ' ve come to . 	1
WD	34218	Too bad , if the Muslim children don ' t come back to classes after their prayers . 	0
WD	34219	If parents want their children to have religion , they are going to have to teach them at home or in their places of worship . 	0
WD	34220	For goodness sake , it ' s just awful . 	0
WD	34221	That ' s their problem , not the school ' s . 	0
WD	34222	To this day , I tend to feel uncomfortable around anyone who doesn ' t fit that criteria ( ironically enough , since I ' m a left-winged , pansexual atheist ) . 	0
WD	34223	No one is being forced to participate in the event , nor is it interfering with class time . 	0
WD	34224	Yes , they socialize with other people - but those people are other white , right-winged , heterosexual Christians . 	0
WD	34225	So what is the threat ? 	0
WD	34226	They just don ' t get it . 	0
WD	34227	They just don ' t understand the world . 	0
WD	34228	And , that starts with a high quality , fair education that focuses on techniques that work and teaches all students as individuals , not as stereotypes . 	0
WD	34229	There were not a lot of choices as far as curriculum and very few parents continued to homeschool through high school . 	0
WD	34230	I don ' t think that home schooling is good for children and I don ' t think that single sex schooling is good for children either . 	1
WD	34231	On September 25th , millions of students across the globe will participate in See You at the Pole by joining together before the beginning of the school day to pray for their friends , families , teachers , school , and nations . 	0
WD	34232	Whatever home schooling does for you intellectually , I can ' t think it can have that great an influence on their ability to fit in with other kids . 	0
WD	34233	Prepared to be proved wrong though . . . . 	0
WD	34234	Interesting . 	0
WD	34235	I commend your commitment and I wish you all the best for your sons . 	0
WD	34236	I suspect you will probably do a better job of educating them than most schools would . 	0
WD	34237	I can ' t help wondering , though , what the fallout is likely to be in terms of their ability to socialise with other kids . 	0
WD	34238	What bothers me here is that this appears to have been a group decision . 	0
WD	34239	None of us are perfect . 	0
WD	34240	That said , should the decision have been made by one person I would understand and cut that person some slack . 	0
WD	34241	There are many intricate details when making decisions in regards to drawing the line when separation is required . 	0
WD	34242	But such reasoning is deeply flawed and fallacious on multiple levels . 	0
WD	34243	Firstly , we have not ‚Äú kicked God out of our schools . ‚Äù 	0
WD	34244	Students can ( and do ) . 	0
WD	34245	In the wake of violent school-related tragedies , such as the recent massacre at a Newtown , Connecticut public elementary school , there is often a wave of heated rhetoric emanating from religious conservatives regarding how perhaps such school shootings might not have occurred if only we had not ‚Äú kicked God out of our schools ‚Äù by banning state-led school prayer . 	0
WD	34246	So , schools are by no means ‚Äú prayer free zones ‚Äù ‚Äî the shrill objections of ultra-conservative Christians committed to the unconstitutional re-introduction of state-sanctioned , teacher-led daily school prayer notwithstanding . 	0
WD	34247	Just because school officials may not lead students in prayers does not mean that students are unable to freely pray on their own , throughout the day , at school . 	0
WD	34248	While acting in their capacity as employees of the state , public school teachers must comply by the constitutional rules that prevent the state from endorsing or promoting religion . 	0
WD	34249	( That also means that public school teachers may not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms , or teach creationism in science classes , since doing so amounts to just as much of an unconstitutional state endorsement or promotion of religion as does leading students in classroom prayers . ) 	0
WD	34250	That was a hard call because he was pretty shy until high school . 	0
WD	34251	These techniques can vary from room temperature to instruction approaches . 	0
WD	34252	Some educators also suggest that single-sex education can broaden the educational prospects for both the sexes . 	0
WD	34253	When putting these theories into practice , however , experts have asserted that separating students has consequences that extend far beyond the act of learning . 	0
WD	34254	Social , political , and legal concerns come into play when dealing with instituting these policies in public schools . 	0
WD	34255	Proponents of same-sex education argue that a mixed-gender classroom can be distracting for many students , especially at certain ages . 	0
WD	34256	Leonard Sax , founder of the National Association for Single-Sex Public Education , argues that while merely placing boys in separate classrooms from girls accomplishes little , single-sex education enhances student success when teachers use techniques geared toward the gender of their students . 	0
WD	34257	Single-sex education ( teaching males and females in separate classrooms or schools ) is an old approach to instruction that has been gaining new momentum in the education reform era . 	0
WD	34258	Although the practice has long existed in many private schools , it ' s a relatively new option for traditional public schools and charter schools . 	0
WD	34259	Now that over 500 public schools offer some form of single-sex education , experts are renewing the debate over the value of separating boys and girls in the classroom . 	0
WD	34260	According to recent research on the differences between males and females , there are natural differences in how boys and girls approach learning . 	0
WD	34261	I can learn things for myself w / little effort . 	0
WD	34262	But I cannot teach someone else on an educational level , especially since the techniques have changed so much from the way I learned . 	0
WD	34263	My boys have needed help w / their homework at times , and I am honestly dumbfounded at the processes that are used today . 	0
WD	34264	Aside from the fact that I just could not ensure they would get the proper education they deserve for themselves , the only other con that I can see w / homeschooling though is the socialization skills . 	0
WD	34265	I have to say that I admire anyone who has the patience for homeschooling . 	0
WD	34266	I know that I could never do it and make sure that my boys got a good enough education . 	0
WD	34267	"Because I ' m a much better "" learner "" than I am a "" teacher "" and admittingly I just don ' t have the patience that it requires . "	0
WD	34268	I can teach life skills w / no problem . 	0
WD	34269	I know there are other ways around it , but to me , the best way for kids to learn how to interact w / their own peers is by having the opportunity to learn in an environment that isn ' t necessarily always something interest-based like sports , clubs , playgrounds , etc . but that ' s just me . 	0
WD	34270	I know exactly what is spent per student , the check I just wrote . 	0
WD	34271	They removed me from school because school / teachers were teaching me nothing other than ‚Äò you are thick so why bother teaching you ‚Äô . 	0
WD	34272	My second son , whom graduated from MIT , received a ‚Äú Mathematics and Verbal Talent Search Award from The John Hopkins University in 1995 ; when we attended the ceremony we observed that most of the recipients of the awards were home-schooling students and had foreign last names . 	0
WD	34273	No everybody can teach and learn at home , and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools , and the big problem is that nobody could catch them because the most important thing for many parents in this country is that their children should have as many ‚Äú As ‚Äù as possible on their resu 	0
WD	34274	From the students I taught that were home-schooling , only one was exceptional brilliant , he got a very high score in the SAT , and he attended the University of Maryland , College Park to study engineering . 	0
WD	34275	Also , I know that I could have home-schooling my children , because I have a very high level of education , but I would not have the patient to do that , and I believe my sons were benefited with a very good education from a very good public high school with excellent teachers in Worcester County in Maryland ; my oldest son is a biologist ( Salisbury University ) with three masters , my second son is a mathematician ( MIT ) , and my third son is a mechanical engineer ( College Park ) . 	0
WD	34276	It isn ‚Äô t the same the influence that a student mind has from several teachers and their way of thinking than from only one parent way of teaching . 	0
WD	34277	My three sons graduated from a very good high school in Worcester County in Maryland , and the three of them attended excellent universities . 	0

WD	34284	Our liberal , anti-Christian government and the small minority of whining atheists have cleansed our public schools of any positive values and moral teaching . 	0
WD	34285	Revisionist historians have changed the textbooks to honor the immoral and eliminate reference to godly individuals and the good contributions that religion and churches have made to our society . 	0

WD	34287	"And this author thinks we are "" bad people "" for shielding our children from this garbage and creating well-balanced , healthy minded adults who contribute greatly to help our communities ? "	0
WD	34288	The advantage of private school is simple , my money pays for my daughter to be surrounded by like-minded teachers and parents who all want the same thing for their children , a top notch education . 	0
WD	34289	The teachers and administrators are all held accountable and not beholden to a system that is more concerned with keeping people employed , per student spending and providing free breakfast and lunch . 	0

WD	34297	Actually , I don ‚Äô t remember any teacher I worked with ever saying a negative word about homeschooling . 	0
WD	34298	If you show respect to the teachers , they just might return the favor . 	0
WD	34299	I was rather offended at the teacher bashing . 	0
WD	34300	In a class of 25 this takes some time , but I believe it is a good thing for students to hear the various perspectives and express their views among their peers . 	0

WD	34325	It ' s not that I was taught that it was wrong , it was never a topic that was brought up . 	0
WD	34326	Lately I ' ve been thinking more seriously about my single-sex education after devouring Sheryl Sandberg ' s now infamous Lean In . 	0
WD	34327	One of Sandberg ' s bigger points is that a lot of work needs to be done long before women are in careers , graduate school , or even college , in order to teach them how to lean in . 	0
WD	34328	When people find out I ' m the product of eight years of all-girls ' schooling they often ask what the best part of the experience was . 	0
WD	34329	"I usually answer , only half-joking , "" I rarely had to shave my legs . "" "	0
WD	34330	In Lean In Sandberg explains that as a child she used to organize all the neighborhood children and tell them what to do . 	0
WD	34331	"But to this day she cringes when her siblings tell this story because : "" When a girl tries to lead , she is often labeled bossy . "	0
WD	34332	Given this focus on childhood and adolescence I ' m surprised that all-girls ' schools haven ' t been discussed in the same breath as Sandberg ' s long-term project . 	0
WD	34333	"Boys are seldom called bossy because a boy taking the role of a boss does not surprise or offend . "" "	0
WD	34334	My professional , adult self certainly understands this sentiment , but my 13-year-old self would have been confused . 	0
WD	34335	But it turns out , she ‚Äô s not the only one with this problem , and , in fact , given the rapid increase in single-sex programs in public schools , it looks like the trouble may only be spreading . 	0
WD	34336	Take a look at the recently-released November 2010 Arkansas Department of Education ‚Äô s Application for School Improvement Grants . 	0
WD	34337	It explains that Jacksonville High School ( JHS ) initiated The Freshman Academy ‚Äú to help incoming freshmen who needed extra help with academics and social / emotional needs , ‚Äù a laudable goal . 	0
WD	34338	Oh come on . 	0
WD	34339	As a visiting student at Barnard College years ago , I attended the transfer students ‚Äô orientation where each student was asked to explain why she had chosen Barnard . 	0
WD	34340	I ‚Äô ll never forget one woman ‚Äô s response : Well , I went to an all-girls elementary school and an all-girls middle school and an all-girls high school , and when I got to my co-ed college , I didn ‚Äô t know how to function around the boys , so I decided to transfer to Barnard . 	0
WD	34341	Well , that ‚Äô s one solution . 	0
WD	34342	I think I laughed at the time . 	0
WD	34343	Instead of using the program to meet its designated goals , JHS leadership used ‚Äú the Academy as a dual gender reassimilation because the students were coming from gender-based feeder schools . 	0
WD	34344	The Academy became a chance for the students to get back together after being separated in the Jacksonville Boys Middle School and the Jacksonville Girls Middle School . ‚Äù 	0
WD	34345	These same children go to school where they could be introduced to bullying and drugs , and have their education ruined by undisciplined , uncontrolable , disruptive classmates . 	0
WD	34346	But here ‚Äô s the thing : sending my child to a private school does not exempt me from paying city and state taxes that help fund public schools , nor would I want it to . 	0
WD	34347	In an ideal world , I would be in full support of such ideas but in reality , this issue is far more complex ; embracing children with different requirements and potentials . 	0
WD	34348	I ' m not having third grade kids profile my daughter because she ' s not Mexican . 	0
WD	34349	Here is the response that most stuck with me : ‚Äú In our upper-middle-class world , it is hard not to pay for something if you can and you think it will be good for your kid . ‚Äù 	0

WD	34353	We teach our children how to learn , not merely how to pass tests . 	0
WD	34354	My 8yr-old is already enjoying our sessions with basic physics and chemistry textbooks , books which are generally used at the start of secondary school . 	0
WD	34355	@oommph - here you get to a sensitive subject - modern science contains hardly any proper science , just compare the exam papers from the past decade with those from the 70s and 80s . 	0
WD	34356	You ' re also making the mistake of directly comparing discrete subjects from school with a more broad-based approach used by home educators . 	0
WD	34357	We ' ve even done addition and subtraction exercises on a flight home from a holiday before now , and in a Parliamentary committee room one evening , so you can see we ' re all quite flexible about learning . 	0
WD	34358	Forcing prayer upon them is tantamount to removing their ability to decide for themselves whether they would like to be an atheist or not . 	0
WD	34359	He ' s interested now , so we cover the subject now and he ' ll learn it much quicker because of that interest . 	0
WD	34360	Also consider that school is about 25% efficient , so of the five hours a day of nominal lesson time , you lose a fair bit in disruptions , admin , not understanding ( or not listening to ) the topic and having it explained again , finishing the exercise and waiting while it ' s explained again to someone else , etc . Home education doesn ' t take long holidays like school does , so if you work it out , the 250 useful hours of learning at school during a year is easily matched and exceeded by home educators who are doing low-key , low-pressure teaching all the time . 	0
WD	34361	6 ) Children are impressionable . 	0

WD	34368	In terms of fostering an educational environment which feels secure for the child , it is hard to think how the government could be less helpful . 	0
WD	34369	Even if granted , I would have to go through this process on an annual basis and , at any point the LEA could refuse my application and force my child into school . 	0
WD	34370	Its just in public schools they force acceptance almost to a point where it is encouraged . 	0
WD	34371	My six-year-old daughter is educated by me , at home . 	0
WD	34372	The government may implement these recommendations by including them in the Queen ' s speech on 18 November . 	0
WD	34373	This letter was prompted by my concerns about the Badman report , a review into home-education which was submitted in June and immediately accepted by Balls . 	0
WD	34374	Today , I received a copy of a letter that my local MP sent to the education secretary , Ed Balls . 	0
WD	34375	I would also have to apply to my local authority for approval which may , or may not , be granted . 	0
WD	34376	It would be compulsory for me to register with the local authority and a criminal offence for me not to . 	0
WD	34377	Badman ' s recommendations would change what home education means to us ‚Äì a positive and successful part of our family life ‚Äì into an ongoing battle with the state . 	0
WD	34378	I am not a home-education evangelist and neither do I have any problem with the concept of school , but I do know that home education works for us . 	1
WD	34379	Consequently , the outcome , far from being one of ‚Äò liberation ‚Äô , can actually cement oppression , simply because the bigger picture hasn ‚Äô t been considered . 	0
WD	34380	NO ! 	0
WD	34381	From my own experience , I can vouch for the truth of the previous statement . 	0
WD	34382	"Many sociologists agree that females are , "" unable to perform if they are not at least 50% of a class , they feel pressured by stereotype threat and the potential for gender bias , and so a 100% same-sex class would seem to unlock the potential for all females "" ( Campbell 7 ) . "	0
WD	34383	And so , one can argue that a single-sex education can more accurately focus the learning needs of the targeted sex ; but does that secluded sex suffer from the lack of the opposite ? 	0
WD	34384	We must first come to realize that while males and females are not two different species , that are very different when it comes to learning , expression , and overall being . 	0
WD	34385	So , will a single-sex education make you smarter ? 	0
WD	34386	Nonetheless , it has been an on-going , contentious issue for society as to whether a single-sex or co-ed environment provides a superior education . 	0
WD	34387	Contrary to popular belief , the 500 girls that went to my school were not closeted-bible-loving-anti-social-feminists and we did , in fact , socialize with members of the opposite sex . 	0
WD	34388	I spent the last four years of my life in a private , catholic , all girls college preparatory high school and while one may say that I missed out on the standard , social facets of a typical high school experience ; I would argue till death that my all girls high school experience was something I wouldn ' t trade for the world . 	1
WD	34389	I , myself , felt more open and confident to participate in an all girls setting . 	0
WD	34390	I had classmates in high school that flourished in an all-girls setting , by allowing themselves to say and do things they wouldn ' t have done in the company of boys . 	0
WD	34391	Seems a tad delusional to me . 	0
WD	34392	For us , we are having the opposite issue -- we are sending our 4 YO twins to kindergarten early because they are academically , socially and physically ready . 	0
WD	34393	They miss the cut off by three months here , so it ' s been an issue finding a placement for them . 	0
WD	34394	So all this redshirting means that they are likely to have kids who are 2 years older then them in the same class as them by first grade . 	0
WD	34395	"But I don ' t bring it up and it ' s "" yeah , us too , so how is your dd liking her new music teacher ? "" "	0
WD	34396	So this mom is just annoying as Hell - heck , I don ' t think she realizes my kid is too . 	0
WD	34397	I swear if I hear one more time ( and I know I will ) about how advanced her kid is . . . 	0
WD	34398	Everyone . 	0
WD	34399	Each family is unique . 	0
WD	34400	I knew a few kids that it happened to . 	0
WD	34401	The latter point is crucial , as parents who opt to pay have prioritised education in their households and will provide a more supportive home environment ‚Äì which is a key determinant of educational success . 	0
WD	34402	Even if there was some marginal evidence of an increase in gain of quality , it is questionable as to whether or not this could be retained on a larger scale . 	0
WD	34403	Furthermore , and there is no evidence to suggest that the ‚Äú competition effect ‚Äù of low-cost private schools helps to aid in the process of put increasing pressure for improvements in the quality of public schools ( in fact , private schools do the opposite , draining and pauperising the public sector ) . 	0
WD	34404	The narrative surrounding the causality of any ( flawed ) claims of difference in learning outcomes tends to relate to teacher attendance and school accountability . 	0
WD	34405	Even private schools that charge the lowest fees will not help extend access to the 57 million children not in school today . 	0
WD	34406	Proponents of low-cost , private schools argue that privatised schools offer a model of higher educational quality ; but it is here that the evidence is highly contested and inconclusive . 	0
WD	34407	Proponents tend to be highly selective in quoting what is often flawed , and superficial research about improved learning outcomes . 	0
WD	34408	The biggest flaw is that most comparative studies fail to control for the socio-economic status of children as well as the self-evident motivation of parents . 	0
WD	34409	I believe in discipline , accountability , and excellence . 	0
WD	34410	After all , I have a Master of Arts in Teaching , I did my time doing internships and student teaching , and I am experienced at teaching in the classroom . 	0
WD	34411	The proponents of privatised education argue that private schools make a difference by ensuring that teachers are in the classroom and that schools are accountable to parents . 	0
WD	34412	If so , the coherent response should be to invest in teachers within the public system : expanding and improving training and support , making school inspectorates work effectively and strengthening school management committees . 	0
WD	34413	These things are not attainable in public schools because the poor teachers and administrators are worried about getting sued by the parents for everything . 	0
WD	34414	It would only be fair , that if we were to bring Christian Protestant prayer back into the schools that we also allow for Catholic prayer , Muslim prayer and yes , even Satanic prayer to have their place within the school system . 	0
WD	34415	At best , it will create a lot of grumpy students who are forced to say something that they don ‚Äô t believe teaching them hypocrisy and that religion is just something you say . 	0
WD	34416	Why would a public school , a school that isn ‚Äô t designated as a specific Christian school , bring back Christian prayer into the schools ? 	0
WD	34417	It made me cringe to know that us Christians were depending on government , school boards and people who don ‚Äô t subscribe to their faith to bring back prayer into the schools . 	0
WD	34418	While I am a Christian , and I follow Jesus , I don ‚Äô t believe that bringing ‚Äò prayer back into the schools ‚Äô will do anything of value to our school system , our students or our city . 	1
WD	34419	Why would we even expect them too or be disappointed if / when they frown upon it ? 	0

WD	34423	If you think I should say something I ‚Äô m not or take out something I shouldn ‚Äô t say or any other comments . 	0
WD	34424	This may be because the children who parents initially thought were immature and in need of an additional year , where actually exhibiting early symptoms of a larger problem and could have benefited from early intervention . 	0

WD	34431	This number is lowest among low income African American children ( 1% ) , presumably because of the cost to the family to provide another year of childcare , and highest within communities with a mean household income of $100 , 000 or greater ( 7% ) . 	0
WD	34432	Only about 4-5% of kids start kindergarten a year after their birth date allows . 	0
WD	34433	There is no hope there but why should we wait until something is done . 	0
WD	34434	The problem is that Democrat / socialists run most public schools and continue that in higher education which is also failing our children . 	0

WD	34532	Children should be placed in the appropriate grade based on the district guidelines unless there is a documented need to do otherwise . 	1
WD	34533	Personally my move to mainstream education was the best choice as I never really struggled academically ( my disability manifests itself more often on an interpersonal level ) , although this would never have worked for me if I hadn ‚Äô t had provision for my disability , such as a learning support assistant ( LSA ) to help me remain focused . 	1

WD	34551	Though the state must respect a parent ' s right to offer an education consistent with their religious beliefs , sometimes maybe a parent needs to respect the expertise of others when it comes to determining what makes a quality education . 	0

WD	34567	To believe ‚Äò one size first all ‚Äô is clearly coming from people who have never suffered from learning difficulties themselves , from bullying , from the physically ‚Äò sick with dread ‚Äô feeling one gets on the Sunday knowing that tomorrow is a school day . 	0
WD	34568	I am one of 4 children , my sister thrived in mainstream school , so my parents let her stay there , my two brothers went to a different school altogether , school for boys with learning difficulties and they thrived in their school . 	0

WD	34571	Since the age of 10 I ‚Äô ve had to put up with people judging something they don ‚Äô t understand , telling my parents that they ‚Äô re wrong for home schooling me ( even though I could not have been happier ) , they never asked me ( the one being home schooled ) how I felt about it , if they did they still wouldn ' t have listened , they ' ve made their mind up and they are sticking with their inexperienced views . 	0

WD	34593	I am democrat and I vote just like everybody else , but I can see the public school system just isn ' t what it used to be and that ' s why I want to send her to private school . 	0
WD	34594	If we could afford it , I would home school and be done with the system all together . 	0
WD	34595	would this happen in a state school ? 	0
WD	34596	I doubt it , as there are not the funds for a full time academic advisor . 	0
WD	34597	He also couldn ' t seem to learn to read . 	0
WD	34598	In the public school , our son was more well-adjusted with better manners and generally happier , but didn ' t receive appropriate levels of OT and ST . 	0
WD	34599	Our contention all along , no matter where he goes to school , is that everyone consider the whole child - not just the academic gains or his emotional well-being but the totality of our son as a person . 	0
WD	34600	Instead , he was given private placement in a non-public school . 	0
WD	34601	At his year end IEP , we pressed for appropriate services in the public school . 	0
WD	34602	Despite all this , he seemed happy enough with his peers in the special education classroom ; he was a bubbly , outgoing , talkative boy . 	0
WD	34603	They weren ' t actively mean to him - they just gave him a wide berth . 	0
WD	34604	He was invited to 1 birthday party of a non-disabled peer ( God bless that little girl and her parents ! ) but no other classmates with disabilities came and the other children stayed away from my son . 	0
WD	34605	A stark difference is the culture of the non-public school versus the public school . 	0

WD	34611	Give me a break ! 	0
WD	34612	"Hello , I constantly hear and read the cliches ( no offense ) , "" I am not ______ , but I don ' t the ______ should do _______ . "" . "	0
WD	34613	It by definition must be NUMERO UNO in all areas of life . 	0
WD	34614	Well , duh , it is this simple : Religion is a structure of beliefs that influence everything you do , think , and say . 	0
WD	34615	Why ? 	0
WD	34616	All or Nothing people , there cannot be middle ground . 	0
WD	34617	In India , for example , low-cost , private schools often pay less than one fifth of a teacher ' s salary . 	0
WD	34618	These low-cost private schools share a common thread in that they extract a profit from the fees received , by either employing teachers who lack training and / or qualifications , or by paying teachers much lower salaries than those earned by teachers in government schools . 	0
WD	34619	UK aid is supposed to be focused on ending extreme poverty and support for low-cost private schools inherently contradicts this ; instead , such schools actually exacerbate inequality . 	0
WD	34620	Typically teachers are given short-term contracts ; they can be hired and fired at the whim of the private provider : this has dangerous systemic effects on the status of teachers and the credibility of the teaching profession . 	0
WD	34621	For parents with four children , living on a dollar a day , paying $8 or more per child per month consumes more than their entire income . 	0
WD	34622	DFID concedes that in India , ‚Äú no schools charging below $8 are able to perform well ‚Äù . 	0
WD	34623	DFID has found that : ‚Äú Evidence does suggest that there are serious equity and choice barriers associated with the growth of low cost private schools ‚Äù , yet , it seems that these concerns are not enough to stop new and further DFID investments . 	0
WD	34624	In such contexts , parents may choose to send just one child to the low-cost school ; and usually boys are prioritised , thereby excluding girls and children with disabilities . 	0
WD	34625	Depriving your child of a basic education is a form of child abuse . 	0
WD	34626	It can ruin your child ' s whole life . 	0
WD	34627	Home schooling should be illegal unless the parent can demonstrate that they are providing the same level of education as a public school . 	1
WD	34628	There should be a core national curriculum and testing to ensure children are achieving at least a basic level of education . 	0
WD	34629	In an increasingly complex , global technological society , all people need to have a basic understanding of science , technology and local and global culture , just to be able to function and make informed decisions . 	0
WD	34630	I don ' t see any need for home schooling any child unless the child has special needs or learning difficulties . 	1
WD	34631	If public schools are under-performing , then the public education system needs to be improved . 	0
WD	34632	Public education in the US seems to be a self-perpetuating disaster , with ignorant , uneducated , unqualified people on school boards deciding what children should learn . 	0
WD	34633	No amount of teachers and staff can keep students from throwing up a prayer before class or a test or before they eat lunch . 	0
WD	34634	As a student , i think schools should definately support prayer in schools . 	1
WD	34635	Children who don ' t want to pray don ' t have to , and those who do can have their concentration to do so . 	0
WD	34636	As far as a moment of silence during homeroom , I say why not ? . 	0
WD	34637	I fully understand nonbelievers or nonreligious people who dont pray , but their moment of silence can be used for relaxation or even sleep if they want . 	0
WD	34638	A moment of silence doesnt require students or teachers to pray ; Prayer isnt even mentioned in the words , so why make a big deal of it ? . 	0
WD	34639	Unfortunately , we have millions of kids and not all families have the resources to homeschool . 	0
WD	34640	In many underresourced schools , it ‚Äô s the aggressive PTAs that raise the money for enrichment programs and willful parents who get in the administration ‚Äô s face when a teacher is falling down on the job . 	0
WD	34641	And parents have a lot of power . 	0
WD	34642	If I have kids , I will probably homeschool them , because I think that homeschooling fosters real interest and excitement in issues , compared to the stressful motivators of grades and standardized testing . 	1
WD	34643	I also went to public school in a wealthy area in San Diego . 	0
WD	34644	"I went to private school in "" the hood "" in Los Angeles . "	0
WD	34645	Why ? 	0
WD	34646	Private school wins , no matter where you go . 	1
WD	34647	Granted , this should be taught at home . 	0
WD	34648	Children are taught , not only the mandatory curriculum , but also how to be considerate , disciplined and respectful . 	0
WD	34649	In the future , should I have children , they will without a doubt be enrolled in private schools , K-12 , just as I was . 	0
WD	34650	But if you know that what your child is being taught at school emphasizes what you ' re teaching them at home and they ' re being supervised at all times , and they ' re getting a good education , how does that not make sense ? 	0
WD	34651	No self control at all . 	0
WD	34652	There is widespread complaint among parents that children are tested too young and too often , teaching them only to pass tests so that civil servants can compile ultimately meaningless statistics . 	0
WD	34653	More and more parents are choosing to home educate because the school system fails their children . 	0
WD	34654	"Under the new regulations though , they would have the legal right to enter my home and interview my child alone in a room to "" check "" for signs of abuse , not because of any good reason to suspect abuse is taking place , but simply because I have chosen to home educate . "	0
WD	34655	The education officers who liaise with home-educators are trained teachers , not social workers , and so are not trained in the highly specialised field of child abuse . 	0
WD	34656	He claims that home education is the perfect cover for child abuse , but provides no evidence to support this claim . 	0
WD	34657	"My greatest concern about Badman , though , is his suggestion throughout the report that being at home rather than with "" professionals "" means that the child is at a "" greater risk of harm "" . "	0
WD	34658	"As with so much legislation that the government has managed to get through parliament under the emotive banner of "" child welfare "" , this proposed legislation peddles the idea that children can only be dealt with by professionals . "	0
WD	34659	This report is a solution without a problem . 	0
WD	34660	No , because what the report implies is that if you send your child to a school , you are less likely to be a child abuser . 	0
WD	34661	"Will education officers also be going into schools and taking each child into a room by themselves to "" check for signs of abuse "" ? "	0
WD	34662	This superintendent was trying every possible way to improve the children ' s education and the union shot it down . 	0

WD	34667	Quite the eye opener . 	0
WD	34668	It ' s not uncommon for public school teachers to send their own kids to private schools . 	0
WD	34669	Most of the homeschoolers I knew growing up were the stereotypical Christian homeschoolers with strict parents who didn ' t do anything secular or know anything about the real world . 	0
WD	34670	In this documentary the superintendent of schools in Washington DC offered to double teachers salaries if they were willing to give up their tenure and get out of the teacher ' s union . 	0
WD	34671	( Teachers get tenure after only 2 years of teaching which makes it virtually impossible to fire them for any reason . ) 	0
WD	34672	They could choose to stay tenured and keep their salary or give it up and double their salary . 	0
WD	34673	The teacher ' s union refused to allow it to be voted on by the teachers . 	0
WD	34674	One solution to the problem of how to set standards for schools that has grown increasingly popular in the U . S . is the use of private schools . 	0
WD	34675	It ‚Äô s essential . 	0
WD	34676	I graduated and went back and got an MBA . 	0
WD	34677	I have my own opinions on this debate . 	0
WD	34678	The debate points have changed little while both homeschool and public school have changed greatly ! 	0
WD	34679	I hold two bachelor degrees , graduated Magna Cum Laude from a public university , and taught in the public school system . 	0
WD	34680	First , may I point out that I am a product of homeschool . 	0
WD	34681	You basically get one opportunity to do it . 	0
WD	34682	I accidentally unleashed a firestorm debate on Facebook by simply asking for homeschool information from my homeschooling friends . 	0
WD	34683	The debate between homeschool and public school has been taking place for longer than I even know . 	0
WD	34684	Instead of receiving said advice , I started a debate of homeschool versus public school and socialization versus the lack thereof . 	0
WD	34685	When I graduated , state law did not yet allow ( or perhaps had just allowed . 	0
WD	34686	I graduated from homeschool in November of 1994 , a semester early . 	0
WD	34687	Most Americans are in favor of prayer in public school because they realize that there is something to be gained from the open acknowledgement of God ' s existence . 	0
WD	34688	Homeschoolers , on the other hand , frequently extend their everyday classroom in real community settings and interactions . 	0
WD	34689	When my kids got old enough for school , I sent them to private school and they were ready for University work . 	0
WD	34690	Some consider public school to be an artificial setting with students being locked behind school gates characterized by forced silence , age-segregation and school bells . 	0
WD	34691	There is pressure for all our pupils today in school ‚Äì in fact far too much and too early . 	0
WD	34692	We have become a very narrow exam based factory where the ‚Äò whole ‚Äô person does not appear to be as important as Maths , English and Verbal Reasoning ! 	0
WD	34693	Everyone needs to be invested in our public schools in order for them to get better . 	0
WD	34694	Ditto , social justice and pastoral care . 	0
WD	34695	I recall two girls at my high school had a parent die . 	0
WD	34696	"We were never formally told , we just swept it under the carpet . . . i still feel gulity for never saying "" so sad for you , how can I help you now that you mum has died . "" "	0
WD	34697	At Private schools , a food roster is started , and kids are told to reach out . . 	0
WD	34698	I know it may see , irrelevant , but people care more . . . for me , this is the perceived advantage of private schooling . 	0
WD	34699	Boys and girls going through their teens together is a far more realistic and healthy arrangement than either single sex girls school or a school where girls join the boys in sixth form . 	0
WD	34700	The teenage years are perhaps the most turbulent we experience and during this period growing up side by side as the norm and mixing with the opposite sex is a powerful and important life skill . 	0
WD	34701	Just learning and knowing how to interact with each other , feeling comfortable , going to parties and just appreciating from a boy ‚Äô s view that girls are not some ‚Äò alien creature ‚Äô not to be talked to are vital factors in helping children to adapt to society as a whole . 	0
WD	34702	Parents who send their children to private schools do support public schools . 	0
WD	34703	So , how would this work exactly ? 	0
WD	34704	I bet you are going to do everything within your power to make it better . 	0
WD	34705	Your local school stinks and you do send your child there ? 	0
WD	34706	It is very costly , but I believe that the two things you can give your children are a good education and lots of love . 	0
WD	34707	The moral law never alters for the noblest or the weakest ; it remains abidingly and eternally the same . ‚Äù 	0
WD	34708	Regardless of how the U . S . Supreme Court has ruled , we must each , as Oswald Chambers declared , realize that ‚Äú God ‚Äô s laws are not watered down to suit anyone ; if God did that He would cease to be God . 	0

WD	34710	If you can I would suggest Private schooling . 	1

WD	34738	But I had to go to my local public school to take the PSAT and someone was getting arrested as we were leaving . 	0
WD	34739	Thanks , Michael Byrd 	0
WD	34740	But I live in a community that could be considered a little rednecked and the extremes are a little more common here . 	0
WD	34741	But , hey , my first year as a full time student in college was at 13 , which I ' m not anyore , but i feel like im behind because all of the General facts about things you learn in regular school , I don ' t know . 	0
WD	34742	I think that the superiority over one type of schooling doesn ' t exist . 	0
WD	34743	It all depends on the person . 	0
WD	34744	I went to public school and was in every club , president of some , and also was in the Student Body Presidency . 	0
WD	34745	Public schooling creates lots of oppurtunities to meet large groups of people . 	0
WD	34746	This was good for me because my type of personality is to lead people , though usually through manipulation bargains and other types of persuasion , not because im a strong leader . 	0
WD	34747	At the same time I signed up for homechooling so that I could launch myself into college . 	0
WD	34748	I ' ve never done regular homeschooling though . 	0

WD	34751	Bottom line : Yet again left wingers hate competition and choice and want to force EVERYONE into their failed system ( see also : Obamacare ) . 	0
WD	34752	I ' ve known people who were HS where their parents didn ' t really teach them all that much . 	0
WD	34753	Public schools are not going to change even if you and every other parent went up there and complained everyday because the unions won ' t allow it . 	0
WD	34754	There are still great teachers in the public schools - lets stand behind them . 	0
WD	34755	That finding will no doubt come as a surprise to those who believe private schools are intrinsically superior . 	0
WD	34756	The simple fact is that these students will do well in any education venue . 	0
WD	34757	Instead of keeping these bright and well-behaved students in the public schools as models to other students , private schools take only the best and claim that their system is better since their student body is so much more elite . 	0
WD	34758	Responsible homeschooling families attempt to have open and honest communication , preparing children to deal with situations as they arise . 	0
WD	34759	In fact , homeschooled children are often confident , adept at communicating their point of view and capable of making wise choices and responsible decisions . 	0
WD	34760	It ‚Äô s innate , a brain thing . 	0
WD	34761	But I ‚Äô m that way , as is his dad and his sister . 	0
WD	34762	Students with special needs might benefit too . 	0
WD	34763	However , the flexibility provided by the homeschool lifestyle may allow students to develop expertise in other areas such as nature , travel and culture , or budgeting and home management . 	0
WD	34764	Homeschoolers might not study the same topics as peers ' neighborhood schools . 	0
WD	34765	Limited Breadth of Curriculum Some proponents of formal education are concerned that homeschooled students will not receive the breadth of curriculum that children receive in school . 	0
WD	34766	This argument simply does not stand , as most homeschooling families do not live in isolation . 	0
WD	34767	Sheltering Children vs . Strengthening Families A final argument that often crops is that homeschooled children are not prepared to deal with real-world situations . 	0
WD	34768	Families are able to decide how broad or how channeled a child ' s curriculum should be . 	0
WD	34769	They may not receive services from school-based special education staff , but they can receive individualized education in the areas most relevant to their needs . 	0
WD	34770	With our eldest son turning four next year , my partner and I have started discussing when he will go to school - and where . 	0
WD	34771	The problem is the public schools are running the schools poorly . 	1
WD	34772	The private school parents pay for Public , schools , as well as childless parents pay . 	0
WD	34773	So I don ' t blame those that spend more to send their kids to private schools , 	0
WD	34774	The unions are their main priorty , not the child ' s education . 	0
WD	34775	Also , if I hear one more person talk about the lack of ‚Äú socialization ‚Äù as a reason not to homeschool , I ‚Äô m going to erupt . 	0
WD	34776	So why would anyone want to take their children out of the dominant public education system of our country and attempt to homeschool them on their own ? 	0
WD	34777	That ‚Äô s easy . 	0
WD	34778	Kids do better academically when homeschooled . 	0
WD	34779	I think everyone who is able should consider homeschooling their child . 	1
WD	34780	However , there are also a number of respected private , or independent , schools within easy driving distance , so this is something else for us to consider when planning for our sons ‚Äô educational needs . 	0
WD	34781	Somebody needs to . 	0
WD	34782	I am sick and tired of reading diatribes against homeschooling from those who have never homeschooled , don ‚Äô t have children , or simply have a bias against the Christian overtones related to homeschooling . 	0
WD	34783	It ' s time to disestablish the Church in this country , as well , and allow children to pick any religion ( or none ) in their own time , without the Government pushing them in any direction . 	1
WD	34784	My husband and I both attended public schools . 	0
WD	34785	We aren ' t interested in whether you like it or not . 	0
WD	34786	So we had to do what was best for our children by finding a school that fit the same values we were trying to instill in our children . 	0
WD	34787	Teachers voted against everything us as parents were trying to accomplish . 	0
WD	34788	Very little changed with all our efforts . 	0
WD	34789	Reality sunk in . 	0
WD	34790	We put all of our effort into making the system better , joined every group , volunteered at the school and all events . 	0
WD	34791	Our family switched back to the charter school after doing exactly what the writer suggested . 	0
WD	34792	I ' ve had my children in parochial school , switched to public and now a charter school . 	0
WD	34793	That says something about our morals or ethics if you will . 	0
WD	34794	Even with aides , a teacher often has to slow down and / or pause the lesson to address certain disruptive behaviors ( saw this in my dcs ' class last year , which had multiple inclusion students , some of whom were non-verbal & had daily tantrums & outbursts ) . 	0
WD	34795	At any rate I do have a point to make . 	0
WD	34796	The fact that it made the news that these two kids were honest is amazing . 	0
WD	34797	The store management even provided them with some sort of reward . 	0
WD	34798	All of this attention and a reward for doing the right thing . 	0
WD	34799	Obviously , I touched a nerve and found out first-hand the extent of the cohesiveness among homeschooling community . 	0
WD	34800	As the elder Powell says , the failure to do so can be incredibly difficult for a child to overcome . 	0
WD	34801	Having those distractions ( not to mention having additonal aides in the room ) can be counterproductive to other students . 	0
WD	34802	People were able to learn social skills long before there were schools . 	0
WD	34803	You don ' t need school for this , since this can be provided by a properly functioning community of friends and relations . 	0
WD	34804	"It provides children with the chance to work and play with their peers and promotes the development of social skills and interacting with people outside of the family . "" "	0
WD	34805	"@ Danot "" There ' s a lot more to be learned at school than the syllabus . "	0
WD	34806	Home schooling , on the other hand , promotes independence , especially independence from the state - which is the reason totalitarians hate home schooling so much , and ban it so happily . 	0
WD	34807	"What schools actually promote , of course , is not "" social skill "" but social conformity , social obedience , and social subservience to an unelected "" authority "" external to the family . "	0
WD	34808	That is the kind of thing that parents are supposed to be teaching their kids not to do . 	0
WD	34809	I highly doubt most bad people as kids are thinking to themselves , ‚Äú You know what , when I grow up I don ‚Äô t want to be a fireman , I want to hurt people ‚Äù . 	0
WD	34810	Maybe just a bad choice or two has led them down a path that they did not intend to be on . 	0
WD	34811	Hell not all bad people are BAD people . 	0
WD	34812	Not all prisoners are bad people . 	0
WD	34813	Not all religious folks are good people . 	0
WD	34814	Now I understand that there is GOOD and BAD in everything . 	0
WD	34815	You know about 60 % of religious people that I have personally met are hypocrites they preach about this and they preach about that and then once they are done putting on there Sunday best they go home drink a fifth and beat their kids . 	0
WD	34816	Last time I checked you were supposed to let God do that kind of work . 	0
WD	34817	Who do you think that you talking to a non-religious person is going to get them to change or believe what you believe . 	0
WD	34818	I ' m sending them there to learn . 	0
WD	34819	Plus , from my own sports experience , age has little to do with sports once you hit the high school level anyway -- I played Varsity Volleyball and Varsity Track as a freshman ( when I was 14 ) . 	0
WD	34820	"She claims it makes a "" huge "" difference for sports . "	0
WD	34821	Personally , I ' m not sending my kids to school to play sports . 	0
WD	34822	"I can certainly understand it if the parents feel the kid isn ' t ready , but what I ' m hearing a lot of in our area is parents ( particularly of boys ) doing it because they feel it will make their kid the "" class leader "" or the "" best "" in sports ( which is ridiculous IMHO ) . "	0
WD	34823	One of the girls I went to high school with went redshirted two of her three boys because of the sports issue alone ( apparently , she didn ' t know she had the option with the first one but would have redshirted his too if she had known ) . 	0
WD	34824	In Chicago , Illinois ( USA ) , the school district instituted a policy that required 6 YOs to be placed in 1st grade if their parents held them back from Kindergarten . 	0
WD	34825	Redshirting has become such an issue there that the school district felt they had no choice . 	0
WD	34826	Most of the team was made up of seniors and juniors ( who were 3 to 4 years older than me ) . 	0
WD	34827	"And really , how can you as a parent feel proud of your child and feel that he is "" better "" at sports than his classmates when his classmates are 2 years younger than him . "	0
WD	34828	I ' m on the same page as FedUp . 	0
WD	34829	classroom teacher , who often is not special ed certified , has his / her resources & abilities stretched to try to accommodate the special needs in their class . 	0
WD	34830	It isn ‚Äô t necessarily better to have kindergarten classes full of 6- and 7-year-olds . 	0
WD	34831	( A good example is Hope Academy in Concord , N . C . ) 	0
WD	34832	If you can ‚Äô t do that , take advantage of the growing number of schools that offer a combination of homeschooling and formalized classroom experience . 	0
WD	34833	But because there are few voices out there promoting for it , let me make mine loud and clear . 	0
WD	34834	It ‚Äô s a difficult thing to advocate for what you feel may be the best for a child without unduly demeaning the good being done in other settings . 	0
WD	34835	Not just for the academics , but for their protection . 	0
WD	34836	If you can homeschool your child through at least the middle school years , do . 	1
WD	34837	And that ‚Äô s what your goal should be : parenting your child ‚Äô s inner world . 	0
WD	34838	But even if there was a conflict ( there isn ‚Äô t ) , sports don ‚Äô t outweigh what ‚Äô s best for your child ‚Äô s heart . 	0
WD	34839	I know so many of you strive to bring Christ to bear on that setting . 	0
WD	34840	Please know how much I respect and value the hard work and clear calling present in the life of countless teachers and administrators in the public school system . 	0
WD	34841	Let us require the parents to insure those children learn the same subjects , as their age peers , in public or private schools . 	0
WD	34842	Let us required the children to take standardized tests . 	0
WD	34843	And if you experience any difficulty promoting or participating in the event , contact us . 	0
WD	34844	The bible says to pray in private . 	0
WD	34845	That , within itself , is a major problem : these children do not receive that personal contactt with other children of their own ages . 	0
WD	34846	The majority of home schooled children I have met , and had contact with , are smart and get along well with adults , but have an awful time relating to other children . 	0
WD	34847	Happily , some parents realize this , and have their children participate in other groups , such as church , Scouting , 4H , etc . to get that additional group support , and friendships amongst their peers . 	0
WD	34848	They simply do not learn to interact with their peers , and thus are constrained by that pressure , the rest of their lives . 	0
WD	34849	The parents , described in this article , are doing their children a disservice by refusisng to not only let them , but require them to have that knowledge , required in todays workplace . 	0
WD	34850	This is an important part of education , and goes along with the actual learning skills and knowledge required of todays citizen , in order to further their education , get a job and advance through life . 	0
WD	34851	This state needs to immediately back off on the present rules , and fix the problem . 	0
WD	34852	They have robbed them of the chance to advance in life , and that is child abuse . 	0
WD	34853	We do have a lot of private schools around us , we are starting to look into the cost , as ODD is now 3 we figured we should start looking into it . 	0
WD	34854	Early formal education , adult-led activities , single age classes , each child across the country pretty much studying the same thing , in the same way at the same time irrespective of ability , interest or other opportunities . 	0
WD	34855	Funny I really could care less if people are offended by these things , but I am quite concerned that God might be . 	0
WD	34856	Private schools do not receive money from the federal or state governments , so they have significantly more freedom in the types of courses to offer , the types of teachers they hire , and the requirements for graduation . 	0
WD	34857	If you can afford private school ( even if affording means scrimping and saving , or taking out loans ) , chances are that your spawn will be perfectly fine at a crappy public school . 	0
WD	34858	Inclusion can be successful & rewarding for all involved but it also has drawbacks . 	0
WD	34859	"It ' s ironic that it is viewed as anti-christian to not want prayer at school and in public venues , to not want "" In God We Trust "" on our money , and to not want "" One nation under God "" in the pledge of allegiance because we really haven ' t earned that claim . "	0
WD	34860	"Cut down on the ( misogynistic ) bigotry in the classroom and society and there won ' t be any perceived "" need "" for single-gender classrooms . "	1
WD	34861	Seriously , our society depends on us interacting with each , at the very least , since we each make up over half the damn species ! 	0
WD	34862	"In light of that fact , there are only two reasons why students are enrolled in private schools : 1 ) It is a matter of prestige in order to instill an image of elitism , or 2 ) people have been intentionally misled into believing that private schools are "" better "" than their public counterparts . "	0
WD	34863	So , my high school diploma is a GED which I passed with flying colors and had my choice of colleges to attend . 	0
WD	34864	There is no partnership between the parents and the teachers and as a result , there is a tendancy for the parents to side ( usually unfairly ) with their kids . 	0
WD	34865	Unless you are actively involved with the ongoing education of your children , helping to shape their character and working with them to develop themselves into positive , constructive members of society , then you will wind up with what we are seeing . 	0
WD	34866	The main problem with public schools is parent participation . 	0
WD	34867	What you see is 10% of the parents being involved and the rest of them expect the school system to take care of their kids . 	0
WD	34868	People do not send their kids so they can associate with rich kids , they send them because they know the expectations are higher and that their kids will have a chance at a better education because of it . 	0
WD	34869	A school system that is struggling , against the odds to somehow , marginally educate our children . 	0
WD	34870	There ' s nothing wrong with private schools . 	1
WD	34871	I know several people who said that they wish their parents had waited a year to send them to kindergarten . 	0
WD	34872	DH was 4 when he started school and was only 17 when he graduated from HS . 	0
WD	34873	He hated that everyone was doing everything a year before he could do it . 	0
WD	34874	He was very good at sports though , even though he was a year younger than anyone else on his team . 	0
WD	34875	I honestly made my decision because I had a choice and I just did not feel right personally about sending my DS to Kindergarten at age 4 . 	0
WD	34876	Last year the cut off was October 9th I believe and this year it has been changed to July 1st . 	0
WD	34877	DS ' s birthday is August 30th . 	0
WD	34878	I did not wait to send DS because I wanted him to have an edge over anyone . 	0
WD	34879	Age has nothing to do with ability and if he were the type who would struggle , he would struggle regardless of when he started school . 	0
WD	34880	I do not compare my children with other people ' s children . 	0
WD	34881	What appears at first glimpse to be good progress might not be , according to psychotherapist Melinda Clayton , who practices in Florida and Colorado . 	0
WD	34882	A study released last August showed that the New York City Department of Education is making good progress toward reforms that will reverse a longstanding practice of segregating special education students in their own classrooms and schools , the New York Times reported . 	0
WD	34883	Ours will be that the State Education system is totally ruined , due to many years of being systematically abused by left-wingers . 	0
WD	34884	I wouldn ' t trust a state school to train a dog , much less raise a child . 	1
WD	34885	Should schools be forcing children to worship anyway ? 	0
WD	34886	I was merely soliciting information from them to add to our decision making process . 	0
WD	34887	For the majority of the children in the school , mainstream would not have been a suitable placement . 	1
WD	34888	Many didn ' t speak at all , had extremely challenging behavior and needed to access the curriculum in a very different way to how they would in a mainstream setting . 	0
WD	34889	As has been mentioned by others it really depends on the child and the resources available . 	0
WD	34890	I am a teacher ( currently SAHM ) and worked in a specialist school for children with severe learning difficulties and ASD . 	0
WD	34891	In some cases , inclusion can work fantastically well . 	1
WD	34892	My school had an inclusion class attached to a local mainstream school . 	0
WD	34893	Their needs can be far better met in a specialist school with specialist teachers and resources . 	0
WD	34894	No offended intended to teachers in mainstream settings-I just think it ' s a lot to ask when they may have a class of 30+ children with completely different needs to consider and limited training in SEN . 	0
WD	34895	The pupils would spend the majority of the time in the inclusion classroom , but spend a few lessons a week in a mainstream class ( with a known teaching assistant ) . 	0
WD	34896	They usually went in for sessions like Art , where the difference in ability is less obvious . 	0
WD	34897	Public school are just as good really , if you find the good ones out of the lot that is - In CT they are recognizable 	1
WD	34898	Every one does not have to pray if you choose not to then that is your choice . 	0
WD	34899	Me being a young teen in school , have witnessed first hand to this and i can truly say that prayer should be allowed in schools . 	1
WD	34900	Not only has it affected the schools it has also affected the homes and the homes and its inhabitants . 	0
WD	34901	I believe that prayer being banned from the public school systems was by far the most uneducated and most of all immoral thing that could have been done . 	1
WD	34902	The United States , a far more religious place than this nation of lost souls , has enshrined that idea in its constitution : the state must not support or endorse any religion , so that people can be free to choose their own without coercion . 	0
WD	34903	But more important than that , imposing a state-sponsored religion is wrong . 	1
WD	34904	Please don ‚Äô t let the ignorance of 10 people ruin a nations well being ! ! ! 	0
WD	34905	Increasingly , girls have been besting boys ‚Äô performance across the board : G . P . A . s , school leadership , graduation rates , college attendance . 	0
WD	34906	No organized prayers or services anywhere on public school board property - FOR ANYONE . 	1
WD	34907	In those cases , children can end up being home-schooled by people who may not have the attitude or aptitude for it . 	0
WD	34908	I went to co-ed schools from kindergarten until the end of 9th grade . 	0
WD	34909	I will have 10 special education students in one class period , and another math teacher with the same class in the same period will have none . 	0
WD	34910	I have ADHD and really struggled with the classroom setting- I had too much energy to stay in my seat , I was making too much noise , I was disturbing the other kids , etc- and because of that I spent virtually all of elementary school on behavior contracts that to this day still fill me with an acute sense of shame . 	0
WD	34911	In middle school , I was severely bullied and isolated . 	0
WD	34912	That led to the development of various mental illnesses in ninth grade , and between that and the ADHD , I couldn ' t handle public school anymore and switched out . 	0
WD	34913	I had some great teachers , I had good grades , and I had a small handful of friends , but ultimately public school did not work for me . 	0
WD	34914	The success of homeschooling depends so much on the student , the parent , and the environment they live in . 	0
WD	34915	I did ten and a half years of public school , and then switched out halfway through ninth grade to homeschool . 	0
WD	34916	I now do online school and I think it works fairly well for me . 	0
WD	34917	Yes , I succeeded in school and was generally an A student , but that was mostly because I ' m naturally intelligent and capable . 	0
WD	34918	Yes , I face social barriers now , but honestly I ' m just as awkward as I was in public school . 	0
WD	34919	I have trouble with self motivation sometimes , and take lots of breaks , but I always get all of my schoolwork done . 	0
WD	34920	And the same goes for any child in any school , as any teacher will tell you . 	0
WD	34921	Frankly , the difference is in the parenting and input , not in the method of education . 	0
WD	34922	Homeschooling is not something I have a problem with . 	1
WD	34923	Same with the daughter . 	0
WD	34924	If he likes it , he ' ll stay , if he doesn ' t like it , he ' ll stay and i ' ll work with the school to sort the problems , if he still doesn ' t get on , i ' ll homeschool . 	0
WD	34925	As a secondary teacher who is currently a SAHM with two kids under 4 , I ' ve applied for my sons ' primary place next year . 	0
WD	34926	60 % of them were homeschooled badly , were not up to speed , had evidently not done much mixing , and the kids themselves struggled to fit in at all for the first few years and did not do as well academically . 	0
WD	34927	They went on to do very well . 	0
WD	34928	40% of them were fantastic and had obviously had superb parenting and a grounded education with lots of input from a variety of educators and people . 	0
WD	34929	However , I have taughth some children who have been homeschooled up to Secondary level . 	0
WD	34930	St . Clair high school would once again have both good and bad consequences because boys would most likely do better because of the presence of girls , but girls would most likely do worse . 	0
WD	34931	If De La Salle had teachers capable of punishing students and keeping the boys on track while in school , then it would most likely be a benefit , if the staff lacks the ability to control the boys , it would be bad . 	0
WD	34932	It breaks my heart when I hear about other teachers ridiculing these students in class or dismissing their needs . 	0
WD	34933	I do know one family over-sheltered homeschoolers who fit the stereotypes ; and I know some AWESOME , WONDERFUL people who go to public school . 	0
WD	34934	Healthy , wonderful people can come out of any education ; same for unhealthy people . 	0
WD	34935	There are such things as homeschool groups , and we get together just for the purpose of socializing . 	0
WD	34936	I have so many AMAZING friends now from homeschool events . 	0
WD	34937	There are exceptions to this , but this is true for the MAJORITY of homeschoolers : you get healthier socialization ! 	0
WD	34938	5 . ) 	0
WD	34939	I could go on forever , but I won ' t . 	0
WD	34940	So those are my main points . 	0
WD	34941	I would think it weird to talk to someone in another grade back at school , but I have friends I can honestly call BFFs ranging from age 11-23 . 	0
WD	34942	Plus , you ' re exposed to a wider age range when you ' re homeschooled . 	0
WD	34943	I can also see how child abusers could use home-schooling as part of their evil plans . 	0
WD	34944	The debate around single sex versus co-educational ( co-ed ) will always be a controversial one . 	0
WD	34945	That ' s nice I suppose . 	0
WD	34946	Everyone interested in education will have their opinion and although data would indicate that single sex girls ‚Äô schools might produce the best results , it would seem to be that there is more to this debate than just academic results . 	0
WD	34947	This is the reality of public education today . 	0
WD	34948	I have experience working in all boys ‚Äô schools and co-eds and although I have not worked in a single sex girls ‚Äô school , I strongly believe that the most important factor in all this is the school itself . 	0
WD	34949	I have a december baby and a may baby ‚Äî my dec son went to kdg at almost 6 b / c of a sept cutoff and my may son went to kdg at slightly over 5 ‚Ä¶ . 	0
WD	34950	I didn ‚Äô t debate and didn ‚Äô t lament ‚Äì - I did what the cutoff suggested AND guess what ? 	0
WD	34951	Around third grade , everything evens out and I see it with all the kids ‚Äì they are all doing what they are supposed to be doing when I look at both my sons and the rest of their classes . 	0
WD	34952	While history suggests boys are stronger at Maths and Science and girls are more linguistic , I believe this gender divide can be bridged by an educational framework which is inspiring and uses a range of teaching strategies . 	0
WD	34953	I totally agree that this segment was driven by helicopter parents . 	0
WD	34954	We must say that our kids are doing what they should be doing b / c they are who they are and not say things like performing at the top and exceeding this or that because IMO ‚Äì we just propel the argument . 	0
WD	34955	I did like what they speculated in the segment about what will be with all these kids as adults ‚Äì I am so curious ! 	0
WD	34956	RB 	0
WD	34957	I have seen this first hand as both a teacher and through lesson observations , as the Headteacher of North Bridge House School , it is the more social dynamic side to fully integrated co-eds that I believe to be so important . 	0
WD	34958	The issue of home schooling is one that always seems to spark a fierce debate , and a story published yesterday by the Washington Post is only likely to add fuel to the fire . 	0
WD	34959	Play , which is really a child ‚Äô s ‚Äò work , ‚Äô contributes to cognitive , physical , social , and emotional growth . 	0
WD	34960	Christian , Jewish , Muslim , Hindu , Sikh , Buddhist , Jedi , Star Trek , etc . . . 	0
WD	34961	The father doesn ' t appear very well educated since he doesn ' t seem to have steady employment other than being a handyman of some sort . 	0
WD	34962	No religious activities in schools . 	1
WD	34963	If there ' s a demand for single-sex schools , those should be an option available to families . 	0
WD	34964	The best way to respect all religions is to show favoritism to none . 	0
WD	34965	‚Äú Standardized tests and other pressures have changed the trajectory of elementary education . 	0
WD	34966	It is a totally deteriorated system , it needs to be torn down and start over with the same kind of private education that made this country great in the first place . 	0
WD	34967	Too many liberals who have been indoctrinated by public universities that have no standards of right and wrong or decent and immoral . 	0
WD	34968	Tried hard to change the public system . 	0
WD	34969	That ‚Äô s the practice of not starting a child in kindergarten until after his or her sixth birthday . 	0
WD	34970	A 60 Minutes segment this week focused on ‚Äú redshirting . ‚Äù 	0
WD	34971	The segment has generated a lot of conversation both online and in neighborhoods and preschools . 	0
WD	34972	It isn ‚Äô t because of school-district rules , but is something that parents do to give their child an advantage from kindergarten and beyond . 	0
WD	34973	As the mom of a boy with an August birthday and a September 1 cutoff in our school system , I was torn about the potential advantages of an extra year of preschool . 	0
WD	34974	Including the one my kids attend . 	0
WD	34975	I had the opportunity to discuss this issue with Ann Densmore , EdD , an expert in language and social communication skills in children and co-author of Your Successful Preschooler . 	0
WD	34976	( My husband was not . ) 	0
WD	34977	And believe me it has been an adjustment . 	0
WD	34978	Not just the private to public adjustment but also day care . 	0
WD	34979	The only reason why we decided to take out daughter of private school this year is because of the price . 	0
WD	34980	Up until now we were able to afford it , but with my long commute everyday and gas prices and all other prices not coming down we had to make a very difficult decision . 	0
WD	34981	Not only is the learning environment better and more organized so are the teaching practices . 	0
WD	34982	In the private setting she is not being taught how to pass a test so that the school can remain accredited or whatever she is being taught how to think and organize her ideas , and she is actually graded , and not passed along if she can just get by . 	0
WD	34983	Wow ! ! ! 	0
WD	34984	If I have the choice and the opportunity to do so I will gladly put her back in private scholl without hesitation . 	1
WD	34985	He likes it and seems excited by the prospect of being a big kid in school . 	0
WD	34986	* He knows a lot of the kids who will start kindergarten with him ( thanks to preschool ) . 	0
WD	34987	I like the fact that she is being challenged by her school work and even being pushed to begin learning at least a grade level higher . 	0
WD	34988	* He is familiar with the elementary school , a benefit of having an older sibling . 	0
WD	34989	For example , Ryan recently tried to help a friend at school and the friend ( politely , kindly , rightfully ) declined Ryan ‚Äô s help . 	0
WD	34990	Ryan ‚Äô s feelings were hurt so he hit his friend . 	0
WD	34991	The question mark is his maturity . 	0
WD	34992	He can be impulsive . 	0
WD	34993	Girls like reading ; boys don ‚Äô t . 	0
WD	34994	Not just lip-service investment , or property tax investment , but real flesh-and-blood-offspring investment . 	0
WD	34995	I think my view differs from my gal pals because I was able to leave and see the other side . 	0
WD	34996	She reiterated the fact that it all does depend on the person . 	0
WD	34997	And his wife appears to be so cowed she doesn ' t speak for herself . 	0
WD	34998	Often , those who do well academically / behaviorally are often left on their own unless a parent continually advocates for their dcs in order to ensure that things are done to help them reach their full potential . 	0
WD	34999	As wonderful as it is that students want to help take care of the inclusion students , calming down another student means that the child doing that is taking time away from his / her own learning , not the mention the initial distraction that the outburst created . 	0
WD	35000	The primary responsibility of the education of a child rests on the parents . 	0
WD	35001	This puts a tremendous amount of pressure on me , as I want to help all of my students , but can ' t provide the one-on-one time that my students need during class time . 	0
WD	35002	They went to school with them . 	0
WD	35003	They grew up with them . 	0
WD	35004	The point that I am trying to make here is that special education students already have a learning curve , so to speak , and we as teachers need to do everything we can to assist them . 	0
WD	35005	. 	0
WD	35006	My belief is preschool , kindergarten and even 1st grade should be exciting and fun so kids associate those qualities with learning . 	0
WD	35007	Another thing that I feel parents should be aware of : I personally found that girls who attend all-girls school will go out more to actually meet boys than girls in co-ed schools . 	0
WD	35008	What I mean by this is , girls in co-ed schools will hang out with boys from school ( inside and outside of school ) , yes , but the fact is : they know these boys . 	0
WD	35009	But that ' s just my opinion . 	0
WD	35010	Special education teachers see this and place more students in my classes than in other math teachers ' classes . 	0
WD	35011	"I know that seems like such a minor gripe , but trust me , you don ' t want to be surrounded by the bullshit girls can concoct amongst each other when there are no boys to "" restrict "" certain behaviours . "	0
WD	35012	Whether they can write their names in kindergarten is not the point . 	0
WD	35013	Students can pray all they want together or by themselves , and very few people actually argue against this , at least I think . 	0
WD	35014	Prayer in schools should not be led by a school official ( who is a gov ' t official if we are talking about public schools ) . 	1
WD	35015	I see no reason why kids need to have a school-led prayer , or a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance , for that matter . 	0
WD	35016	If teachers aren ' t willing to step up to the challenge , they shouldn ' t enter the teaching profession in the first place . 	0
WD	35017	Seriously . 	0
WD	35018	But here are my reasons : 1 . ) 	0
WD	35019	As a parent , I support that concept as long as the inclusion doesn ' t come at the expense of the other students in class . 	0
WD	35020	Each of these examples are a bias when there is no balance or equal time given to educate other views in the public schools . 	0
WD	35021	I believe that everyone should be allowed to believe whatever they want to believe and pray to whomever they want to pray . 	0
WD	35022	But what does bug me and what I do feel is unacceptable is when people try to impose they ‚Äô re religious beliefs FORCFULLY on someone else . 	0
WD	35023	Lastly , every person sending their children to private schools will pay for public schools as well through local taxing especially if real estate taxes fund that government system too . 	0
WD	35024	But you must donate so that I can build a better platform to get the word out that I can save people you must help me you must donate and don ‚Äô t forget , don ‚Äô t do this ‚Ä¶ this and this ‚Ä¶ or else you will not go anywhere remotely nice when you die . 	0
WD	35025	You know this sort of thing gets to me when people think that they are right about they ‚Äô re religion or topics . 	0
WD	35026	Ignorance is truly bliss . 	0
WD	35027	Now in lieu of that last statement I am not saying that I am right in anyway shape or form . 	0
WD	35028	People are always afraid . 	0
WD	35029	Always thinking of death and what could or won ‚Äô t happen next . 	0
WD	35030	Now if your scared enough and all of a sudden in what seems like coincidence , someone comes up to you and says hey you know what . 	0
WD	35031	I can save you I can save you from what ‚Äô s to come . 	0
WD	35032	If a student wishes to silently pray during my class , I do not have a problem with it . 	1
WD	35033	I ' m a teacher . 	0
WD	35034	I also don ' t think teachers / administrators leading prayers over the intercom or whatever are acceptable . 	1
WD	35035	Sandy 	0
WD	35036	He admonished his followers : ‚Äú Always beware of vowing , it is a risky thing . 	0
WD	35037	So why did we make all of the necessary sacrifices and send our four children through the private sector ? 	0
WD	35038	It ' s individuals like that who take away the right to choose and assuming it ' s just rich people who send their kids shows the ignorance in that statement . 	0
WD	35039	So , I guess we are bad parents because we put our faith in God first and foremost . 	0
WD	35040	The ‚Äú evangelical prophet , ‚Äù Oswald Chambers ( 1874 ‚Äì 1917 ) , saw that the empty promises made by so many Christians actually result in great ‚Äú spiritual leakage . ‚Äù 	0
WD	35041	I agree that this article is a crock ! 	0
WD	35042	My wife and I are both school teachers . 	0
WD	35043	I worked in the public system , and she worked in the Catholic school system in our area . 	0
WD	35044	In fact many middle class and even lower income folks use private education for their children . 	0
WD	35045	If you can ' t manage that then enroll your children in an alternative school . . . it really is that simple . 	0
WD	35046	It also bids the argument that religion plays a roll and it ' s an obvious attack against those schools who are affiliated that way . 	0
WD	35047	The public school system is secular , keep your religious beliefs at home . 	1
WD	35048	Why not use public schools here are a couple reasons they teach liberal sex education , they teach evolution , they teach homosexuality generally at an early age , and some even hold classes about certain religions . 	0
WD	35049	How long until Muslim schools girls are told to stop exposing their face in school ? 	0
WD	35050	Do you have a better idea ? 	0
WD	35051	Use the comment field below to voice your opinion . 	0
WD	35052	I see benefit to both sides of the argument . 	0
WD	35053	I just don ' t know what the best option is . 	0
WD	35054	SO while the lower performing student has an aid , that high performing student is bored to tears and on a behavioral rampage . 	0
WD	35055	"My daughter was 4 when she started kindergarten , turned 5 in late Sept . She thrived socially , but was definitely "" middle of the pack "" academically till the end of 2nd grade , when something kicked in , and she started caring more about doing well in school . "	0
WD	35056	Yes everyone can stand review but at a point you lose students . 	0
WD	35057	The students can opt out of their accomodations , and they do to save face , further , they are not only hurting themselves , but others in the calss . 	0
WD	35058	The resources teacher ( their aid ) can ' t sit by there side and give them the help and attention they need due to confidentiality . 	0
WD	35059	"We have gotten away from this "" tracking "" mentality , but really , the majority or resource kids I see are no better off . "	0
WD	35060	I have 32 kids in one class and an on level class is mixed beyond belief . 	0
WD	35061	I can attest to the idea that things even out by 3rd grade . 	0
WD	35062	Few children can rise above the poor education of a public school and that is why most of our leaders attended private schools and why they send their children to private schools also . 	0
WD	35063	My kids both have nice professional jobs . 	0
WD	35064	I pay my school taxes but public schools don ' t want my input , just my money . 	0
WD	35065	I just disagree that if public schools went away , all these wonderful educational facilities would magically spring up and everyone would be educated and the world would be a better place to be . 	0
WD	35066	You will never , ever regret it . 	0
WD	35067	Nor will your child . 	0
WD	35068	If you can ‚Äô t do that , explore the many good private Christian schools that are available . 	0
WD	35069	But please , consider doing something . 	0
WD	35070	Pressure to prepare kids for these tests starts as early as kindergarten . 	0
WD	35071	Later , as a parent , I changed direction and became worried about the behaviour that impeded learning and teaching in public schools- behaviour that I witnessed first hand . 	0
WD	35072	Consequently I chose to move my own children from public to private . 	0
WD	35073	I own up to being part of the problem of the weakening of the public system . 	0
WD	35074	I couldn ' t abide that my own values of respect , cooperation and high expectations were not being held for my children in the public system . 	0
WD	35075	The teachers in both systems are the same , but the expectations of the parents are simply different . 	0
WD	35076	I want for my children what my parents did not have to pay for ! 	0
WD	35077	If you have the ability to send your children to private school and choose not to , then it is clear that you love money more than your children . 	0
WD	35078	I helped paint classrooms and wash windows . 	0
WD	35079	Would a moment of silence be out of order ? 	0
WD	35080	This is absolutely the worst piece of garbage I have ever read ! 	0
WD	35081	We did without so we could send our kids to Catholic school . 	0
WD	35082	Why can ' t we have a moment of silence ? 	0
WD	35083	If public school parents don ' t like their ' crappy ' school then let THEM make changes . 	0
WD	35084	Other parents did landscaping , waxed floors , supervised recess , helped in the kitchen , repaired the furnace and water heater , maintained the school bus , and re-sealed the driveway . 	0
WD	35085	This is the way it has always been done in the Catholic school system . 	0
WD	35086	We have done our share . 	0
WD	35087	Where will that child be best prepared to succeed in college and beyond ? 	0
WD	35088	Like most certified teachers I did not hold this method of education in very high regard . 	0
WD	35089	If you wish to improve public schools the only answer is to get government out of education and turn it back to local control . 	0
WD	35090	, specifically my bias against homeschooling before doing the research . 	0
WD	35091	What is wrong with this country is public schools and people that believe that someone owes them something . 	1
WD	35092	"This is not about real "" choice "" . "	0
WD	35093	When middle-class parents go private , they are supporting a shift that will see public schools become a residual system for the poor . 	0
WD	35094	I find it deeply offensive when parents imply that they send their kids to private schools because they care about them more . 	0
WD	35095	There ' s plenty of evidence to show that the best thing you can do for your kids is engage with them ( ie . more time at home , less time at work ) and make their home life an enriching one . 	0
WD	35096	How well a child does at school depends on the child itself not the school it goes to . 	0
WD	35097	Attitude to studies is all important . 	0
WD	35098	I send my kids to public schools because I care about them - their links with their diverse local community etc - but also because I care about the kind of culture they live in . 	0
WD	35099	To me , learning to care about and contribute to society as a whole - not just your own personal interests - is the best value a child can inherit . 	0
WD	35100	All of our kids deserve to reach their full potential , regardless of their sex . 	0
WD	35101	I have written more than a hundred articles for this column and this has never happened before . 	0
WD	35102	If a student ' s mind is occupied with sex , drugs and alcohol you can ' t expect good results . 	0
WD	35103	Set high moral standards for your child and encourage the proper attitude to study and life in general and it won ' t matter which school he / she attends . 	0
WD	35104	The next thing I know there are thousands of readers ‚Äú recommending ‚Äù my article on their Facebook pages . 	0
WD	35105	Then I did the research and found , for the most part , that they are doing a fine job and I said so . 	1
WD	35106	All of us , no matter our religious beliefs , need to pray that the law changes before more smart children are left behind . 	0
WD	35107	That has changed because of immigrants , the world just in general becoming smaller through computers , TV . , and people becoming more independent from their own study and reading . 	0
WD	35108	When I was a kid we learned religion in church , math , reading , history , etc . , in school and at home . 	0
WD	35109	What will Americans do when Arabs wear headscarves , burkas to public school as is happening in Europe ? 	0
WD	35110	Why are some people making it so difficult , demanding that religion be taught also in schools , alongside science ? 	0
WD	35111	We have some problems to face , don ' t we ? 	0
WD	35112	Notice these are only women ' s wear , which creates another gigantic problem of suppression of the female ( Americans think ) . 	0
WD	35113	The entire world has these problems , not just here in America , and we are the guineau pigs . 	0
WD	35114	"Now just 38 per cent of Britons , according to a 2005 poll , believe in "" a God "" of any kind ( a further 40 per cent of people believe in "" some sort of spirit or life force "" , apparently , showing that the market for new-age waffly nonsense is still going strong ) . "	0
WD	35115	I can ' t remember the exact timeline ) homeschoolers to simply graduate . 	0
WD	35116	Why , because their parents pay for them to be there . 	0
WD	35117	After reading all the comments attached to this article I would like to address some of them : Thank you for your encouragement to homeschool my boys . 	0
WD	35118	In the end I would like to emphasise two things : 1 ) People have suggested that there are pros and cons , and yes , this is obviously true but the implication to some may be that all this ' washes out ' in the end . 	0
WD	35119	This is NOT true . 	0
WD	35120	Any decent school will have various other contacts . 	0
WD	35121	However , more importantly , a rounded upbringing includes children being involved in other extra-curricula activities that allows them all sorts of interactions with a wide variety of people . 	0
WD	35122	Science can be wrong , but by far I ' ll take science over anecdotal evidence . 	0
WD	35123	: ) Single-sex schools do not mean living in a monastry . 	0
WD	35124	Depending on who you speak to , there is also anecdotal evidence that there are significant risks in vaccination babies . 	0
WD	35125	But the science indicates that the risk is almost negligible . 	0
WD	35126	Again , do the research . 	0
WD	35127	Studies clearly establish that single-sex schools are , IN GENERAL , better for educational outcomes than co-ed schools . 	0
WD	35128	But ‚Ä¶ 	0
WD	35129	And I thought , sure , because she ' s a bright kid who ' s supposed to be in 2nd grade . 	0
WD	35130	But I didn ' t say it . 	0
WD	35131	Many who say money is a factor are simply choosing to spend their resources on other things when they could spend it on freeing up the possibility of homeschooling . 	0
WD	35132	Oooo - I had to bite my tongue to keep from saying almost the same thing , in a similar situation recentl ! . 	0
WD	35133	I have a July ' 07 girl whom I am sending to kindergarten this fall . 	0
WD	35134	I swear if I hear one more time ( and I know I will ) about how advanced her kid is . . . 	0
WD	35135	"I ' m just going to say "" so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? "" "	0
WD	35136	It went unsaid , but the message I got was that I was not doing the right thing , by sending mine . 	0
WD	35137	Many who say they are not temperamentally suited to homeschooling are using that as a smokescreen when the truth is they are not willing to exercise the patience and submit to the sacrifice needed to homeschool . 	0
WD	35138	I got into a conversation with another mom whose child was the same age , who was holding her daughter back . 	0
WD	35139	She was actually totally cool , said she was still kind of conflicted about her decision , respected others choices , etc . It was the other women there who jumped into our conversation and assured her that she was DEFINITELY doing the right thing , who annoyed me . 	0
WD	35140	My daughter does not let the overcrowded classrooms bother her . 	0
WD	35141	To this day , I believe it may be the most prophetic series I ‚Äô ve ever delivered at Meck . 	0
WD	35142	I do not believe homeschooling is for everyone , nor the mark of whether you are a good parent . 	0
WD	35143	The children in the public system , some , not all , are just waiting to get out at the end of the day . 	0
WD	35144	I know there can be economic barriers to homeschooling . 	0
WD	35145	Only to be more frustrated because there were about 60 kids in the tutoring session who all had questions . 	0
WD	35146	. 	0
WD	35147	At least one child died . 	0
WD	35148	Terrified students huddled in classrooms . 	0
WD	35149	They called 911 . 	0
WD	35150	They texted and tweeted . 	0
WD	35151	Teachers locked doors and implemented emergency procedures . 	0
WD	35152	And at least one teacher chased the gunman out of the school ‚Äì an act of bravery that possibly saved lives . 	0
WD	35153	As police try to make sense of the senseless , the school superintendent called on people to pray . 	0
WD	35154	It was a wise decision . 	0
WD	35155	But perhaps lost in the chaos is the irony that in American public schools ‚Äì people are not allowed to pray . 	0
WD	35156	Liberals have successfully banished God from the classroom , replacing Him with the manmade god of secularism . 	0
WD	35157	The kids are coddled , have no responsibility with the school system in this area . 	0
WD	35158	I think it sends the wrong message . 	0
WD	35159	It drives me nuts . 	0
WD	35160	"I am in no way "" Wealthy "" however I chose to send my children to private school that has a religion based background . "	0
WD	35161	After all , there are very few things one can do as a grown-up , short of joining a cloistered religious order , to be exclusively in a single-sex environment . 	0
WD	35162	I can learn and do schoolwork and still have time for loads of other experiences . 	0
WD	35163	They could do this at public schools but do not . 	0
WD	35164	The public school was a joke . 	1
WD	35165	So I think your argument needs a lot more supporting facts . 	0
WD	35166	It ' s a strange hangover from a time when Britain really was a majority Christian country . 	0
WD	35167	Seems to me that you would send your child to private school if you felt you had the means . 	0
WD	35168	Children in the public school systems ARE left behind , bullied , and not challenged enough in their own learning capabilities . 	0
WD	35169	Private teachers have more passion about teaching because they are free to write their own curriculum for each child based on developmental assessments and achievements to where each child is learning at the level they need to be at and not just a class as a whole . 	0
WD	35170	The teachers do not open up a text book and teach every child the same way . 	0
WD	35171	Sending your child to a private school is one of the best things you can do for them . 	1
WD	35172	Oh , but she ‚Äô s gifted ? 	0
WD	35173	This isn ' t the place to argue about Planned Parenthood , but the things they say to children as young as ten are things that shouldn ' t be said without a parent ' s permission . 	0
WD	35174	I went K‚Äì12 to a terrible public school . 	0
WD	35175	Well , then , she ‚Äô ll really be fine . 	0
WD	35176	You want the best for your child , but your child doesn ‚Äô t need it . 	0

WD	35181	Woahhh , guys , some of this is starting to get a little attack-y . 	0
WD	35182	For the purpose of this argument , I ' m referring to homeschooling as any kind of flexible education : online schools , unschooling , a hodge-podge of curricula from different places , anything . 	0

WD	35189	Even in the story in the original post , I think mainstreaming was a good thing . 	1
WD	35190	Now that this person has graduated from high school , he might not be able to go on and get the types of college degrees that his peers are pursuing but maybe he could be placed in some sort of work program or job training program to help him be as independent as possible . 	0
WD	35191	I agree with what other posters have said . . . it depends on the individual child and how high functioning they are . 	0
WD	35192	If the being in a mainstream classroom is good for them and doesn ' t interfere with other students ability to learn then it is a good thing . 	0

WD	35201	The effect of this ruling is not just to eat away at the sacredness of the name of God , but to eliminate the sacredness and thereby the substance of the oath itself . 	0

WD	35226	In a blog for Yahoo ! , Clayton writes that the real motivator behind downsizing special education classrooms by mainstreaming students with disabilities into general education classes is a desire to save money , not an effort to do what ‚Äô s best for students with disabilities . 	0

WD	35277	For the record , my parents aren ‚Äô t hippies , or God fearing Christians . 	0
WD	35278	Also to sate that home educating families are middle class could not be further from the truth , with four children and my father receiving a pitiful wage as a hill farmer and my mum being an unpaied housewife , they , nor I fall into the bizarre and inaccurate stereo type of a home educated family . 	0

WD	35281	As supporters of this campaign against public teachers unions , it only makes sense that the news media ignores important books such as The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools . 	0
WD	35282	Charter schools , vouchers for private schools , school and school district takeovers ‚Äî virtually all right-wing school reform efforts attack public school teachers because they are unionized and therefore make a decent wage . 	0
WD	35283	Weakening unions is one key strategy in the thirty-year class war in which wealth has been transferred from the middle class and poor up the economic ladder to the wealthy . 	0
WD	35284	The news media will certainly give fair coverage to both sides of most labor disputes , but in feature coverage they give far greater voice to anti-union pundits , writers , politicians , theories and events than to those in support of unions . 	0

WD	35289	Are private schools better or worse ? 	0
WD	35290	Should private schools be allowed to compete with public schools ? 	0
WD	35291	However , school vouchers are illegal in most states , so this solution is not available to most parents . 	0
WD	35292	The most common solution to this problem is called a school voucher , which is essentially a tax rebate for parents that they can use to pay private tuition . 	0
WD	35293	What do you think ? 	0
WD	35294	Many polls have indicated that the American public is supportive to the idea of school vouchers , but national teacher ‚Äô s unions oppose them , and so far they have not become a mainstream alternative to public school . 	0
WD	35295	The primary obstacle to creating more private schools is cost . 	0
WD	35296	A private school can choose to create a new curriculum for auto mechanics if it wants to , and doesn ‚Äô t need to ask the government for permission or funding . 	0
WD	35297	Many parents do not have enough money to both pay school taxes and pay for tuition at a private school . 	0

WD	35329	The non-public school director has said repeatedly that we are welcome to take our child out of her school since she has a waiting list , whenever we have brought up concerns . 	0
WD	35330	( Our biggest concern was the revolving door that teachers were on in 2006 / 07 : 3 teachers quit in 1 year . ) 	0
WD	35331	The non-public school has a very unwelcome attitude towards parent involvement , and even to questions and concerns that parents may raise . 	0
WD	35332	The idea that child abuse can be thwarted by tightening laws about home education has been around for some time . 	0
WD	35333	It seems that Khyra ' s last hope was that the local authority ' s home education support team might intervene once her mother had withdrawn her from school . 	0
WD	35334	What does that tell ya about are public school system ? 	0
WD	35335	He reached the same conclusions as this week ' s serious case review ‚Äì that the law be changed to ensure that social services speak to children to assess if home education is in their interests . 	0
WD	35336	My problem is when a parent doesn ' t put the effort in to socialize the kids , they are in too narrow of a group of friends and not allowed any friends out side of that group . 	0
WD	35337	They will take away your rights to homeschool based on the outcome of the testing , I think that ' s a good thing . 	0

WD	35347	In this age group ( senior high school ) , the benefits were larger and more consistent across the board for girls than for boys . 	0
WD	35348	"The National Foundation for Educational Research conducted a study in which they observed and calculated of 2 , 954 high schools ( both co-ed and single-sex ) throughout England and found , "" Even after controlling for students ' academic ability and other background factors , both girls and boys did significantly better in single-sex schools than in coed schools .

WD	35349	It is very clear by the above chart that both sexes academically benefit from a single-sex education . 	0
WD	35350	But then we have studies that show the numbers . 	0

WD	35358	Age wise I was right in the middle of my class at school and I was far ahead of my class . 	0
WD	35359	Yes , out public school system is broken , but until the PARENTS start caring and actively participating in the education of their children and stop making it solely the schools ' job , nothing is going to change . 	0
WD	35360	I remember when I went to public school and it just seemed that the teachers cared about more than their yearly raises and making sure the school got enough money each year from the government . 	0
WD	35361	However I feel that the school struggles to meet her needs due to lack of experience and always fighting for funding . 	0

WD	35365	The kids intergrated into the lessons they were able to and had lessons within the unit . 	0

WD	35367	I was a paediatric Occupational Therapist and worked in both special needs schools and mainstream environments and saw successes and failiures in both . 	0
WD	35368	I think it must be a mindfield for parents having to make this choice and despair at the battles they face for funding appropriate eductation for their children . 	0
WD	35369	I can see the benefits of both types of schooling for differnt children . 	0

WD	35404	None of these are compelling reasons . 	0
WD	35405	Or , rather , the compelling ones ( behavioral or learning issues , wanting a not-subpar school for your child ) are exactly why we should all opt in , not out . 	0
WD	35406	Yes , some do it for prestige or out of loyalty to a long-standing family tradition or because they want their children to eventually work at Slate . 	0
WD	35407	But many others go private for religious reasons , or because their kids have behavioral or learning issues , or simply because the public school in their district is not so hot . 	0
WD	35408	I believe in public education , but my district school really isn ‚Äô t good ! 	0
WD	35409	you might say . 	0
WD	35410	We are also far from rich . 	0
WD	35411	Last week I learned the definition of ‚Äú going viral . ‚Äù 	0
WD	35412	"I didn ' t feel equipped to teach him and he got nothing from my lessons , and when he was "" blowing "" neither did anyone else . "	0
WD	35413	There , I said it . 	0
WD	35414	Every single solitary teacher I ' ve spoken to about this says that any differential based upon age pretty much disappears by the time the child is in 3rd grade . 	0
WD	35415	I can see it right now at the end of second grade - to the extent there were differences because she was so young are completely eliminated . 	0
WD	35416	FWIW - I think for many kids you can tell in kindergarten and first . 	0
WD	35417	But being at the tail end of this , you can ' t tell after that . 	0
WD	35418	So the question is : Why do people hold their kids out a year when the District says this is when the kids go ? 	0
WD	35419	If you really can ' t tell - why don ' t you just follow the rules ? 	0
WD	35420	You honestly cannot tell the difference in the ages of the kids . 	0
WD	35421	"Every once in a while a child might stand out but it ' s not that often and the reason they are standing out is usually not because they seem "" older "" or "" younger "" I don ' t necessarily disagree with you . "	0
WD	35422	The teacher says she can ' t tell any difference at all . 	0
WD	35423	As the temporary alliance between Liz Sayce and Maria Miller proves , this can make for some very unlikely bedfellows . 	0
WD	35424	BUT teaching in a class of 35 without support was silly . 	0
WD	35425	Preparing special work for the ADHD / Autistic / severely limited children was not a problem , a joy , really , and my job ! 	0
WD	35426	No wonder students who have been divided by sex for years need help learning how to work and learn together . 	0
WD	35427	Here ‚Äô s the bottom line : many of our schools are in trouble and coming out of the largest recession since the 1930s , with mounting national debt , we have limited resources . 	0
WD	35428	Perhaps this outcome isn ‚Äô t surprising . 	0
WD	35429	Social scientists have found that labeling and separating students based on almost any characteristic ( e . g . , sex , eye color , randomly assigned t-shirts ) makes those differences even more salient to the students and produces intergroup bias . 	0
WD	35430	Got that ? 	0
WD	35431	Instead of focusing on techniques that have been proven to improve academic outcomes , the school has to spend its limited resources teaching boys and girls to play well with each other . 	0
WD	35432	So , the right of kids to pray in school is not only not banned , but even constitutionally protected . 	0
WD	35433	In fact , the Bill of Rights ‚Äô First Amendment protects both the right to freedom of speech ( prayer can obviously be a form of speech ) as well as the right to free exercise of religion ( praying also obviously qualifies as exercising one ‚Äô s religion ) . 	0
WD	35434	Kids pray all the time in school ( often right before a quiz or exam ) . 	0
WD	35435	This is nonsense . 	0
WD	35436	The dearest private schools with long heritage of generations of pupils from the one family don ' t show it theses days . . . 	0
WD	35437	Sports on Saturdays music classes drama classes etc the catholic school that ' s says 95% is reflecting their area . . 	0
WD	35438	Having previously discussed why teaching creationism in public school science classes , or posting the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms , are both inappropriate and unconstitutional , I suppose it ‚Äô s perhaps time now to take a look at the whole heated issue of the place of prayer in U . S . public schools . 	0
WD	35439	Article failed to justify the heading lost the plot along the way . . 	0
WD	35440	However , please note that these constitutionally protected legal rights and freedoms apply only to people , and not to the government . 	0
WD	35441	And , in actual fact , no one is officially disallowing kids to pray in school whenever they want ( so long as it isn ‚Äô t disruptive , of course ‚Äî a basic school rule that equally applies to other sorts of free speech and forms of self-expression ) . 	0
WD	35442	Today , parents who homeschool don ' t even worry about high school or diplomas . 	0
WD	35443	Still , it seems that should be some oversight to prevent children from falling through the cracks . 	0
WD	35444	Both sides of this debate have a compelling case . 	0
WD	35445	And it is entirely possible that some children might receive a better education at home than they would in any of the available schools they could attend . 	0
WD	35446	Unfortunately , for parents who cannot afford private education , live in certain suburbs or who want to send their children to a public school , the selective system is the only one that will nurture and encourage them to learn and grow amongst peers who want to learn . 	0
WD	35447	Parents should not be judged for trying to do what ' s best for their children . 	0
WD	35448	I also recognize that there are deep roots to explore when we look at who is attending private versus public schools , and it certainly bears looking at why people make those choices , rather than dismissing them as not compelling enough like Benedikt does . 	0
WD	35449	Using Benedikt ‚Äô s rational , if everyone sent their kids to public schools they would somehow magically improve . 	0
WD	35450	And due to cost , location , waiting lists , and other issues , sometimes Catholic school or another private school is not an option ( though home schooling versus Catholic schools has been a whole other debate ) . 	0
WD	35451	Out in the Western suburbs , where we can afford to live , public high schools just won ' t do unless you ' re happy for your kids to be beaten up , spat on , thrown rocks at , and depressed going to a school full of delinquents who swear at teachers & disrupt the class all day . 	0
WD	35452	How can they learn and grow in such a place , even with high involvement and support from home ? 	0
WD	35453	Don ' t need statistics , just need to put your kids into the public school system to know they ' re being disadvantaged through under resourcing and teachers ill-equipped to deal with the policies they are meant to be managing , i . e . bullying , attire , social attitude , etc . The number of parents pulling their kids from the public system speaks for itself in how the public system is operating . 	0
WD	35454	Pulling my kids out of the public system was the best thing we ever did for them ! 	1
WD	35455	An outgoing & popular bright teenager transformed into one hiding in closets to avoid school . 	0

WD	35457	We tried it . 	0
WD	35458	Pulled one of our kids out of a private school into the local public school . 	0
WD	35459	Sometimes local public schools are themselves doing a poor job of educating students . 	0
WD	35460	I don ‚Äô t think my family is the worst-case scenario , ‚Äù he told the Post . 	0
WD	35461	‚Äú Who knows how many of these families are out there ? 	0
WD	35462	However , it should be made clear that coeducation can also foster good mental and emotional situations . 	0
WD	35463	Since private schools compete with each other to gain students , they have a strong incentive to hire good teachers and offer good courses . 	0
WD	35464	For a variety of reasons , boys in a classroom has an overall negative impact on girls ' learning . 	0

WD	35477	But being a social scientist I can ' t help but look to the literature ( incidentally , the well-researched footnotes are one of Lean In ' s strongest features , and worth a read ) , and that ' s when the picture becomes more complicated . 	0
WD	35478	At 13 I would have said that of course girls need to be bossy -- who else would lead ? 	0
WD	35479	As far as prayer in school , I think a moment of silence to allow a private prayer of any type for anyone who wishes to give such is most appropiate . 	1
WD	35480	I took this attitude with me into high school , a building that sat next to an all-boys ' school . 	0
WD	35481	Some of my classes were coed . 	0
WD	35482	"The boys came over for European history and drama , classes where I always positioned myself in the front row , preferring the "" visiting "" boys sit behind me . "	0
WD	35483	To my teenage self they were clearly infringing on my territory and I made sure I outperformed them . 	0
WD	35484	That confidence translated when I went next door for Latin , where I righteously covered my tests with my arm to make sure the boy sitting behind me couldn ' t cheat off of me ( a trick he only got away with once ) . 	0
WD	35485	When I arrived at Harvard ( also Sandberg ' s alma mater ) I was never afraid to raise my hand in a seminar , and I quickly learned that the best way to be heard meant jumping into the discussion and not waiting to be recognized . 	0
WD	35486	Most institutions now accept parents ' transcripts , letters from community members , SAT scores and entrance exam scores as proof of achievement . 	0
WD	35487	Colleges and universities are now recognizing that homeschooled children ' s education is as well-rounded as that of their peers . 	0
WD	35488	In the private school system , the administration is more able to deal with the difficult student , even if that mean expelling them from the school . 	0
WD	35489	All of these situations encourage development of social and conflict-resolution skills , expect courteous and respectful behavior and expose children to diversity . 	0
WD	35490	While it is true that they may not spend six hours of every day with same-age peers , many homeschooled children are from large families , are involved in extracurricular activities and lessons , and volunteer in the community . 	0
WD	35491	Socialization One of the most common arguments against homeschooling is that children who learn at home will not have opportunities to socialize with their peers . 	0
WD	35492	Others might purchase commercial online or DVD-based curricula . 	0
WD	35493	Some may hire a tutor or belong to a cooperative where parents take turns teaching in their area of expertise . 	0
WD	35494	This may have been accurate in the past but today , even if parents do not have the required skill set , they have many options . 	0
WD	35495	Meeting Academic Standards Another argument against homeschooling is that students may not be exposed to the same rigorous curriculum standards at home as they would be at school , which would make it difficult to be accepted at postsecondary institutions . 	0
WD	35496	Sadly , my college chose to go co-ed years ago . 	0

WD	35525	After all , the public school systems get tax money from everyone , even from the one ' s who send their kids to private schools . 	0

WD	35564	Additionally , private schools are not encumbered by national teacher ‚Äô s unions or political correctness . 	0
WD	35565	Private schools that compete with each other for students will be forced to find the best teachers available , and will be able to offer flexibility that meets each individual ‚Äô s educational needs . 	0
WD	35566	OTOH , one does read and hear about people who withdraw children from school because they have some dispute with the school about discipline ( school tries to , parents object ) or because the school has failed to address bullying concerns . 	0

WD	35592	The report that an increasing number of parents in this country are seeking to homeschool their children is not at all surprising . 	0
WD	35593	However , some persons expressed confusion about this admission from an official of the Ministry of Education recently , because of the high standard of education we afford our children at the nursery , primary and secondary levels . 	0
WD	35594	But rich people will always find a way to game the system : That shouldn ‚Äô t be an argument against an all-in approach to public education any more than it is a case against single-payer health care . ) 	0
WD	35595	( Yes , rich people might cluster . 	0
WD	35596	The media coverage here and abroad about bullying , teasing as well as physical and emotional abuse in public schools is abundant , and it could make a parent want to protect their children from that bad environment . 	0
WD	35597	Certainly there are advantages and disadvantages to homeschooling and if it is an area that is gaining currency in this country , the relevant authorities will need to do some probing to ensure that parents are giving their children instruction in the right manner , and are not in fact putting their children at a disadvantage . 	0
WD	35598	Unless there are individual circumstances I wouldn ' t be sending my children to a single sex school . 	1
WD	35599	Indeed , if homeschooling is really on the rise , Government may have to seek parliamentary approval to institute laws and regulations to govern this method of teaching . 	0
WD	35600	Yet most slum dwellers would much prefer their governments to open schools . 	0
WD	35601	Low-cost private schools thrive in very particular contexts ; for example , they flourish in illegal slum settlements in marginal urban areas , where governments fail to provide public schools because they do not recognise the settlements . 	0
WD	35602	Simple analysis shows that this is the result of the government failing to invest in education . 	0
WD	35603	Low-cost private schools are also evident in other contexts : for example , where government services are largely absent , such as in rural Pakistan . 	0
WD	35604	In doing this , the DFID is following in the ideological footsteps of the World Bank . 	0
WD	35605	Over the past three years , the Department for International Development ( DFID ) has made the controversial move to support low-cost private schools in some countries , such as Nigeria , Ghana , or Pakistan , where public education systems are in desperate need of investment . 	0
WD	35606	This begs the question of whether or not is it a good use of public money from UK taxpayers to invest speculatively in for-profit private schools in poor countries ? 	0
WD	35607	Indeed , a recent DFID Guidance Note on low-cost private schools argues that such schools have a key role to play in expanding education provision , despite acknowledging the fact that ‚Äú there is still a lack of data and comparative analysis on education outcomes to assess value for money ‚Äù . 	0
WD	35608	I support public school with my taxes and do help the public schools by lowering their class size with one less child . 	0
WD	35609	It certainly is not surprising , therefore , that Christian parents and those who have strong belief systems choose to homeschool their children instead of their developing questionable values in the public school system . 	0
WD	35610	I want my child to have a education that supports my religious beliefs and reinforces what I teach at home . 	0
WD	35611	In this context DFID ought to be making the case for increased domestic investment , as it is the only sustainable solution . 	0
WD	35612	Pakistan spends only 2 . 4% of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) on education against a benchmark of good practice of 6% of GDP . 	0
WD	35613	Then , in first grade , we asked he be placed in inclusive classrooms for non-academic subjects with an aide . 	0
WD	35614	He made academic gains and seemed very happy . 	0

WD	35616	So he ended up in a segregated , structured special ed . classroom . 	0
WD	35617	We didn ' t know the questions to ask , period . 	0
WD	35618	First of all , we didn ' t know he had a right to inclusion . 	0
WD	35619	In real life , it hasn ' t worked so well for my son . 	0
WD	35620	In theory , I absolutely support inclusion . 	0
WD	35621	What a hypocritical message we send to our children when we allow laws to be passed which limit the free expression of speech in public by banning public prayer in classrooms . 	0
WD	35622	Federal and Supreme Court judges should be impeached who undermine the freedom upon which this country was founded . 	0
WD	35623	He didn ' t have any friends among the peers without disabilities . 	0
WD	35624	By the second semester , it became apparent he was slipping behind academically in his special ed . classes . 	0
WD	35625	But that ' s a whole bag opened : why do some parents not care ? 	0
WD	35626	‚Äîbut there is always going to be bullying . 	0
WD	35627	On the other hand , some parents were fabulous , agreeing to hand me the leads to the X-Box until I decided the work had improved , or calling on my phone in my lesson to check up . 	0
WD	35628	That , not race , is the difference . 	0
WD	35629	It ' s not something I expect to improve under this government , which has already basically written off a whole sector of society as not worth it . 	0
WD	35630	the fact that they feel comfortable enough telling me is testament to this fact . 	0
WD	35631	It ‚Äô s a lesson I sadly suspect our nation ‚Äô s educators will never learn . 	0
WD	35632	"‚ÄîThe boys forget how to act around women and go cuckoo bananas when they go on a field trip together ‚Äîmany girls complain about it ; however , many others have told me that they like it because they are insecure about "" being bad readers "" and feel more comfortable in an all-girls environment .

WD	35633	The fervency with which school prayer is opposed is not because the ACLU ( an anti-Christian legal group ) is trying to protect atheist from being indoctrinated by religion . 	0
WD	35634	I teach single sex classes to 7th and 8th grade students IN the Bronx similar to in the article and here is what I ' ve found . 	0
WD	35635	Humanism assumes that the supernatural does not exist and that reality must be discovered purely from man ' s reasoning . 	0
WD	35636	Our public school system has been operating on this foundation since prayer was removed in 1962 . 	0
WD	35637	Since prayer was eliminated from public schools , the quality of education has shown a steady statistical decline . 	0
WD	35638	Is there a link between the two ? 	0
WD	35639	It tells students that they are more than just a collection of chemicals and energy that happen to be occupying space and time . 	0
WD	35640	Returning prayer to school would be an affront to this philosophy because prayer acknowledges the existence of someone greater than man . 	0
WD	35641	Allowing prayer in school sets an important standard . 	0
WD	35642	As much as I hate a lot of things that happen in public education , give me that stupidity over the utter lunacy of teaching kids about invisible father figures in the sky . 	0
WD	35643	Of course , then they could learn about the earth being flat and that big flood too . 	0
WD	35644	You mean when most children weren ' t educated at all , they just worked on their parent ' s farm and a large percentage never learned to read or write ? 	0
WD	35645	Let ' s face facts , if we did away with public education , most private schools are religious these days , that ' s where people would have to turn . 	0
WD	35646	I know that there are plenty of homeschoolers who turn out just fine . . . but I ' ve never met them in reality . 	0
WD	35647	Again , I do apologize if anyone finds this offensive in any way . 	0
WD	35648	Because I was never allowed to socialize with them as a child . 	0
WD	35649	Why ? 	0
WD	35650	One was the youngest in his class . 	0

WD	35655	The other is the 2nd oldest in his class . 	0
WD	35656	After thousands of bedtime stories and hundreds of trips to the library , books were only as good as the pictures . 	0
WD	35657	In fact , The National Home Education Research Institute ( NHERI ) reports that homeschoolers actually participate in approximately five different social activities outside the home on a regular basis : boy / girl scouts , dance , swimming lessons , Sunday School , 4-H , homeschool co-ops , sports , theater , music classes and field trips . 	0
WD	35658	Honestly ? 	0
WD	35659	I do however think that one of the biggest pros to homeschooling though ( for those who do it properly and not take advantage of the way the system works ) is that kids can learn at their own pace w / o having to slow down or speed up to suit another child in their class . 	0
WD	35660	More students attending public school doesn ‚Äô t automatically mean more involved parents either . 	0
WD	35661	How would you feel about you 6th grade daughter being in the classroom with a 17 year old predator ? 	0
WD	35662	I went to both , public and private . 	0
WD	35663	The essential difference were the students . 	0
WD	35664	And it makes all the difference . 	0
WD	35665	How would you feel about your child having to endure being bullied and taunted daily and when he reports it to the teacher nothing is done to the bully but your kid gets the snot beaten out of him ? 	0
WD	35666	I wholeheartedly support public education and in fact , our plans include sending our son to public middle and high school . 	1
WD	35667	Or ‚Ä¶ they ‚Äô d be overcrowded . 	0
WD	35668	The way the current system works , schools in lower-class neighborhoods are overcrowded and underfunded , while schools in wealthier districts enjoy the benefits of higher taxes ‚Äî and yet , even many of them are also underfunded . 	0
WD	35669	I wish we had a better way to fund schools then based on property lines and tax dollars . 	0
WD	35670	Benedikt , in her push to help promote public education , seems to think that the best way to fix the public school system is to shame parents into sending all the kids there . 	0
WD	35671	And when you complain you will be told that there are procedures that must be followed . 	0
WD	35672	The current formula for funding public schools doesn ‚Äô t automatically mean a bunch more money per school for each new student who enrolls . 	0
WD	35673	Overcrowding public schools isn ‚Äô t going to solve anything . 	0
WD	35674	Every school function I went to most all the parents couldn ' t speak English and the kids would act like they was a little gang member or something . 	0
WD	35675	So , the data about the high percentage of the home-schooling students that graduate and that attended top universities such Harvard , Stanford , Yale , etc . is based on those students I saw in that award ceremony . 	0
WD	35676	No more will she ever go to a public school again . 	1
WD	35677	My children went to Catholic School so they could receive a religious education , attend mass daily , be safe , and learn . 	0
WD	35678	And she always said the Mexican kids was really mean to her . 	0
WD	35679	In public school she was the only Caucasian kid in her class in third grade . 	0
WD	35680	This will be her second year . 	0

WD	35682	As a disabled person with an interest in politics , the conversation sometimes turns to education . 	0
WD	35683	I have a right as an American to send my children to private school and by the way we are not rich by ant means . 	0
WD	35684	The media often frame the argument as one of ‚Äú integration ‚Äù and ‚Äú segregation ‚Äù . 	0
WD	35685	However , I personally feel that this is a gross oversimplification which sometimes leads those who proclaim to be allies of the disabled down risky paths . 	0
WD	35686	This was made clear to me last year when disabled charities advocated the closure of the Remploy factories on similar grounds . 	0
WD	35687	I tried SO hard to understand , I didn ‚Äô t want to be ‚Äò behind ‚Äô the other kids , but it was no good . 	0
WD	35688	Not having it . . . . . . So you can judge and tell me I ' m wrong , but my kid is making way better grades then she was when she was in public schools . 	0
WD	35689	This week , examiner . com is having a promo called , ‚Äú The Great Debate : to homeschool or not . ‚Äù 	0
WD	35690	Why are public educators and superintendents concerned about the growing number of parents who are homeschooling their kids ? 	0
WD	35691	No matter how hard I tried it was not good enough . 	0
WD	35692	Public schools are help hostage by state and federal govenments . 	0
WD	35693	I was home educated from aged 10 onwards ; my parents were the most fantastic , enthusiastic teachers . 	0
WD	35694	Despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators they have no control over curriculum , what happens in the classroom , discipline , or anything else . 	0
WD	35695	Public schools are not influenced by parents , that ' s hooey . 	0
WD	35696	My personal experience of mainstream school was damaging . 	0
WD	35697	My parents didn ‚Äô t take me out of school to ‚Äò protect me from the world ‚Äô , good grief what a stupid thing to do ! 	0
WD	35698	I wrote this paragraph on a prior commentary because it is a fallacy that a great percentage of the home-schooling students attended top universities : I disagree that all the public schools in Maryland are bad . 	1
WD	35699	The most obvious reason is that with fewer students enrolling in public school , there will be lesser funds going into the system . 	0
WD	35700	Also remember that there ‚Äô s more to education than what ‚Äô s taught . 	0
WD	35701	Being Jewish , nun wasn ‚Äô t really an option . 	0
WD	35702	Thanks in part to Sandberg and her Facebook team , I know that many of the girls I attended middle and high school with have made a variety of different choices as women : some are married , many have children , and some are stay-at-home moms while others are doctors or lawyers ( one even premiered at the Metropolitan Opera this month , while still nursing her five-month-old son ) . 	0
WD	35703	But we can know how people assess their experiences -- like me and my former classmates . 	0
WD	35704	This knowledge and the confidence that comes with it can ' t be discounted . 	0
WD	35705	I wasn ‚Äô t going to an all-women ‚Äô s college , and how many jobs are there where there are strictly women in the workplace ? 	0
WD	35706	Other studies have acknowledged that all-girls ' education doesn ' t necessarily improve academic performance , but they haven ' t found that it hurts either . 	0
WD	35707	Short of being able to do twin experiments ( where one identical twin goes to a coed school and the other goes to a single-sex school ) , we may never know the precise effect of what learning in a single-sex environment does for girls . 	0
WD	35708	A well-publicized 2011 Science paper disagreed , proclaiming that single-sex education can have a long-term negative effect by promoting gender stereotypes . 	0
WD	35709	And while we ' re at it , ladies , it ' s also worth remembering that shaving your legs every day isn ' t a necessity -- and not doing so leaves more time for all kinds of leaning in . 	0
WD	35710	Of course not . 	0
WD	35711	In fact it ‚Äô s part of the reason I feel so strongly about public schools . 	0
WD	35712	Give me a break ! 	0
WD	35713	His argument was that because girls are more structured and academically oriented than boys that more girls in the classroom would give the boys more ‚Äú positive school behavior ‚Äù to model . 	0
WD	35714	In study conducted by Mieke Van Houte ( 2004 ) he examined whether or not the presence of girls affected the achievement and behavior of boys . 	0
WD	35715	Boys take a more laid-back approach , work less hard , and are distracted more quickly . 	0
WD	35716	‚Äú In general it is stated that girls spend more time doing homework , display less disturbing behaviour in the classroom and play truant less often . 	0
WD	35717	I believe the far more important thing to consider in the single-sex vs . coeducational debate is whether or not the attitudes and emotions of the children involved are adversely or positively affected . 	0
WD	35718	It has been noted in the previous sections that single-sex education can provide a more structured learning environment for both boys and girls . 	0
WD	35719	So maybe the debate really has no footing at all , maybe it is just inherent that boys do not like school as much as girls ? 	0
WD	35720	‚Äú Recently , various studies have demonstrated that boys are less motivated than girls and hold less positive attitudes towards school than girls ( Van Houte , 2004 ) . ‚Äù 	0
WD	35721	In another study conducted by Salomone ( 2006 ) she states ‚Äú There is some indication that single-sex classes may develop greater self-confidence and broader interests especially among adolescents ‚Ä¶ . girls report that they feel more comfortable ‚Ä¶ interact more with teachers ‚Ä¶ and develop more favorable attitudes towards these subjects ( math and science ) . ‚Äù 	0
WD	35722	( Van Houte , 2004 ) ‚Äù The study found that indeed the more girls that are in the classroom , the better the boys perform ( Van Houte , 2004 ) , it also found out that it is not so much the mere presence of girls as it is the proportion of girls . 	0
WD	35723	Some children , depending on disposition , may enjoy a single sex school more as they may not make friends from the other sex easily , and being solely around children of their own sex could develop their self-confidence . 	0
WD	35724	Advantages to sending your child to a single sex school include : children will be encouraged to learn how to interact with the other sex , despite not being able to interact every day . 	1
WD	35725	They are also exposed to how different the opposite sex can be , and how to cope with situations that come with being in a co-ed school . 	0
WD	35726	Children are able to interact daily with those from the opposite sex , allowing them to develop their social skills and have a variety of friendships . 	0
WD	35727	Let ‚Äô s look at the advantages to sending your child to a co-ed school . 	1
WD	35728	Since each child is different , there is no specific formula to decide on a school . 	0
WD	35729	Since , the ultimate decision lies with the parents , focus needs to be on how the child would respond to either type of school , based on their personality , interests and general likes and dislikes . 	0
WD	35730	Parents often debate this issue , with many having issues with both co-ed and single sex schools . 	0
WD	35731	The author completely misses the reason why I send my children to private school as well as how to help the education system as a whole . 	0
WD	35732	Being aware of your child ‚Äô s personality is crucial in determining which school you should choose , regardless of whether its co-ed or single sex , since a school ‚Äô s academics , sports and cultural activities are vital issues . 	0
WD	35733	I couldn ' t come up with a more illogical argument . 	0
WD	35734	Parents of private school kids know absolutely nothing would change in the few years their children would attend a public school , even if they voiced their concerns . 	0
WD	35735	So , why waste valuable development years in a childs life when a parent could enroll their child in a private school and give them a better education immediately ? 	0
WD	35736	Seriously , do you think the same teachers who continually go on strike for better wages and less demanding grading scales would listen to parents and actually incorporate suggested changes into their classrooms ? 	0
WD	35737	Unfortunately that has me paying for my children to attend private school , and me paying for BOTH types of education . 	0
WD	35738	A 2009 study by professors at UCLA ' s Graduate School of Education & Information Studies presented data that graduates of all-girls ' schools show stronger academic orientations , especially in math and computer skills , and higher standardized tests scores , than their coed counterparts . 	0
WD	35739	But there was actually a gross violation of the third commandment by the U . S . Supreme Court a year earlier . 	0
WD	35740	When asking friends about whether they preferred public or private schooling for their children I got varied responses : some moved to be near a good public school , others sent their children to private schools because they wanted better discipline and to give them a social and professional head-start for when they left school , and one had tried both and saw pros and cons in each system . 	0
WD	35741	Then there are the fees for education . 	0
WD	35742	On the other hand , when your child excels in a particular area , such as music , languages or sports , or you want your child to have a spiritual education , it might be worth considering schools that have a curriculum focusing on those subjects . 	0
WD	35743	Most of those are private . 	0
WD	35744	Debate constantly rages about public funding of private schools , regardless of the school ‚Äô s wealth raised from fees and donations . 	0
WD	35745	Money will definitely be an issue for us to consider when it comes to deciding which school our sons will attend . 	0
WD	35746	Public schooling is by-and-large free , with voluntary annual fees at around several hundred dollars . 	0
WD	35747	Private schooling costs thousands of dollars . 	0
WD	35748	When all the evidence for public and private schooling is boiled down , I think the most important factors are sending your children to a school where they are safe , secure and will receive a good education from high calibre teachers . 	0
WD	35749	There are schools in both the public and private systems where these factors are paramount , so it is up to us as parents to find the school that ticks as many of our boxes as possible . 	0
WD	35750	Not to mention do you really think anyone wants to pay taxes for the public system and pay huge $ for the private education . 	0
WD	35751	It ' s just like everything else the government has involvement with , failure ! ! 	0
WD	35752	He began to start not caring about school itself , he was very bored . 	0
WD	35753	I ended up pulling him out in 5th Grade into to private education through High School . 	0
WD	35754	I had several issues with the public education system not being able to keep up with my son who happened to be 3 grades ahead of his age level . 	0
WD	35755	Many conversations with the Principal and teachers . 	0
WD	35756	I made 7 . 50 / hr and was able to get an income based grant through the school . 	0
WD	35757	It was the best investment I had made . 	0
WD	35758	"Or recite over and over "" there is no God ? "" "	0
WD	35759	And so , some may argue that single-sex education promotes gender-issued stereotypes . 	0
WD	35760	"After just two weeks , the researchers reported that children who had the teacher using sex-specific language played less with children of the other sex . "" "	0
WD	35761	My proposed solution would be to create co-ed , public schools that separate the sexes for the subjects of math and science ( debatably the two hardest , most demanding subjects taught in high school and the subjects that evoke the stereotype threat ) and create co-ed environments for all the other subjects . 	0
WD	35762	At the end of the day is it up to the parents : sacrifice your child ' s appreciation and cooperation with the opposite sex for a more specialized , concentrated academic environment ? 	0
WD	35763	This utopian schooling system would essentially provide the best of both worlds . 	0
WD	35764	Then , teachers could focus on targeting the needs for each sex when it comes to math and science , and incorporate both males and females for all other aspects of high school life . 	0
WD	35765	As a former educator , I believe that every child deserves equal access to education in the least restrictive environment possible . 	0
WD	35766	Private schools succeed where public schools fail largely because in a public school the teacher ' s hands are tied by politically correct nonsense . 	1
WD	35767	These hardly constitute the totality of private schools in this country . 	0
WD	35768	So before drawing any definitive conclusions , we need to know how other private schools compare . 	0
WD	35769	Perhaps a study by Luis Benveniste , Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein provides an answer . 	0
WD	35770	"They concluded that "" the social , cultural , and economic backgrounds of the parents and the community in which the school was located seemed to be the main determinant of variation , much more so than a school ' s public or private character or , within the latter group , whether it was religious or secular "" ( All Else Equal , RoutledgeFalmer , 2003 ) . "	0
WD	35771	In short , they operate entirely differently . 	0
WD	35772	Therefore , I ' ll go a step farther . 	0
WD	35773	Even when socioeconomic factors are controlled , I don ' t think it ' s fair to compare private schools with public schools . 	0
WD	35774	I also hasten to note that most of the schools in the Lubienskis ' study were religious schools . 	0
WD	35775	We live in between two very highly-regarded public schools , and he will probably attend the local primary school as it is walking distance from our house and many of his friends from day care will be going there too . 	0
WD	35776	AND , then other schools down the line , like The Freshman Academy , are forced to spend their limited resources undoing the damage done by single-sex classes rather than , again , implementing proven techniques to expand academic achievement . 	0
WD	35777	"I wasn ' t equipped to deal with a lad with lowered learning and physical disabilities that meant he "" broke "" really easily either , and seeing him fitting and falling from the chair in my lesson easily rates as one of the scariest moments of my life , until the support got there . "	0
WD	35778	Where does that child get the best education ? 	0
WD	35779	What matters is what is best for that child ' s personality ? 	0
WD	35780	In all honesty , it does not matter which avenue of education grants the best socialization . 	0
WD	35781	You don ' t sit next to them everyday , so you make time to spend with them no matter where they live . 	0
WD	35782	Deep connections are encouraged because you must go out of your way to see your friends . 	0
WD	35783	Some families homeschool year round , taking a month off between semesters to visit family and friends who live out of state . 	0
WD	35784	The opportunities to socialize quite likely outnumber those of public school because of the flexible time schedules . 	0
WD	35785	There is football , cheerleading , sign language , music , etc . There are field trips , playdates , study groups , Bible studies , conferences ( for all ages , not just the parents ) , and the list goes on . 	0
WD	35786	You know the rules , so if you take a job that makes you an agent of government , you need to respect the Constitution . 	0
WD	35787	Carry your Bible and pray if you want , but do it privately . 	1
WD	35788	I would have thought that a Christian would respect the rights of others , especially the rights of children . 	0
WD	35789	The teach in a private school or don ' t teach . 	0
WD	35790	All this time I thought it was God who was supposed to be worshiped . 	0
WD	35791	Not so with Bible thumping literalists . 	0
WD	35792	But much of it is mythology . 	0
WD	35793	Then you can continue to worship your silly book . 	0
WD	35794	Talk to your child about the routine in kindergarten and give him or her a schedule using pictures or words , depending on your child ‚Äô s reading level . 	0
WD	35795	Ask the teacher if you can take photos of the room . 	0
WD	35796	‚Äù See if you can meet the teacher before September . 	0
WD	35797	And there are many ways ( beyond the myriad children ‚Äô s books on the subject ) to help prepare your child . 	0
WD	35798	He was fine , and somehow thrived . 	0
WD	35799	I sobbed when I dropped our son off on his first day‚Äînot delicate weeping , but chest-heaving sobs . 	0
WD	35800	As with so many things in parenting , you can only be so prepared . 	0
WD	35801	The more your child and you know , the more comfortable everyone will be when starting this new chapter . ‚Äù 	0
WD	35802	only God himself can turn this world around and i believe He is tired of all the corruption caused by man . 	0
WD	35803	He is soon to return so we all need to be ready when He comes . 	0
WD	35804	hi . i am a 35year old lady who would love to see prayer back in the schools . 	1
WD	35805	i am writing a paper for my college writing class about the situation . 	0
WD	35806	invite the Lord in and watch the transformation . 	0
WD	35807	prayer should be done openly and privately . 	0
WD	35808	please lets get prayer back in the schools to eliminate all the violence . 	1
WD	35809	I mean why not ? 	0
WD	35810	I have a great solution to this problem - 3 day weekends anyone ? 	0
WD	35811	In Canada , no Christian would ever have to choose between going to Sunday service , and going to school . 	0
WD	35812	I didn ' t . 	0
WD	35813	Did you know that schools are still legally required to make children perform acts of Christian worship in schools ? 	0
WD	35814	"Which is why it came as something of a shock to read today that "" the vast majority of schools are flouting the law by failing to stage a daily Christian assembly "" . "	0
WD	35815	I had no idea . 	0
WD	35816	Parents can opt their kids out , but the children themselves have no say in the matter . 	0
WD	35817	Apparently , under the 1944 Education Act , it is required that schools provide ‚Äú broadly Christian worship ‚Äù every schoolday . 	0
WD	35818	I vaguely remember some at primary school , but that was a CofE-run establishment so it ' s hardly surprising . 	0
WD	35819	I was surprised to learn that , because when I was at secondary school ‚Äì a reasonably ordinary comprehensive in Oxford ‚Äì there was , to my memory , not a single prayer assembly in the five years I was there . 	0
WD	35820	Assuming my experience was at least vaguely representative of the nation ' s , this is hardly a new situation . 	0
WD	35821	I left school a dozen years ago . 	0
WD	35822	Jewish prayer in schools is not a problem , because their Holy day is Saturday , also a day when there is no school . 	0
WD	35823	I don ' t know . 	0
WD	35824	It ' s certainly better than letting religion brainwash your children , which seems to be the other alternative . 	0
WD	35825	Christians , this is not a time to bring up the ‚Äò if prayer should be in schools ‚Äô debate , because it ‚Äô s a worthless cause . 	0
WD	35826	Instead , let ‚Äô s teach people what it means to pray , even if that means not being seen at all . 	0
WD	35827	You don ‚Äô t need to have your prayer mandated by schools or government , but you also don ‚Äô t need to draw attention to yourself while praying . 	0
WD	35828	Done ! 	0
WD	35829	Prayer that doesn ‚Äô t change the one praying isn ‚Äô t prayer either . 	0
WD	35830	When prayer left the schools it reminded the church that prayer is the Christian ‚Äô s responsibility and not the governments . 	0
WD	35831	It made parents , Sunday school teachers and pastors teach the students what prayer really was , and it is a lot different than some recited sentences once a day or scenes in the smoking section . 	0
WD	35832	It made us rethink what prayer should look like , and rethink what Jesus meant when he said prayer shouldn ‚Äô t be on the street corners making scenes but in our rooms in private . 	0
WD	35833	 The student will develop a persona that they are always bigger , better , and have the upper hand , which might be challenging in their future ,  she said . 	0
WD	35834	"This is a large developmental gap when trying to get through the state standard curricula , "" said Vela . "	0
WD	35835	There are mixed results on whether redshirting is helpful for the child in the long run . 	0
WD	35836	 Even though most school districts want the child to be at least at the age of five , the cut-off date for joining differs according to school district and state ,  said Vela . 	0
