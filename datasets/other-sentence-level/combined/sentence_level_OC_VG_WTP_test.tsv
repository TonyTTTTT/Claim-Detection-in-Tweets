VG	956	So the doctrine of justification by faith , which has strong support in the Christian scriptures , leads inevitably to exclusivism , to the idea that all who reject Christian doctrine must be damned , no matter how good they may be , by ordinary standards . 	1

VG	1035	It is crucial that this specialized form of bankruptcy relief for family farmers not be allowed to sunset for two fundamental reasons . 	1
VG	1036	First , family farmers , absent chapter 12 , would be forced to file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code ' s other al-ternatives , none of which work as well for them as does chapter 12 . 	0
VG	1037	Chapter VII of the Bankruptcy Code , for instance , would require a farmer to liquidate ; that is , sell the family farm to pay the claims of the farmer ' s credi-tors . 	0
VG	1038	Many farmers would be precluded from choosing bankruptcy relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code be-cause of its restrictive eligibility standards . 	0
VG	1039	Furthermore , Chapter XI , the Bankruptcy Code ' s business reorga-nization alternative , is not farmer-friendly in various respects , as it often entails an expensive and time-con-suming process that does not readily accommodate the special needs of farmers . 	0
VG	1040	Second , recent statistics dem-onstrate that there is not only a con-tinuing need for chapter 12 , but that this need is apparently increasing . 	0
VG	1041	Ac-cording to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts , chapter 12 bankruptcy filings jumped by more than 62 percent over the past year . 	0
VG	1042	I in-troduced H . R . 2465 to extend chapter 12 for an additional 6 months through De-cember 31 , 2003 , and thereby maintain the status quo while the Congress com-pletes its consideration of comprehen-sive bankruptcy reform . 	0

VG	1079	I would reject the first hypothesis for two reasons . 	0
VG	1080	First , it is the practice of parliamentary draftsmen to show an abundance of caution and to favour the avoidance of doubt . 	0
VG	1081	In considering the intention of Parliament when passing the 1985 Act , or perhaps more properly the intention of the draftsman in settling its terms , there are three ( but only three ) hypotheses to be considered : ( 1 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was regarded as clear that the 1938 Act would continue to operate , in cases to which it applied , irrespective of the terms of Part V ; ( 2 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because it was not in the mind of the draftsman of Part V ; ( 3 ) that reference to the 1938 Act was omitted because Part V was not seen to encroach upon or conflict with the operation of section 5 . 	1
VG	1082	9 . 	0
VG	1083	The Prime Minister has described global warming as the most serious environmental threat to the planet , and we know that a major accelerator is the emission of carbon dioxide and other carbon gases . 	0
VG	1084	British Energy has pointed out that the generation of about 64 TWh or 64 , 000 GWh by its nuclear power stations avoids the production and generation of about 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide . 	0
VG	1085	Secondly , had the draftsman conceived that a secure tenant ' s right to buy could be subject to a condition of ministerial consent under section 5 that right would not have been defined in section 118 in the terms quoted in paragraph 7 above , and provision would have been made for asserting and admitting or denying , and handling , claims to exercise the right to buy where ministerial consent was required . 	0
VG	1086	If I concluded ( as I do not ) that section 5 was intended to operate in cases covered by Part V , I would agree with Buxton LJ that the Part V procedures could be made to work , but the absence of any indication that the procedures were devised to apply to conditional rights fortifies the inference that section 5 was not intended to operate in cases covered by Part V . Had it been so intended , the draftsman would have imposed a duty on a local authority to refer to the Secretary of State a claim to exercise the right to buy made by a tenant whose case fell within section 5 . 	0

WTP	1169	Rather it relies on the fact that all organisms have commonalities to them which are best explained by a common ancestor ( such as nucleotides , cell membrane , chirality of amino acids , genetic code ) ; notice that none of these can be used to create a phyloenetic tree of biodiversity as they are present in ' all organisms in the exact same state ( there are exeptions of course , but they are minor ) . 	0

WTP	1212	An anecdote , however exciting , is not a reliable source for a medical article , and even if the overwhelming surge of media coverage compels us to include it for now , it should not command its own section of the article . 	0
WTP	1213	In any case , what a handful of rock journalists have said is beside the point , considering that progressive rock , art rock , experimental rock and alternative metal are used more often in relation to the band ' s music , and they have none of the musical elements associated with the term " nu metal " . 	1

WTP	1246	Its probably far lower than such abuse cases in any other profession , whether it be a doctor , dentist , store worker , gym instructor , etc . . . we shouldn ' t make the article to pander to an American ( especially the sensationalistic media ) viewpoint only , since its supposed to represent the whole world view IMO . 	1
WTP	1247	Don ' t get me wrong , I agree that its good we have an actual figure , to disprove anti-catholic propoganda , but I think it could just as easily fit in " Vatican II and beyond " as its not relevent to the world in a full overview , I think thats the point Xander was trying to get across too . 	0

WTP	1320	I don ' t think you are making a clear point Levine2112 . 	0
WTP	1321	However then you go one to say that these sources are themselves pseudoscientific because they are authorities on pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	1322	Such authoritative sources speak for the consensus in the scientific community . 	0
WTP	1323	Authorities in science which make comments on pseudoscience are not pseudoscientific themselves . 	0
WTP	1324	That is a very careless argument . 	1
WTP	1325	Also the presence of sources which support one viewpoint does not mean that contrasting viewpoint sources are needed if the contrasting sources are fringe science . 	1
WTP	1326	Neither are authorities which specialize in discussing pseudoscience provided they stick to scientific consensus . 	0

WTP	1348	What we have to remember is that this is not a list of pseudosciences , but rather a collection of topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable source . 	0
WTP	1349	Does that make sense ? 	0
WTP	1350	I think with proper attribution and context ( historical , academic , etc . ) , we can include items which even in our heart of hearts know are not pseudoscientific and there won ' t be any NPOV problems with this article . 	0
WTP	1351	Being included in this list means not that the item is pseudoscientific , but rather that it has the unique distinction of having been called pseudoscientific by some notable source . 	0

WTP	1353	But when we act like this - when we disallow based on our own views - then we have an NPOV problem on our hands . 	0
WTP	1354	Some of us seem to be making a judgment based on our own views of what is and what isn ' t pseudoscience , and we feel that it is wrong to mention psychoanalysis in the same breath as phrenology . 	0
WTP	1355	I hope my verbosity has cleared up my point and has not obscured it even more . 	0

WTP	1363	Everything else can be part of History of the Israel Defense Forces , which for some reason no one wants to work on . 	0
WTP	1364	Therefore I believe there should be a controversy section but it should be small and deal with controversies that have historical significance . 	0
WTP	1365	Moreover , Wikifan is quite right about not having such sections for other armies . 	0
WTP	1366	I bet some Wikipedians would like that , but this would not lead to a balanced article . 	0
WTP	1367	If you can find such sources , it would be interesting to have a look , but if we including the Liberty incident , we might as well have a 100-page controversy section detailing every screw-up the IDF has ever made . 	0
WTP	1368	I ' ve read a few books on general IDF history ( as opposed to specific episodes ) , and none of them talk in-depth about the USS Liberty incident or attribute it significance in the long term . 	0
WTP	1369	However , from an historical point of view , it ' s a fairly small incident that had almost no influence on anything . 	1
WTP	1370	The USS Liberty incident is well-known because it was one of the greatest friendly fire debacles in Israeli history and also as one of the main US-related incidents in IDF history . 	0
WTP	1371	As Shuki correctly noted , we have to put the events in perspective . 	0
WTP	1372	I fully agree . 	1
WTP	1373	I was just expressing dissatisfaction with the meme , which makes a comparison between Bush ' s administration and Obama ' s that is superficial in every way except the realm of political fallout . 	0

WTP	1379	I think it is OR to assume that the archaic slang was abandoned because of the sexual slang . 	0

WTP	1381	I agree that archaic slang doesn ' t add much understanding . 	0

WTP	1383	" In the past there were varying levels of belief in a flat Earth , but this was displaced by the concept of a spherical Earth due to observation and circumnavigation . 	0
WTP	1384	The human perspective regarding the Earth has changed following the advent of spaceflight , and the biosphere is now widely viewed from a globally integrated perspective . 	0
WTP	1385	This is reflected in a growing environmental movement that is concerned about humankind ' s effects on the planet . " 	0
WTP	1386	Oddly enough , none of these people are referred to as " denialists . " 	0

WTP	1391	So , in fact , source reliability comes down to whether or not the source is trustworthy at representing the characterization reliably . 	0
WTP	1392	The lead even states that some of the items included in this list are not necessarily pseudoscientific , but merely have been characterized as such by some notable source . 	0
WTP	1393	Characterize , in terms of the inclusion criteria in the lead of this article , is weaker than definitively labelling something . 	0
WTP	1394	We are no longer just looking for sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience , but rather just looking for notable sources which are regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of characterizing topics as pseudoscience . 	1
WTP	1395	So , in terms of WP : RS , our focus has shifted from the article which I described in the paragraph above . 	0
WTP	1396	For instead of relying on sources which satisfy PSCI and can be used to definitively call something pseudoscience , we allow for merely notable sources which have in some way , shape , or form characterized an item as pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	1397	This is what we are currently working with - a list with grey inclusionary criteria . 	0
WTP	1398	Grey comes in when this article ceases being a " List of pseudosciences " and instead is a " List of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
WTP	1399	Now where does the " grey " come in ? 	0
WTP	1400	Does that make sense ? 	0
WTP	1401	What ' s the problem now ? 	0
WTP	1402	One way the other side of that argument makes its case is to point to Israel making exactly the same charge against Hezbollah and showing how that was received / resolved . 	0

WTP	1407	There is a lot more to the subject than that , and images don ' t have to be of dead bodies themselves . 	1
WTP	1408	It doesn ' t boil down to censorship at all , it boils down to not having an article full photographs of dead bodies from the last century ' s wars . 	0
WTP	1409	I think people are intelligent enough to make the connection between Atilla the Hun charging into Rome and there being some death here and there - if there wasn ' t I ' m awfully confused as to why they have all those weapons , and why they are in such a hurry . 	0
WTP	1410	The fact that it ' s difficult to sucessfully falsify , and no-one ' s done it , doesn ' t make it pseudoscience by any stretch . 	0

WTP	1421	The title is thrown around constantly to many different artists ( Beyonce , Mariah , Mary J , Ciara ) and to put it as a fact in the beginning of the article is invalid and not noteworthy due to the source being one article on a gossip website . 	0

WTP	1430	You can merely present the information available at the time . 	0

WTP	1435	The point being is that just because something is thought to be incorrect , does not make it so . 	0
WTP	1436	EDIT : I will rescind my view to put a picture into the article . 	0

WTP	1439	How is it that I ' m saying Hamas " . . . isn ' t targeting cvilians " ? ? ? ? 	0
WTP	1440	I only add that the U . S . , israel and almost every other country that has waged war in history , targets civlians AS WELL ( as per the definitions of the Geneva Conventions ) , so it is only fair to use the term " employing terrorist tactics " on the " Hamas " wiki page ONLY if the same standards are used on the wiki pages of other governing bodies who have been shown to " employ " the same " tactics " . 	0
WTP	1441	As my statement ( and supporting references of the Geneva Convention articles and news sources ) clearly show that I DO believe Hamas targets civlians . â¦ â¦ 	1
WTP	1442	Hamas isn ' t targeting civilians . . . . " , then maybe a course in English would be a logical step for you BEFORE engaging in disscuasions in that particular language . 	0

WTP	1444	No problem . 	1
WTP	1445	Zionist regime and Zionist entity are one and the same . 	1
WTP	1446	one cannot exist without the other and if one exists so does the other . 	0
WTP	1447	by definition and as declared by the zionist congress , a zionist entity and a zionist regime can only exist in the land of zion , palestine / israel and if one doesnt exist how can another ? 	0
WTP	1448	However , the section is now light years ahead of what it used to be before the rewrite , and I ' d prefer it if we didn ' t slowly work to return it to the very poor condition it was in . 	0
WTP	1449	It is true that I unilaterally picked what should be mentioned , taking into account scale , significance , and pratical prose / style concerns . 	0
WTP	1450	It is recentism and shouldn ' t be there . 	1
WTP	1451	Why it shouldn ' t be there : as much as the conflict seems significant , it actually does not appear to be that important in an historical perspective , the way we should be looking at the article . 	0
WTP	1452	It appears that a reference to the recent conflict in Gaza keeps being re-added at a rate of once per 2 days or so . 	0
WTP	1453	This article needs some unbiased editors or sane people will continue to see it as a joke fan page , not an encyclopedic entry . 	0

WTP	1455	That would surely help to clarify the debate , educating people as to why there it is a controversial subject . 	0
WTP	1456	Similarly , why are there no pictures of abortion procedures , or of foetuses that have been aborted ? 	0

WTP	1472	It ' s amazing how this was re-added about 50 times but no one until now noticed this comment that ' s been here since May . 	0
WTP	1473	Anyway , comparing Operation Cast Lead to the Second Lebanon War is clueless at best . 	1
WTP	1474	It follows a recent trend in worldwide media to assess the scale of a conflict by civilian casualties , which , indeed , is completely irrelevant . 	0
WTP	1475	The Second Lebanon War was far larger in scale , both military and political . 	0
WTP	1476	But forget that ; the real problem with adding this " war " is that it ' s not even a war . 	1
WTP	1477	Aside from the media , there is no evidence that the historical record refers to it as a war ; it is simply recentism . 	0
WTP	1478	Comparetively , Operation Defensive Shield was also referred to as a war by many media sources , and probably Operation Litani ( although I wasn ' t alive then and so couldn ' t follow the media ) . 	0
WTP	1479	In addition , Israel very clear defines what is a war and what isn ' t , so at least the first instance of the addition , which clearly refers to " Israel ' s wars " , shouldn ' t be there . 	0
WTP	1480	In light of the above , I have two very important questions for you , which I request that you ( and anyone else wishing to add information about Cast Lead to this article ) address : â 	0

WTP	1486	I certainly hope , along with many others , that this finding will lead to a true cure for HIV infection . 	0
WTP	1487	At the same time , our enthusiasm for this report must be tempered by a realistic view of both the history of sensational announcements in HIV research and our goals at Wikipedia . 	1
WTP	1488	From time to time , we see a report on the nightly news that HIV infection or AIDS has been " cured " . 	1
WTP	1489	The recent announcement by Gero HÃ¼tter , first in the media and later as a case report in the NEJM , is quite notable and also very encouraging . 	0
WTP	1490	What do other users think about this and about the relative weight the Berlin case should be assigned ? 	0
WTP	1491	I think there should be a note on this while the discussion goes on - this is something that seems to me clearly relevant to the IDF and doens ' t include anything that I would think would require deletion . 	1

WTP	1526	What accounts for that counter-intuitive 20% drop in the HIV - > AIDS progression rate from the subjects infected 10 and 15 years prior ? 	0
WTP	1527	This is slightly confusing ( at least to me ) because the abstract also mentions that only 68% of HIV-positive subjects infected 14 years prior progressed to AIDS . 	0

WTP	1543	Is RevolutionIslam . com notable enough to be given coverage in this article ? 	0

WTP	1545	It ' s not ROS ' fault that the truth IS shocking , and his suggestion shouldn ' t necessarily be shot down for it . 	0
WTP	1546	If there is a crowded street in Calcutta with starving children , although it contains " shock value " to see it , it ' s the truth , isn ' t it ? 	0
WTP	1547	So I think they ' re fair as they are . 	0
WTP	1548	And in regard to the two pictures already up in the abortion debate section , although the editor wanted a " better quality " picture for the pro-choice representation , one could also argue that the pro-life representation contains about three people , while the pro-choice one is a sea of people . 	0
WTP	1549	Just because Ros has a blatant anti-abortion bias does not mean that his argument has no value . 	0
WTP	1550	I think both sides of the debate here have very good points , and I would like to see what Ros might come up with . 	0
WTP	1551	If a picture that accurately represents an abortion - or perhaps one being performed ( he does mention abortion procedures in his first post ) - can actually be agreed upon by a majority as something worthwhile , I don ' t see a problem with it being added . 	0

WTP	1562	I think we need to only include those parodies that have reliable sources for them , or are from well known sources . 	0
WTP	1563	" Sad Kermit " has been mentioned in at least two major newspapers , and the " Family Guy " parodies qualify as they ' re from a major TV series so they both qualify . 	1

WTP	1567	Ultrasound . 	1
WTP	1568	I think not . 	0
WTP	1569	Nonetheless , we seem to have acheived a consensus : more illustrative images would be a good thing , but " shock " pictures will not be accepted unless the article somehow directly concerns such images ( e . g . in the pro-life article , perhaps ) . 	0
WTP	1570	The article on amputation shows a hand minus two fingers . 	0
WTP	1571	Should that picture be moved to the hand article ? 	0
WTP	1572	I noticed this change to the article " In fact recent research has calculated that only one per cent of those convicted by Inquisition tribunals eventually received death penalties " A previous source used said that 3-4% of those convicted in the Spanish Inquision were executed . 	0
WTP	1573	1% may be accurate over all of the Inquisitions , but I think this will need to be made more clear , since the previous sentences detail the Spanish Inquisition . 	1

WTP	1576	Roland Deschain : I did not mean that the net energy output of the sun is zero . 	1
WTP	1577	Instead , I meant that the net energy gain of the earth is zero . 	0
WTP	1578	I ' m sorry , I think I didn ' t explain it properly . . . 	0
WTP	1579	The current sentence says " The Sun provides a large amount of energy to the Earth , and this flow of heat results in huge increases in entropy " - which is true but it ignores the fact that the earth is emitting all of this energy back into space . 	0
WTP	1580	The point of all of this is that since the net effect is an increase in entropy outside of the earth , the earth can " afford " to lose entropy without violating the second law . 	0
WTP	1581	Therefore the " entropy argument " by the creationists is faulty . 	1
WTP	1582	All energy taken in from the sun is emitted back out into space . 	0
WTP	1583	The net effect of this is a net increase of entropy in the system that includes the sun and the space , and that ' s what I meant by saying that the sun is a " source of negative energy " . . . 	0

WTP	1588	I am not sure about why this might be considered to be undue weight . 	0
WTP	1589	The IDF , rightly in my view , has a history of claiming the high moral ground in its general conduct , with abuses being unusual rather than the norm . 	0

WTP	1594	I dont think that you would want to be alive after you lose your cognition , you probably would ' nt want to do much of anything . 	0
WTP	1595	I think that a person with no physical signs of life would in fact be considered " clinically dead " and if they were resuscitated they were never truly dead , just clinically dead . 	0

WTP	1622	Well Roland i am glad about your contribution , given the FACT that i defined what i meant with scientific fact , and what its definition is , namely " facts ( = scientific consensus ) " i think you merely contributed in an additive fashion by reciting the definition of what scientific concensus means . 	1
WTP	1623	Cool . 	0
WTP	1624	It would be a yes or a no situation - or as I say above - it would be a black-or-white situation . 	0
WTP	1625	Either we have sources which verify that the scientific community generally considers a topic pseudoscience or we do not ; and that determines whether we would include it in such a list or not . 	0
WTP	1626	This means that these sources represent the general consideration of the scientific community . 	0
WTP	1627	I was saying that if a source is regarded as trustworthy / authoritative in terms of definitively naming topics which are and aren ' t pseudoscience ( a reliable source for describing what is and what isn ' t pseudoscience ) , then in terms of Wikipedia these sources satisy WP : PSCI and we can use them to definitively describe a topic as pseudoscientific . 	0
WTP	1628	I definitely wasn ' t calling any sources " pseudoscientific " . 	1
WTP	1629	@Sifaka - As you suspected , you misunderstood what I wrote ; probably because my language wasn ' t clear . 	0
WTP	1630	We could call this " List of pseudosciences " where either an item is clearly pseudoscience and it is included or it is not clearly pseudoscience and it is not included . 	0
WTP	1631	There would be no need for " characterized " in the title of this list , because per PSCI , we can definitively label items as " pseudoscience " if the sources show that the item is generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community . 	1
WTP	1632	If all we were using in this article were these kinds of sources , then we would not merely be listing items that have been " characterized " as pseudoscience , but rather listing items that are pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	1633	I would imagine that these sources include highly-regarded scientific journals and various academies of science . 	0
WTP	1634	One of the reforms of the Council of Trent was regarding education for priests so we should have something - I think - in the article that establishes the Catholic Church requirements - even if it is to the bishops discretion up to a point which I think it is . 	1

WTP	1640	I don ' t think it ' s fair to have one image of a few pro-life activists and another image of a huge crowd of pro-choice activists . 	0

WTP	1649	Some of the Lebanese , Maltese , Tunisian and even some Somalis still consider themselves descendants of Phoenicians . . . 	0
WTP	1650	So instead of saying some Lebanese , I would suggest to change the word " some " to the word " most . " 	0
WTP	1651	From what I know , at least most of the Americans of Lebanese ancestry are 85% Phoenician . 	1
WTP	1652	Sorry , no . 	0
WTP	1653	The analogs to this position are " Master of the house " or " Lord of the house " , and hence the improbable " First Master " and " First Lord " . 	0

WTP	1655	" First Master " or " First Lord " will never happen ; it wouldn ' t even occur to the people concerned . 	0
WTP	1656	The point is that nobody know what unofficial title , if any , would be applied to the husband of a female president . 	0
WTP	1657	Regarding the language or have her husband act as an analogous " First Gentleman " , " First Master " , or " First Lord " . 	0
WTP	1658	But the title of " First Lady " reflects on the social duties of being " Lady of the house " . 	0
WTP	1659	First Gentleman is a good guess , and is pleasing to the ear due to the assumed balance between " Lady " and " Gentlemen " . 	0

WTP	1681	I haven ' t looked at " power metal " , but if funk metal is so poorly-sourced in its own article that it cannot be sourced from mainstream rock journalism , then it really isn ' t a " genre " , but a " sub-genre " or " style " at best . 	0
WTP	1682	WP : OTHERSTUFFEXISTS isn ' t a great argument . 	0
WTP	1683	Especially when the Church stance is clearly outlined to respect and accept them . 	0
WTP	1684	I think full discussion of something like that would belong in Anticatholicism or Criticism of the Catholic Church of which we already have an article dedicated to . 	0
WTP	1685	- 	0
WTP	1686	That would fail to mention that the Church is pro-life in regards to abortion , contraception and euthanasia though , which I feel is important to point out if we ' re going to directly address those issues . 	0
WTP	1687	It would also fail to mention that the sexual abuse scandal is condemd by Catholic thought just as much as secular thought . 	0
WTP	1688	If the Pope " aproved " of them , then that would be a different situation . 	0
WTP	1689	I honestly don ' t think for an institution spanning over 2000 years the " homosexual intercourse " thing is important / relevent enough to warrant a mention in the intro . 	1
WTP	1690	I am going to make mention of the fact that the Inquistions were not as bad as people have been led to believe via Protestant propaganda because this fact is mentioned in three of my best scholarly works and I think it is anti-Catholic POV to not mention this important fact . 	1
WTP	1691	This is why the Geneva Conventions clearly state that any use of a " protected " place for military purposes strips it of those protections , and the presence of " protected persons " , i . e civilians , does not prevent a legal attack . 	0
WTP	1692	Your " reasoning " regarding this issue is your own fringe opinion , contradicting the accepted rules of warfare . 	0
WTP	1693	By including the information to justify Mary ' s actions but NOT the information to justify Elizabeth ' s , the article displays a pro-Catholic POV . 	1
WTP	1694	Catholic Spain wanted to invade England to restore Catholicism and some of her own Catholic subjects launched plots to try to overthrow her . 	0
WTP	1695	Along the same lines , you can ' t understand Elizabeth ' s laws without looking at what she was going through . 	0
WTP	1696	Those readers would be better served with a brief description of what the Creed says and a wikilink to the full text if they are interested in more information . 	0

WTP	1709	True , in it ' s original conception by Darwin , the thoery was heavily focused on natural selection , but 150 years of work within biology , genetics , immunology , embryology have expended the thoery to such a degree that saying it is just a theory of natural selection is a gross oversimplification . 	0

WTP	1780	No " technically " about it , there is no flag for the Island of Ireland and such things certainly do not need to be placed in the info box which would lead to a major dispute . 	0
WTP	1781	Despite this , I think that is exactly what is happening right now . 	1
WTP	1782	Because most of us here - myself included - would agree that psychoanalysis or Darwinism is not pseudoscientific , we are reluctant to allow their inclusion in this list regardless of whether or not we have notable sources asserting such a characterization . 	0
WTP	1783	It ' s not a yes or no situation . 	0
WTP	1784	Well , this could be nearly any notable source which presents such a characterization . 	0
WTP	1785	Above , I said , " When we allow some notable gray and not some other notable gray , then this article will suffer of NPOV violations . " 	0
WTP	1786	What I meant was that we can ' t pick-and-choose which notable sources we want to use and which ones we don ' t based on the merits of which topics the sources are characterizing as pseudoscience . 	1
WTP	1787	The list , the inclusion criteria , and the types of sources allow for grey . 	0
WTP	1788	Does that make sense ? 	0

WTP	1793	My so-called misleading version was much less misleading than the version which replaced it , which read " Following the war of independence , Ireland was split into two parts in 1922 : the newly independent Irish Free State which left the United Kingdom , and Northern Ireland which remained in the United Kingdom " . 	0
WTP	1794	Thank you . 	0

WTP	1799	Barak Obama hasn ' t even completed one term , so this argument doesn ' t make much sense . 	0
WTP	1800	George W . Bush is not a fair comparison , as he has had two terms and has had some of the lowest approval ratings of all-time and is not a very popular president in general . 	1
WTP	1801	OK but the paragraph is still misleading . 	1
WTP	1802	Can we experiment with some different wordings to try to include more of the most important facts and do so in a non-wordy way ? 	0
WTP	1803	I think your recent changes have improved the paragraph but I think it is still misleading . 	0
WTP	1804	I invite you to consider changes that will reflect what your research reveals in the preceeding two paragraphs . 	0
WTP	1805	I am going to change the propaganda sentence because I still think it is misleading . 	0
WTP	1806	Karanacs specifically asked for that figure and I think it lends NPOV to include the info , I would like to make her happy here . 	0
WTP	1807	Maybe there is an easy way to provide that context you desire regarding the 3-4000 people . 	1

WTP	1813	However , the Congregation pointed out that " for all " is not a literal translation of the words that Matthew 26 : 28 and Mark 14 : 24 report that Jesus used at the Last Supper and of the words used in the Latin text of the Roman Mass ; " for all " is rather " an explanation of the sort that belongs properly to catechesis .

WTP	1814	It clearly follows a precedent , but not an overwhelming one . 	0
WTP	1815	And the abortion article is very different in nature from other non-controversial surgeries . 	0
WTP	1816	So it ' s really up to consensus , although I think , regardless of how we decide , it will be a point that will be brought up and re-evaluated periodically , as is healthy in any article of this nature . 	0

WTP	1857	If we were to include all the information that Wassupwestcoast wants us to include about the abuse scandal in the article , we would violate WP : Undue Weight and WP : recentism . 	0

WTP	1862	The Congregation first recalled the 25 January 1974 declaration by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that " there is no doubt whatsoever " regarding the validity of Masses celebrated using " for all " as a translation of " pro multis " , since " for all " corresponds to a correct interpretation of Christ ' s intention expressed in the words of the consecration , and since it is a dogma of the Catholic faith that Christ died on the Cross for all ( cf .
