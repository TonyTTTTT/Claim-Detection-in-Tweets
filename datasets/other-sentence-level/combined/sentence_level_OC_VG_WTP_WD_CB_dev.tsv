ClaimBuster	0	I have ordered an investigation.	1
ClaimBuster	1	In the meantime, I think it's important to have what's called Immediate Helping Hand, which is direct money to states so that seniors, poor seniors, don't have to choose between food and medicine.	0
ClaimBuster	2	Because of paperwork and regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	3	I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country.	1
ClaimBuster	4	The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to -- I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea.	0
ClaimBuster	5	There's nothing the matter with that.	0
ClaimBuster	6	Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.	0
ClaimBuster	7	We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.	0
ClaimBuster	8	I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.	0
ClaimBuster	9	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	10	Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.	1
ClaimBuster	11	It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	12	I think we're going to have to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	13	And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	14	I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.	0
ClaimBuster	15	And I'm not going to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	16	I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	17	And I'm asking the American people to give me another opportunity and I'll rest on my record, but I'll also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first.	0
ClaimBuster	18	I'm proud that important military figures who are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday, General Eisenhower's son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; General Admiral William Crown; General Tony McBeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father -- all believe I would make a stronger commander in chief.	1
ClaimBuster	19	How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?	0
ClaimBuster	20	It now looks, because of steady negotiation, that we may have an agreement that will remove the Cubans from Angola.	0
ClaimBuster	21	And now they had ingenuity eight years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	22	There's been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	23	I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	24	I'll give you a couple of examples.	0
ClaimBuster	25	All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	26	And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car --	0
ClaimBuster	27	I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.	1
ClaimBuster	28	I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until we're safe.	1
ClaimBuster	29	We have a good, stable economic policy.	0
ClaimBuster	30	And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	31	This evening we talked about national strength.	1
ClaimBuster	32	If you're a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay.	1
ClaimBuster	33	I was -- broke with my party in 1985, one of the first three Democrats to fight for a balanced budget when it was heresy.	1
ClaimBuster	34	And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	35	This is uh - what the American people want.	0
ClaimBuster	36	The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.	0
ClaimBuster	37	If we don't trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the Social Security surplus, to grow from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it.	0
ClaimBuster	38	She's a fantastic lady I met in Charlotte, North Carolina.	1
ClaimBuster	39	You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result.	1
ClaimBuster	40	And I'm going to act responsibly, as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate.	0
ClaimBuster	41	Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	42	Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave.	0
ClaimBuster	43	Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee.	0
ClaimBuster	44	Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.	1
ClaimBuster	45	That is a very serious indictment of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	46	Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	47	We just have a different approach.	0
ClaimBuster	48	I congratulate him on -- on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaeda.	1
ClaimBuster	49	We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.	0
ClaimBuster	50	That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	51	But let me mention another thing.	0
ClaimBuster	52	The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors.	1
ClaimBuster	53	And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	54	If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.	0
ClaimBuster	55	Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	56	And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.	0
ClaimBuster	57	I want to invest in your family.	0
ClaimBuster	58	Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil.	0
ClaimBuster	59	That's just one tiny example.	0
ClaimBuster	60	You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then.	0
ClaimBuster	61	When you don't have any ideas, I guess you say the other person's ideas are old.	0
ClaimBuster	62	Now here is the contrast.	0
ClaimBuster	63	I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.	0
ClaimBuster	64	I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.	1
ClaimBuster	65	The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	66	I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	67	The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.	0
ClaimBuster	68	If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.	0
ClaimBuster	69	The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America.	1
ClaimBuster	70	We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.	1
ClaimBuster	71	We've got to move ahead with the strategic arms negotiation process, with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiations leading to conventional force reduction in Europe with deeper cuts on the Soviet side and Senator Bentsen and I will pursue that policy.	0
ClaimBuster	72	I don't think the surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	73	That happens to be a fact.	1
ClaimBuster	74	We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation.	0
ClaimBuster	75	I've met some of those people.	1
ClaimBuster	76	I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct.	0
ClaimBuster	77	Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	78	And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.	0
ClaimBuster	79	This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.	1
ClaimBuster	80	I was just going to -- --	0
ClaimBuster	81	We have to change this whole culture.	0
ClaimBuster	82	And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.	0
ClaimBuster	83	You can run, but you can't hide.	0
ClaimBuster	84	I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days.	0
ClaimBuster	85	A lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals.	0
ClaimBuster	86	The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.	1
ClaimBuster	87	That requires a cool hand at the tiller.	0
ClaimBuster	88	We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred - three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand.	1
ClaimBuster	89	The president's done nothing to try to fix it.	1
ClaimBuster	90	You know that I mean what I say.	0
ClaimBuster	91	But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.	0
ClaimBuster	92	I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.	0
ClaimBuster	93	I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase.	1
ClaimBuster	94	You have questioned my patriotism.	0
ClaimBuster	95	I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.	0
ClaimBuster	96	Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	97	So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	98	He is the leader of that country.	1
ClaimBuster	99	As an aid to enlistment.	0
ClaimBuster	100	There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.	0
ClaimBuster	101	And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.	0
ClaimBuster	102	And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.	0
ClaimBuster	103	The president relied on Afghan warlords and he outsourced that job too.	1
ClaimBuster	104	So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws.	1
ClaimBuster	105	When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.	1
ClaimBuster	106	An issue I have been involved in for many, many years and I'm proud of the work of the work that I've done there along with Senator Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	107	And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve.	1
ClaimBuster	108	It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened.	1
ClaimBuster	109	Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	110	But the federal government also can play a very important role.	0
ClaimBuster	111	And so, we've got a good military.	0
ClaimBuster	112	We have spent their money.	1
ClaimBuster	113	We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.	1
ClaimBuster	114	He tends to distort on a number of occasions.	0
ClaimBuster	115	Let's make our schools safe, let's make our neighborhoods safe.	0
ClaimBuster	116	You just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts.	1
ClaimBuster	117	You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	118	He's for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.	1
ClaimBuster	119	This is fact slinging -- a bill earlier this year.	0
ClaimBuster	120	These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.	0
ClaimBuster	121	And I believe when the average hour for many farmers' wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better.	0
ClaimBuster	122	We've got to rebuild our military.	0
ClaimBuster	123	Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there.	1
ClaimBuster	124	And affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color.	0
ClaimBuster	125	If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.	1
ClaimBuster	126	And talk about the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	127	The HMOs are against the patient's rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support, and that Gov.	1
ClaimBuster	128	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.	1
ClaimBuster	129	AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.	1
ClaimBuster	130	This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	131	You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.	1
ClaimBuster	132	There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	133	We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	0
ClaimBuster	134	Now, have I got that wrong?	0
ClaimBuster	135	And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut -- and that's who gets it -- long before we do, I'm going to invest in homeland security and I'm going to make sure we're not cutting COPS programs in America and we're fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants.	1
ClaimBuster	136	And that's really what this campaign is going to be about.	0
ClaimBuster	137	And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.	0
ClaimBuster	138	But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done.	0
ClaimBuster	139	I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.	1
ClaimBuster	140	Now, let me pose this question to America.	0
ClaimBuster	141	Just so you put it out.	0
ClaimBuster	142	Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	143	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.	0
ClaimBuster	144	That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.	0
ClaimBuster	145	I ask each of you just to look into your hearts, look into your guts.	0
ClaimBuster	146	Now, on arms control, we're completing 4 years.	1
ClaimBuster	147	I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was --	0
ClaimBuster	148	And that's saying something in that bunch.	0
ClaimBuster	149	He was hoping to turn a blind eye.	0
ClaimBuster	150	Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up.	0
ClaimBuster	151	Secondly, with respect to parental notification, I'm not going to require a 16-or 17-year-old kid who's been raped by her father and who's pregnant to have to notify her father.	0
ClaimBuster	152	"He said, ""I'll get back to you."""	1
ClaimBuster	153	I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.	0
ClaimBuster	154	We know nothing about them.	1
ClaimBuster	155	And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.	1
ClaimBuster	156	And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.	0
ClaimBuster	157	He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy.	1
ClaimBuster	158	And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	159	And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	160	And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.	0
ClaimBuster	161	Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America's strength.	0
ClaimBuster	162	And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.	1
ClaimBuster	163	These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	164	Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.	0
ClaimBuster	165	He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.	1
ClaimBuster	166	We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.	1
ClaimBuster	167	One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	168	And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term.	0
ClaimBuster	169	There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.	0
ClaimBuster	170	That's right at the top of my agenda.	0
ClaimBuster	171	"I remember going down to the basement of the White House the day we committed our troops as last resort, looking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, ""Do we have the right plan with the right troop level?"""	1
ClaimBuster	172	I support it and the Pescadores Island.	0
ClaimBuster	173	That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.	1
ClaimBuster	174	What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.	1
ClaimBuster	175	I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide.	0
ClaimBuster	176	It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.	0
ClaimBuster	177	And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.	0
ClaimBuster	178	They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	179	I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico.	1
ClaimBuster	180	"I think ""punish"" is the wrong word."	0
ClaimBuster	181	And some say that that's what Putin intended in the first place.	0
ClaimBuster	182	We're going to have a good economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	183	I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization.	0
ClaimBuster	184	You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	185	The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.	1
ClaimBuster	186	This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.	0
ClaimBuster	187	Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation.	0
ClaimBuster	188	But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is.	0
ClaimBuster	189	And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?	0
ClaimBuster	190	Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	191	But if I found somebody that had a conflict of interest that would try to illegally do something as a foreign -- registered lobby, the laws cover this.	1
ClaimBuster	192	It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.	0
ClaimBuster	193	And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.	0
ClaimBuster	194	I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work.	0
ClaimBuster	195	If we grow the economy it's going to help Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	196	You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	197	They surely don't let me do that.	0
ClaimBuster	198	I'm not satisfied when we are failing to develop the natural resources of the United States to the fullest.	0
ClaimBuster	199	And let me cite several examples.	0
ClaimBuster	200	But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns.	0
ClaimBuster	201	I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track.	1
ClaimBuster	202	When Mr. Nitze, a good negotiator, returned, he was rebuked, and his boss was fired.	1
ClaimBuster	203	(LAUGHTER) I said I'd do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform.	1
ClaimBuster	204	With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.	0
ClaimBuster	205	In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.	1
ClaimBuster	206	I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.	1
ClaimBuster	207	I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a driver's license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens.	0
ClaimBuster	208	We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.	1
ClaimBuster	209	And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.	0
ClaimBuster	210	But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people...	0
ClaimBuster	211	These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings.	1
ClaimBuster	212	I'm a guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	213	If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street.	0
ClaimBuster	214	Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise.	1
ClaimBuster	215	It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	216	And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.	0
ClaimBuster	217	And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.	0
ClaimBuster	218	That is not going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	219	And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	220	I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.	0
ClaimBuster	221	I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.	0
ClaimBuster	222	Well, we've just finished almost the whole debate.	0
ClaimBuster	223	You did everything you could to kill the Clean Water Act	1
ClaimBuster	224	I can -- and thanks, Washington U. as well.	0
ClaimBuster	225	I will just say my time is running out here.	0
ClaimBuster	226	And then we would have to start all over again.	0
ClaimBuster	227	You can't carry a gun into a school.	0
ClaimBuster	228	Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.	0
ClaimBuster	229	I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.	0
ClaimBuster	230	I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.	0
ClaimBuster	231	Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.	0
ClaimBuster	232	You can't worry about polls or focus groups.	0
ClaimBuster	233	That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.	0
ClaimBuster	234	But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	235	It was once called voodoo economics.	1
ClaimBuster	236	We can offshore drill now.	1
ClaimBuster	237	In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance.	1
ClaimBuster	238	That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.	0
ClaimBuster	239	We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.	0
ClaimBuster	240	We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.	0
ClaimBuster	241	Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others, knew how to lead.	0
ClaimBuster	242	And I have -- well, not quite that long.	0
ClaimBuster	243	And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven't done that.	1
ClaimBuster	244	You did, Ann heard of him.	0
ClaimBuster	245	I'm also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund.	1
ClaimBuster	246	Why, I had a great response to that.	1
ClaimBuster	247	Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.	1
ClaimBuster	248	Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year.	0
ClaimBuster	249	Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance.	0
ClaimBuster	250	And none of these things happened.	1
ClaimBuster	251	Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.	0
ClaimBuster	252	My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform.	1
ClaimBuster	253	All the people who may still be watching or viewing.	0
ClaimBuster	254	It's a very unstable situation.	0
ClaimBuster	255	This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	256	We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.	1
ClaimBuster	257	He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.	1
ClaimBuster	258	You can't tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started -- it was principally the United States, the America and Great Britain and one or two others.	0
ClaimBuster	259	After this year is over, we'll resolve it just as we did with Social Security in `83.	1
ClaimBuster	260	We should have our differences.	0
ClaimBuster	261	But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.	0
ClaimBuster	262	You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb?	0
ClaimBuster	263	We're going to have a new Congress, and we're going to say to them, you've listened to the voters the way we have.	0
ClaimBuster	264	That crime bill is going to be one of my highest priorities next January if I become president.	0
ClaimBuster	265	To those of you in the audience who are business people: pretty simple.	0
ClaimBuster	266	And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.	0
ClaimBuster	267	Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.	1
ClaimBuster	268	That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.	0
ClaimBuster	269	I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.	0
ClaimBuster	270	I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that.	0
ClaimBuster	271	I do think this, though.	0
ClaimBuster	272	I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there.	0
ClaimBuster	273	And we ought to try to meet the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	274	The President trusts the government.	0
ClaimBuster	275	It's very clear to me.	0
ClaimBuster	276	Well, it's cost-effective to help Russia succeed in its revolution; it's pennies on the dollar compared to going back to the Cold War.	1
ClaimBuster	277	Morale in today's military is too low.	0
ClaimBuster	278	Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.	1
ClaimBuster	279	The president just said the FBI had changed its culture.	0
ClaimBuster	280	I mean, this is a little defensive on your part, Susan, to be honest with you.	0
ClaimBuster	281	There is a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	282	But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration.	1
ClaimBuster	283	When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.	1
ClaimBuster	284	But I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way.	0
ClaimBuster	285	The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.	0
ClaimBuster	286	You know what she should have done?	0
ClaimBuster	287	Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something.	1
ClaimBuster	288	But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.	0
ClaimBuster	289	My favorite bumper sticker, though, is: Annoy the Media.	1
ClaimBuster	290	But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.	1
ClaimBuster	291	Yes, it'll create bubble jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	292	Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.	1
ClaimBuster	293	This is about, somebody said earlier, one of the first questions, we're together.	1
ClaimBuster	294	That's the kind of leadership I want to provide.	0
ClaimBuster	295	I found that was rather difficult to do.	0
ClaimBuster	296	Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.	0
ClaimBuster	297	And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.	1
ClaimBuster	298	Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would.	0
ClaimBuster	299	Government shouldn't be a heavy hand.	0
ClaimBuster	300	The man loves his family a lot, and I appreciate that, because I love my family.	1
ClaimBuster	301	You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract.	0
ClaimBuster	302	My point I have made already, Mr. President, with regard to negotiating: it does not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	303	I want us to invest in your future.	0
ClaimBuster	304	But it can't be dismissed that easily.	0
ClaimBuster	305	Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.	0
ClaimBuster	306	The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.	0
ClaimBuster	307	Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bush's plan, go to the wealthiest 1%.	1
ClaimBuster	308	We'd like to have your support.	0
ClaimBuster	309	If they can't get a loan, that means that they can't make payroll.	0
ClaimBuster	310	I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	311	So I will tell you this.	0
ClaimBuster	312	And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.	1
ClaimBuster	313	We cannot be the policemen of the world.	0
ClaimBuster	314	They see ethical problems in the Whitehouse today.	0
ClaimBuster	315	But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don't have that right.	1
ClaimBuster	316	We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children.	1
ClaimBuster	317	We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people.	1
ClaimBuster	318	Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	319	That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.	0
ClaimBuster	320	And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word.	1
ClaimBuster	321	Nobody has more respect for women than I do.	0
ClaimBuster	322	And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.	0
ClaimBuster	323	But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.	1
ClaimBuster	324	Mr. Bush says it's a hunky-dory deal.	1
ClaimBuster	325	Cocaine is up 141 percent -- marijuana, cocaine up 166 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	326	But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.	0
ClaimBuster	327	When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.	0
ClaimBuster	328	In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.	0
ClaimBuster	329	Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting.	0
ClaimBuster	330	I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have.	1
ClaimBuster	331	You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.	1
ClaimBuster	332	Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.	0
ClaimBuster	333	And I'll take care of them.	0
ClaimBuster	334	But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people.	0
ClaimBuster	335	I'd like to thank all the folks around America that no one ever knows about -- the woman that was holding the AIDS baby she adopted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa who asked me to do something more for adoption; the woman who stopped along the road in Wisconsin and wept because her husband had lost his job after 27 years; all the people who are having a tough time and the people who are winning but who know how desperately we need to change.	1
ClaimBuster	336	He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.	1
ClaimBuster	337	No, they were taunting us.	0
ClaimBuster	338	Senators and congressmen have a wide choice.	0
ClaimBuster	339	It basically protected states from the action of one state to another.	0
ClaimBuster	340	We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.	0
ClaimBuster	341	Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.	0
ClaimBuster	342	So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing...	0
ClaimBuster	343	"Reminds me of the line from the movie, ""Show me the money."""	0
ClaimBuster	344	I'm very proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	345	I don't think that's my job or my business.	0
ClaimBuster	346	For most of my time as governor a woman was my chief of staff.	1
ClaimBuster	347	We've worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill.	0
ClaimBuster	348	The State Department has said that.	1
ClaimBuster	349	I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.	0
ClaimBuster	350	There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.	1
ClaimBuster	351	... to be given any opportunities at all.	0
ClaimBuster	352	I want us to recapture that image.	0
ClaimBuster	353	That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses.	0
ClaimBuster	354	They will know whether we used those weapons or not.	0
ClaimBuster	355	And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.	0
ClaimBuster	356	Everybody knows it's hard work, because there's a determined enemy that's trying to defeat us.	0
ClaimBuster	357	I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	358	It holds down the prices of their goods.	1
ClaimBuster	359	I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.	0
ClaimBuster	360	I talked to the American Ambassador there.	1
ClaimBuster	361	The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.	0
ClaimBuster	362	Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.	0
ClaimBuster	363	And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.	1
ClaimBuster	364	I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	365	First thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be president.	0
ClaimBuster	366	I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training.	1
ClaimBuster	367	And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.	0
ClaimBuster	368	Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.	0
ClaimBuster	369	It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they're not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package.	0
ClaimBuster	370	We had to stand up against a tyrant.	0
ClaimBuster	371	But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	372	Both parties in Washington, the president and the Congress, have cut Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	373	We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn't work.	0
ClaimBuster	374	And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention.	1
ClaimBuster	375	And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along.	0
ClaimBuster	376	But I think in terms of the American people's concern about my commitment, I'm here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in.	0
ClaimBuster	377	He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say.	1
ClaimBuster	378	Again, a little bit of naivete there.	0
ClaimBuster	379	There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down.	1
ClaimBuster	380	And of course, a military action is the last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	381	"So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, ""Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. """	0
ClaimBuster	382	This is government by stalemate, and we've seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country.	0
ClaimBuster	383	We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.	0
ClaimBuster	384	On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years.	1
ClaimBuster	385	What I was referring to, of course, in the comment that you referred to was the situation in Lebanon.	0
ClaimBuster	386	50 million of you won't receive it.	1
ClaimBuster	387	We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.	0
ClaimBuster	388	Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.	0
ClaimBuster	389	And we knew where the fuel rods were.	1
ClaimBuster	390	Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	391	Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	392	The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs.	1
ClaimBuster	393	So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.	0
ClaimBuster	394	We offered an amendment to do so.	1
ClaimBuster	395	As president, I will make certain we travel it.	0
ClaimBuster	396	It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though.	0
ClaimBuster	397	I want to lower your cost to health care.	0
ClaimBuster	398	Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	399	It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	400	That's what the Duelfer report showed.	1
ClaimBuster	401	This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.	0
ClaimBuster	402	I don't think it's fair to say, you know, whatever it is, that if you haven't been hit by it personally.	0
ClaimBuster	403	That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	404	The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues.	0
ClaimBuster	405	Thirdly, in Bosnia it's a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election.	1
ClaimBuster	406	And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.	0
ClaimBuster	407	You can say you do to the cameras but you don't, unless you've changed your plan here on the stage.	0
ClaimBuster	408	I commend it to anybody.	0
ClaimBuster	409	In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.	1
ClaimBuster	410	It's important for the nuclear weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	411	I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels.	0
ClaimBuster	412	We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.	0
ClaimBuster	413	You can also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home.	1
ClaimBuster	414	If you're from Washington, you want to pick and choose winners.	0
ClaimBuster	415	But it's not going to solve the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	416	Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.	1
ClaimBuster	417	I see my time is running out here.	0
ClaimBuster	418	In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.	1
ClaimBuster	419	And I can't tell you what it means to me at these rallies when I see you and you come up and the look in your eyes -- and I know how you feel and you know how I feel.	0
ClaimBuster	420	The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.	1
ClaimBuster	421	We uh - streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh - severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity.	0
ClaimBuster	422	And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	423	And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	424	And the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America.	0
ClaimBuster	425	You were very much involved -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	426	How would he feel about it?	0
ClaimBuster	427	I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	428	Well, we're going to be finished by 2014, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.	0
ClaimBuster	429	I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools.	0
ClaimBuster	430	Will you finally touch that defense budget?	0
ClaimBuster	431	I have a plan to cover all children.	0
ClaimBuster	432	We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.	1
ClaimBuster	433	Most small businesses -- 70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	434	Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes.	1
ClaimBuster	435	But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons.	0
ClaimBuster	436	We'll pass on the American dream to our children, and I will not leave our children a situation that they have today.	0
ClaimBuster	437	In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal I've set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	438	I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January.	1
ClaimBuster	439	But I think even more relevant is my record at home.	0
ClaimBuster	440	That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.	1
ClaimBuster	441	I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.	0
ClaimBuster	442	But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.	0
ClaimBuster	443	And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent -- I believe -- is the number.	1
ClaimBuster	444	And these old boys are not going to quit easy.	0
ClaimBuster	445	The issue of nationalism - the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere - that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states' rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis.	1
ClaimBuster	446	And as I just told you, there's going to be a summit of the Arab nations.	1
ClaimBuster	447	They're created in the private sector.	1
ClaimBuster	448	And the way I pay for it -- I'm not fiscally irresponsible -- is I roll back the tax cut this president so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie.	1
ClaimBuster	449	Andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means?	0
ClaimBuster	450	"I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, ""See the house over?"	1
ClaimBuster	451	You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.	0
ClaimBuster	452	And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.	0
ClaimBuster	453	And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.	1
ClaimBuster	454	I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back.	1
ClaimBuster	455	Go home and look in the mirror.	0
ClaimBuster	456	I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue.	0
ClaimBuster	457	We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.	0
ClaimBuster	458	And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.	0
ClaimBuster	459	They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.	0
ClaimBuster	460	Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them.	0
ClaimBuster	461	I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version.	0
ClaimBuster	462	I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.	0
ClaimBuster	463	You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense.	0
ClaimBuster	464	And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations.	1
ClaimBuster	465	We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.	0
ClaimBuster	466	I have a fearless forecast.	0
ClaimBuster	467	And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession.	1
ClaimBuster	468	The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent.	0
ClaimBuster	469	If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.	0
ClaimBuster	470	I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.	1
ClaimBuster	471	I don't think we need them to remain strong.	0
ClaimBuster	472	It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.	0
ClaimBuster	473	This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	474	But you know, Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, he's had roughly the same amount of experience.	1
ClaimBuster	475	"If the president had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders, say, ""What do you need, what do you need now, how much more will it take to get you to join us?"""	0
ClaimBuster	476	We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.	0
ClaimBuster	477	You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	478	The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	479	Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	480	I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.	1
ClaimBuster	481	If we fail, then freedom fails.	0
ClaimBuster	482	But I think this is indicative of what I would do.	0
ClaimBuster	483	I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	484	I'll tell you what kind of judges he'll put on.	0
ClaimBuster	485	And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East.	1
ClaimBuster	486	But 11 million new jobs and everything, I mean the President can't take credit for everything that governors are doing, whether that's happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether it's drug use or something else in America.	0
ClaimBuster	487	This is not enough; it should be more.	0
ClaimBuster	488	The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island.	1
ClaimBuster	489	And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.	0
ClaimBuster	490	We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	491	I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	492	But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.	0
ClaimBuster	493	That's another way to improve the environment.	0
ClaimBuster	494	I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.	0
ClaimBuster	495	It's the private sector that creates jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	496	You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.	0
ClaimBuster	497	I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.	0
ClaimBuster	498	And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it.	0
ClaimBuster	499	We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on.	1
ClaimBuster	500	And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now.	0
ClaimBuster	501	His whole deal is you've gotta be for it or against it, you can't make it better.	0
ClaimBuster	502	But I don't know Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	503	The role of government: Look behind us.	0
ClaimBuster	504	$89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs.	1
ClaimBuster	505	And so we said: Let's raise the standards.	1
ClaimBuster	506	Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing, but to the ordinary American out there who doesn't know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they're near the border.	1
ClaimBuster	507	Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.	1
ClaimBuster	508	But I went anyway because I knew if I didn't, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place.	0
ClaimBuster	509	They should have been doing this for years.	0
ClaimBuster	510	Well, it's in this committee or it's got this sponsor.	0
ClaimBuster	511	Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.	1
ClaimBuster	512	And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children.	1
ClaimBuster	513	And again I know Senator D'Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can't remember, but he's not my general chairman, he's a friend of mine.	1
ClaimBuster	514	I've broken up organized crime.	1
ClaimBuster	515	I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does.	1
ClaimBuster	516	We will commit more over time to help.	0
ClaimBuster	517	Why don't you interrupt her?	0
ClaimBuster	518	We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.	1
ClaimBuster	519	I believe that choice is a woman's choice.	0
ClaimBuster	520	But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	521	If we make the use of a gun in the commission.	0
ClaimBuster	522	I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.	0
ClaimBuster	523	I think it's very difficult.	0
ClaimBuster	524	And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.	1
ClaimBuster	525	It shouldn't happen in America.	0
ClaimBuster	526	We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent.	0
ClaimBuster	527	And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors.	1
ClaimBuster	528	For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.	1
ClaimBuster	529	When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.	0
ClaimBuster	530	And I think this is something the American people see.	0
ClaimBuster	531	We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.	0
ClaimBuster	532	The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.	1
ClaimBuster	533	And we've got a good strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	534	And I believe that we used our skill.	0
ClaimBuster	535	The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we're number one in auto production again.	1
ClaimBuster	536	And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	537	But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.	0
ClaimBuster	538	I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another.	1
ClaimBuster	539	He has consistently denied what is...	1
ClaimBuster	540	Our policemen and women are disrespected.	0
ClaimBuster	541	I think of Dr. Fauci.	0
ClaimBuster	542	Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was -- failed, and that the Byrd family, among others, asked you to support it, Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support.	0
ClaimBuster	543	"I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, ""Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech."	1
ClaimBuster	544	Senator McCain and I actually agree on something.	1
ClaimBuster	545	You can keep your choice of doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	546	It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.	0
ClaimBuster	547	How's it going to affect my house?	0
ClaimBuster	548	In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.	0
ClaimBuster	549	Obamacare is a total disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	550	So this is who Donald Trump is.	0
ClaimBuster	551	I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us.	0
ClaimBuster	552	I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.	1
ClaimBuster	553	And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.	0
ClaimBuster	554	They have to understand we want to trade with them.	0
ClaimBuster	555	And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.	0
ClaimBuster	556	Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient.	1
ClaimBuster	557	Iraq was Iran's mortal enemy.	1
ClaimBuster	558	And in this election, America has to make an important choice.	1
ClaimBuster	559	But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.	0
ClaimBuster	560	I think that it's been very well...	0
ClaimBuster	561	But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.	1
ClaimBuster	562	So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support.	0
ClaimBuster	563	We need to do more.	0
ClaimBuster	564	And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.	0
ClaimBuster	565	My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.	1
ClaimBuster	566	Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.	0
ClaimBuster	567	Remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have a contact with somebody who was in Vietnam?	0
ClaimBuster	568	It's because they have lost their industry.	0
ClaimBuster	569	It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.	1
ClaimBuster	570	You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.	1
ClaimBuster	571	And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	572	And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.	1
ClaimBuster	573	My father was a small-businessman.	1
ClaimBuster	574	And if they don't do it, we're gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising.	0
ClaimBuster	575	I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?	0
ClaimBuster	576	We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation, and they waited three and a half years.	1
ClaimBuster	577	"""I think that makes sense."	0
ClaimBuster	578	And that's, like, no growth.	0
ClaimBuster	579	For the last eight years I've served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II.	1
ClaimBuster	580	What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts?	0
ClaimBuster	581	And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions.	0
ClaimBuster	582	And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.	0
ClaimBuster	583	We're getting ready to dismantle the airlines industry in our country, and none of you know it.	1
ClaimBuster	584	She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	585	If there's more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, I'm the wrong man.	0
ClaimBuster	586	I don't go along with it.	0
ClaimBuster	587	And if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board.	0
ClaimBuster	588	The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism.	0
ClaimBuster	589	Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America?	0
ClaimBuster	590	Sorry, time for diplomacy is over.	0
ClaimBuster	591	Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.	1
ClaimBuster	592	As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.	1
ClaimBuster	593	And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.	1
ClaimBuster	594	We want a world that's stable.	0
ClaimBuster	595	The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	596	But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.	0
ClaimBuster	597	What has happened to you?	0
ClaimBuster	598	We initiated a very fine urban renewal program, working with the mayors, the governors, and other interested officials.	0
ClaimBuster	599	It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.	0
ClaimBuster	600	Spain is a NATO ally.	1
ClaimBuster	601	That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.	0
ClaimBuster	602	Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily.	0
ClaimBuster	603	But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future.	0
ClaimBuster	604	Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the president than to say if you believe in the constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, that's all we need to know.	0
ClaimBuster	605	And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.	1
ClaimBuster	606	They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months.	0
ClaimBuster	607	So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past.	0
ClaimBuster	608	He made it illegal, illegal for Medicare to do what the V.A.	1
ClaimBuster	609	I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust a Lackawanna cell up there.	0
ClaimBuster	610	But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	611	We both believe that, as lawyers -- I'm a lawyer, too.	0
ClaimBuster	612	And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.	1
ClaimBuster	613	We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.	0
ClaimBuster	614	And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight.	0
ClaimBuster	615	One is to reduce spending -- controlling that mandatory spending.	0
ClaimBuster	616	Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan.	0
ClaimBuster	617	Senator Obama's name was not on that letter.	1
ClaimBuster	618	We do have a serious problem in our culture.	0
ClaimBuster	619	I talk to small businesses across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	620	So far, Mr. Ford has not responded.	1
ClaimBuster	621	But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.	0
ClaimBuster	622	I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.	0
ClaimBuster	623	We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.	0
ClaimBuster	624	I know one thing about the position of president, it's the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way.	0
ClaimBuster	625	This is a formidable force.	0
ClaimBuster	626	We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.	1
ClaimBuster	627	"'', he said, ""Cut those things I asked for but didn't get.''"	1
ClaimBuster	628	See, an educated child is one much more likely to be hopeful and optimistic.	0
ClaimBuster	629	President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.	1
ClaimBuster	630	I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say I'm happy to be here with Tipper and our family.	0
ClaimBuster	631	I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.	0
ClaimBuster	632	I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.	1
ClaimBuster	633	Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.	0
ClaimBuster	634	The plan says we'll train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are.	1
ClaimBuster	635	And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how.	0
ClaimBuster	636	Thank you for doing what you're doing.	0
ClaimBuster	637	I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.	1
ClaimBuster	638	But one mistake he's made is fuel efficiency standards at 40 to 45 miles a gallon will throw many auto workers out of work, and you can't have it both ways.	1
ClaimBuster	639	This is another example of misplaced priorities.	0
ClaimBuster	640	And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.	1
ClaimBuster	641	Number two, trade -- I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't.	1
ClaimBuster	642	But you were in contact -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	643	Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself.	0
ClaimBuster	644	I'm optimistic we'll achieve -- I know we won't achieve if we send mixed signals.	0
ClaimBuster	645	And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect.	0
ClaimBuster	646	Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?	0
ClaimBuster	647	That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.	0
ClaimBuster	648	We have to be firm and strong.	0
ClaimBuster	649	Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	650	No, it doesn't speak for itself, Mr. Vice President, it speaks for the fact that there are certain rules in this that we all agree to, but evidently rules don't mean anything.	0
ClaimBuster	651	Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess.	0
ClaimBuster	652	Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they're severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals.	0
ClaimBuster	653	I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries.	0
ClaimBuster	654	You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	655	I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	656	I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.	0
ClaimBuster	657	Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent.	1
ClaimBuster	658	We'll continue to build our alliances.	0
ClaimBuster	659	So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.	1
ClaimBuster	660	Well, you know, let me just...	0
ClaimBuster	661	He's trying to attack me.	1
ClaimBuster	662	That has the benefit of making sure our employers aren't breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs.	0
ClaimBuster	663	We've got to invest in science and technology.	0
ClaimBuster	664	The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.	1
ClaimBuster	665	So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.	0
ClaimBuster	666	It is the best anti-terrorist report written.	0
ClaimBuster	667	We have serious differences with the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	668	And that's not how a commander in chief acts.	0
ClaimBuster	669	And I supported this bill.	1
ClaimBuster	670	Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand.	0
ClaimBuster	671	They're tough negotiators, but all previous Presidents have made progress.	1
ClaimBuster	672	And looking around here, at this group here, I suspect there are only three people here who are going to be affected: the president, me, and, Charlie, I'm sorry, you too.	0
ClaimBuster	673	He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	674	Did you ask me a question?	0
ClaimBuster	675	Can I respond to that?	0
ClaimBuster	676	I will bring our energy companies back.	0
ClaimBuster	677	But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice.	0
ClaimBuster	678	The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina.	1
ClaimBuster	679	Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	680	They investigated every single one of my children.	1
ClaimBuster	681	Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	682	But I'm confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.	1
ClaimBuster	683	And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.	0
ClaimBuster	684	If people don't have the stomach to fix these problems, I think it's a good time to face it, November.	0
ClaimBuster	685	The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.	0
ClaimBuster	686	I can't think of any.	0
ClaimBuster	687	So how do we deal with it?	0
ClaimBuster	688	I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college.	0
ClaimBuster	689	The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred.	0
ClaimBuster	690	One of the things that happens when you're a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	691	And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.	1
ClaimBuster	692	Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America.	0
ClaimBuster	693	And it's referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted.	1
ClaimBuster	694	We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America.	0
ClaimBuster	695	We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.	1
ClaimBuster	696	I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.	0
ClaimBuster	697	Humvees -- 10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there aren't armored.	1
ClaimBuster	698	In other states, we've done it.	1
ClaimBuster	699	We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	700	The -- I haven't seen that, in my commercials?	0
ClaimBuster	701	I don't think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights.	0
ClaimBuster	702	That's why we doubled clean -- clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.	1
ClaimBuster	703	How many of you like it?	0
ClaimBuster	704	Some people say that's a hatchet.	0
ClaimBuster	705	You know, my hardest -- the hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harm's way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband or wife.	1
ClaimBuster	706	You see, I don't think we need to tax more and spend more, and then say that's going to make the problem better.	0
ClaimBuster	707	As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement.	1
ClaimBuster	708	It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.	1
ClaimBuster	709	"And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, ""I'm not running to be a Catholic president."	1
ClaimBuster	710	Here a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry.	1
ClaimBuster	711	But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, I'll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures.	0
ClaimBuster	712	And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the '82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history.	1
ClaimBuster	713	But we know we've got lots of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	714	We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there.	1
ClaimBuster	715	But let's not cut into the muscle, and let's not cut down our insurance policy, which is participation of American forces in NATO, the greatest peace- keeping organization ever made.	1
ClaimBuster	716	So I would think we can expedite the problem there.	0
ClaimBuster	717	It's now over $10 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	718	And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.	0
ClaimBuster	719	The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security.	0
ClaimBuster	720	And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college.	0
ClaimBuster	721	And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.	0
ClaimBuster	722	Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.	0
ClaimBuster	723	We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves.	1
ClaimBuster	724	And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.	0
ClaimBuster	725	The President didn't have much to do about it.	0
ClaimBuster	726	But here's what I do know.	0
ClaimBuster	727	Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.	1
ClaimBuster	728	The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.	1
ClaimBuster	729	They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong?	0
ClaimBuster	730	That's not the position he's taking.	1
ClaimBuster	731	There's a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections.	1
ClaimBuster	732	We've looked at your tax proposals.	0
ClaimBuster	733	All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.	0
ClaimBuster	734	You keep your own insurance.	0
ClaimBuster	735	And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	736	They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	737	I'm not going to ask them.	0
ClaimBuster	738	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.	1
ClaimBuster	739	You don't see Margaret Tutwiler sitting in there with me today.	1
ClaimBuster	740	Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	741	And women have respect for me.	0
ClaimBuster	742	I have a great company.	0
ClaimBuster	743	We - uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years.	1
ClaimBuster	744	We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.	0
ClaimBuster	745	I believe that public service is honorable.	0
ClaimBuster	746	He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School.	1
ClaimBuster	747	They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.	0
ClaimBuster	748	And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	749	It's about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas.	1
ClaimBuster	750	"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."	0
ClaimBuster	751	That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	752	Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann.	0
ClaimBuster	753	I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	754	Well, I certainly hope not.	0
ClaimBuster	755	And we're going to put our laboratories and our colleges and our universities to work.	0
ClaimBuster	756	We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.	0
ClaimBuster	757	And yet the president who talks about No Child Left Behind refused to fully fund -- by $28 billion -- that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people.	1
ClaimBuster	758	And I've done everything I could in my public life to overcome racial divisions.	0
ClaimBuster	759	They've taken over the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	760	"And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagan's ""trust, but verify,"" and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, it's just dangerous."	1
ClaimBuster	761	... withdrawal would be dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	762	Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.	0
ClaimBuster	763	That's what I'm all about.	0
ClaimBuster	764	Now here's what we need to do.	0
ClaimBuster	765	I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.	0
ClaimBuster	766	And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.	0
ClaimBuster	767	Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?	0
ClaimBuster	768	Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	769	I believe America's best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.	0
ClaimBuster	770	This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.	1
ClaimBuster	771	But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	772	I believe in free trade.	0
ClaimBuster	773	I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	774	This is a difficult and sensitive matter.	0
ClaimBuster	775	There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been wrong on a number of the major ones.	1
ClaimBuster	776	It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	777	And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.	0
ClaimBuster	778	We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.	1
ClaimBuster	779	And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.	1
ClaimBuster	780	And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance.	0
ClaimBuster	781	In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously.	1
ClaimBuster	782	Well, a lot of what this campaign is about, it seems to me Bernie, goes to the question of values.	0
ClaimBuster	783	When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.	0
ClaimBuster	784	Jim, thank you very much.	0
ClaimBuster	785	Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.	0
ClaimBuster	786	He has all the conspiracy theories...	0
ClaimBuster	787	People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed.	0
ClaimBuster	788	I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input.	1
ClaimBuster	789	"But to somehow say that group of young women who said ""Military wives for McCain"" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens."	0
ClaimBuster	790	Whether that helps or not, I don't know.	0
ClaimBuster	791	Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	792	But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.	0
ClaimBuster	793	And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.	1
ClaimBuster	794	You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.	1
ClaimBuster	795	And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think?	0
ClaimBuster	796	High tech executives in Northern California.	1
ClaimBuster	797	See, there's a lot I don't understand.	0
ClaimBuster	798	I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.	1
ClaimBuster	799	But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.	0
ClaimBuster	800	So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough.	0
ClaimBuster	801	And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.	0
ClaimBuster	802	There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed.	0
ClaimBuster	803	I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.	0
ClaimBuster	804	But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever.	1
ClaimBuster	805	"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''"	0
ClaimBuster	806	But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.	1
ClaimBuster	807	"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true."	1
ClaimBuster	808	And if he should ever become uh - the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	809	We have to double the size of the Afghan army.	0
ClaimBuster	810	In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and we've set high standards in the executive branch of the government.	0
ClaimBuster	811	A promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to become your president.	0
ClaimBuster	812	And if you watch it Thursday, Friday, Saturday this week, you'll get more.	0
ClaimBuster	813	"His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, ""We're going to encourage self-deportation."""	1
ClaimBuster	814	You know, here's what I would say.	0
ClaimBuster	815	All right, here we go again.	0
ClaimBuster	816	Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.	0
ClaimBuster	817	Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?	0
ClaimBuster	818	They don't reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	819	This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.	1
ClaimBuster	820	Mine are words, and his was action.	0
ClaimBuster	821	In addition to that, the build-up of military forces is good for our country because we've got to have military strength to preserve the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	822	We were there for the better part of a year.	1
ClaimBuster	823	OK. We need to create jobs here.	0
ClaimBuster	824	This president chose a tax cut over homeland security.	1
ClaimBuster	825	We had a good neighbor policy, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	826	But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.	1
ClaimBuster	827	There are plenty of places to cut.	0
ClaimBuster	828	The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	829	Well, let me just say I would...	0
ClaimBuster	830	And my plan say why don't we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills?	0
ClaimBuster	831	They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	832	But we can't just provide moral support.	0
ClaimBuster	833	So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student.	0
ClaimBuster	834	When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.	1
ClaimBuster	835	But that's not what I believe.	0
ClaimBuster	836	But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.	0
ClaimBuster	837	I believe we can do it.	0
ClaimBuster	838	The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	839	I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.	0
ClaimBuster	840	We've seen in the Nicaraguan example a policy that has actually hurt us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our country in that region.	0
ClaimBuster	841	Actually, Mr. President, in 1997 we fixed Medicare, and I was one of the people involved in it.	1
ClaimBuster	842	But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	843	I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America.	1
ClaimBuster	844	It's not driven by politics.	1
ClaimBuster	845	We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	846	The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	847	I believe in opening doors.	0
ClaimBuster	848	There isn't one country in the Middle East that now endorses the Eisenhower Doctrine.	1
ClaimBuster	849	There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.	0
ClaimBuster	850	In fact, I'm for shrinking the size of government.	1
ClaimBuster	851	If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.	0
ClaimBuster	852	We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.	1
ClaimBuster	853	The farm income in America is high.	1
ClaimBuster	854	But we also have to take demand seriously.	0
ClaimBuster	855	These appointments are for life.	1
ClaimBuster	856	I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.	0
ClaimBuster	857	I want to finally get something done on Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	858	Let me get out of your way here.	0
ClaimBuster	859	The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.	1
ClaimBuster	860	Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking -- taking care of business here at home.	0
ClaimBuster	861	I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.	0
ClaimBuster	862	You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	863	But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	864	You can have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated.	1
ClaimBuster	865	I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.	0
ClaimBuster	866	I don't think he was misleading.	0
ClaimBuster	867	Well, we have come to that position.	0
ClaimBuster	868	But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that that so-called simple amendment would be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against things that would be physically harmful to them.	0
ClaimBuster	869	But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	870	So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.	1
ClaimBuster	871	I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.	1
ClaimBuster	872	You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?	0
ClaimBuster	873	I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	874	And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	875	Those are the people who ought to be in jail.	0
ClaimBuster	876	It's a good package, Mr. President.	0
ClaimBuster	877	Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin.	1
ClaimBuster	878	You'll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question.	0
ClaimBuster	879	And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?	0
ClaimBuster	880	I was able for two years when I was in, a very young boy to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life.	1
ClaimBuster	881	I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.	1
ClaimBuster	882	I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another.	0
ClaimBuster	883	more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.	1
ClaimBuster	884	That's because it comes at you, not from you.	0
ClaimBuster	885	And I wish we had time to let me explain.	0
ClaimBuster	886	And his emissary, I think, came home in 12 hours having heard a very definite nyet.	0
ClaimBuster	887	This is what this election is all about.	0
ClaimBuster	888	Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief who clearly sets the mission.	0
ClaimBuster	889	It says, for example, that a woman doesn't have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist.	1
ClaimBuster	890	Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	891	We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.	0
ClaimBuster	892	But the president made a mistake in invading Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	893	Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.	1
ClaimBuster	894	And as a consequence, Al Qaeda's core leadership has been decimated.	1
ClaimBuster	895	You know, we are at a defining moment in our history.	0
ClaimBuster	896	But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success.	0
ClaimBuster	897	We've got ten and a half million new jobs; we've got record numbers of those new small businesses.	1
ClaimBuster	898	I think what really matters is what we can do to build strong families.	0
ClaimBuster	899	So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief - would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?	0
ClaimBuster	900	And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.	0
ClaimBuster	901	Somebody went to a woman and nearly killed her.	1
ClaimBuster	902	I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	903	I've been able to set clear goals.	0
ClaimBuster	904	We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.	0
ClaimBuster	905	You know what that is?	0
ClaimBuster	906	Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	907	But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.	0
ClaimBuster	908	So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.	0
ClaimBuster	909	Look at the Republicans that have endorsed me.	0
ClaimBuster	910	The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs.	0
ClaimBuster	911	You're doing a great job, Tom.	0
ClaimBuster	912	We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	913	I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.	0
ClaimBuster	914	Governor Carter again contradicts himself.	0
ClaimBuster	915	Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.	1
ClaimBuster	916	Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.	1
ClaimBuster	917	And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, just besides us.	0
ClaimBuster	918	We need to go after the leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	919	That is a rank mischaracterization.	0
ClaimBuster	920	We had Saddam Hussein trapped.	1
ClaimBuster	921	We've got to invest in college affordability.	0
ClaimBuster	922	You judge on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	923	It must -- as a last resort.	0
ClaimBuster	924	I just want to get back to this home ownership.	0
ClaimBuster	925	I didn't care whether he was a Republican or Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	926	And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.	0
ClaimBuster	927	So, this has been my feeling about abortion, that we have a problem now to determine -- and all the evidence so far comes down on the side of the unborn child being a living human being.	0
ClaimBuster	928	I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.	0
ClaimBuster	929	Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	930	And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponent's plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically.	1
ClaimBuster	931	But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	932	My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.	1
ClaimBuster	933	American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	934	I'll get our incomes up.	0
ClaimBuster	935	The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot.	0
ClaimBuster	936	In the rest of the world, the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way.	0
ClaimBuster	937	And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction.	0
ClaimBuster	938	People are stopped, and we have to do something about that.	0
ClaimBuster	939	We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.	0
ClaimBuster	940	We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.	0
ClaimBuster	941	There's no question about that.	0
ClaimBuster	942	Hiring people temporarily who have lost their jobs and they get to work for 30 days or 60 days.	1
ClaimBuster	943	Let's go back to the tax and budget summit briefly.	0
ClaimBuster	944	That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?	0
ClaimBuster	945	And we're asking to be able to allow you to get them.	0
ClaimBuster	946	The world -- let me tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	947	If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.	0
ClaimBuster	948	It's obvious that there are certain things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people.	0
ClaimBuster	949	And there are two very different paths the country can take.	0
ClaimBuster	950	And sadly, she doesn't have that.	0
ClaimBuster	951	"I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called ""The New War,"" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network."	1
ClaimBuster	952	I hope they're not awful things.	0
ClaimBuster	953	She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	954	Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending.	0
ClaimBuster	955	And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	956	I was able to do that in my state and bring these two together.	0
ClaimBuster	957	And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.	0
ClaimBuster	958	That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.	1
ClaimBuster	959	That's what President Clinton did.	1
ClaimBuster	960	In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.	0
ClaimBuster	961	It's now four years later.	1
ClaimBuster	962	Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.	0
ClaimBuster	963	In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.	1
ClaimBuster	964	There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	965	On Social Security he's not.	0
ClaimBuster	966	That wasn't going to work.	0
ClaimBuster	967	I said I'm opposed to discrimination.	1
ClaimBuster	968	And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.	1
ClaimBuster	969	And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields don't want to do so for fear of lawsuit.	0
ClaimBuster	970	And that's why we're doing what he suggested we do: Get the Brits, the Germans and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world to give up their nuclear ambitions.	0
ClaimBuster	971	I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do.	0
ClaimBuster	972	This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.	0
ClaimBuster	973	That's why I think I'll win.	0
ClaimBuster	974	And everything in there says what I am for.	0
ClaimBuster	975	My opponent says he hadn't changed his position on it.	1
ClaimBuster	976	That's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate.	0
ClaimBuster	977	It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.	1
ClaimBuster	978	But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	979	He had two terms in the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	980	And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.	0
ClaimBuster	981	We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.	1
ClaimBuster	982	President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.	1
ClaimBuster	983	But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile.	1
ClaimBuster	984	Why did our government do it?	0
ClaimBuster	985	But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.	0
ClaimBuster	986	If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.	1
ClaimBuster	987	It's my - my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	988	Now, that's a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.	0
ClaimBuster	989	I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	990	And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.	1
ClaimBuster	991	I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today.	0
ClaimBuster	992	I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of what's called global warming.	0
ClaimBuster	993	Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder.	1
ClaimBuster	994	He is the chairman of the health committee.	1
ClaimBuster	995	And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we don't have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.	1
ClaimBuster	996	We can get this economy going again.	0
ClaimBuster	997	And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.	0
ClaimBuster	998	If you're a Medicare person, on Medicare, you don't get the new procedures.	1
ClaimBuster	999	Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either.	1
ClaimBuster	1000	Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1001	His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.	1
ClaimBuster	1002	First of all, most of good governance is at the state level.	0
ClaimBuster	1003	The Russians can't believe it.	0
ClaimBuster	1004	We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.	1
ClaimBuster	1005	And in some cases may be still at large.	0
ClaimBuster	1006	The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind.	0
ClaimBuster	1007	Twenty percent of the upper-income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts.	1
ClaimBuster	1008	Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	1009	We have cut inflation by better than half.	1
ClaimBuster	1010	I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.	1
ClaimBuster	1011	That was in an ad, Jim, that was knocked down by the journalists who analyzed the ad and said it was misleading.	1
ClaimBuster	1012	I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on.	1
ClaimBuster	1013	If we got along well, that would be good.	0
ClaimBuster	1014	The president -- and this is one of the reasons why I am very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the president's father and did a brilliant job, supporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovo, supporting me; because they all -- and General Baca, who was the head of the National Guard, supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	1015	I don't dislike trial lawyers.	0
ClaimBuster	1016	The president broke the pay-as-you-go rule.	1
ClaimBuster	1017	It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth.	1
ClaimBuster	1018	The Soviets try to spy on us, steal this stuff.	1
ClaimBuster	1019	As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.	1
ClaimBuster	1020	Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	1021	Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1022	That happened long before I arrived in Washington, D.C.	1
ClaimBuster	1023	We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.	1
ClaimBuster	1024	Many of her friends took bigger deductions.	1
ClaimBuster	1025	We can have health care for all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1026	Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.	1
ClaimBuster	1027	So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no.	0
ClaimBuster	1028	Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right.	0
ClaimBuster	1029	This is a great country.	0
ClaimBuster	1030	The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what we're doing.	1
ClaimBuster	1031	You can't be on one hand this way and one hand another.	0
ClaimBuster	1032	There's a -- no, look, there's a systemic problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1033	But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues -- trying to be one thing to one person here that's opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it -- what we call waffling.	1
ClaimBuster	1034	And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.	0
ClaimBuster	1035	... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.	1
ClaimBuster	1036	He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side saying that I did the wrong thing.	1
ClaimBuster	1037	In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I don't want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard: he started it.	0
ClaimBuster	1038	And I will stand up for that right.	0
ClaimBuster	1039	Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1040	And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we don't care and we're going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd.	1
ClaimBuster	1041	We passed a bill in 1992 that encouraged the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking.	1
ClaimBuster	1042	So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.	0
ClaimBuster	1043	And that's why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis.	1
ClaimBuster	1044	With the United States, as he said, not so much.	1
ClaimBuster	1045	Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.	0
ClaimBuster	1046	I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1047	We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.	0
ClaimBuster	1048	Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat.	0
ClaimBuster	1049	Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.	1
ClaimBuster	1050	And I do think that you can't turn the White House into the Waffle House.	0
ClaimBuster	1051	I've voted eight, ten times since 1965.	1
ClaimBuster	1052	The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	1053	I didn't favor it when it was in, started.	0
ClaimBuster	1054	Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described.	1
ClaimBuster	1055	And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates?	0
ClaimBuster	1056	We live-we bring everybody along.	0
ClaimBuster	1057	I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.	1
ClaimBuster	1058	Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	1059	But we have an opportunity -- we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal.	1
ClaimBuster	1060	As regarding Mr. Perot, I take back something I said about him.	0
ClaimBuster	1061	Well, it is an open discussion.	0
ClaimBuster	1062	We've done about all, we are the reform party, the Republican Party.	0
ClaimBuster	1063	The governors -- and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this -- but maybe -- I don't want to invoke him here.	0
ClaimBuster	1064	But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.	1
ClaimBuster	1065	Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine and that the world is better for it.	0
ClaimBuster	1066	We have to help these nations create civil societies.	0
ClaimBuster	1067	You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.	0
ClaimBuster	1068	It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.	0
ClaimBuster	1069	I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money.	0
ClaimBuster	1070	Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1071	... or at an airport near you.	0
ClaimBuster	1072	We're the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other.	0
ClaimBuster	1073	That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	1074	Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.	0
ClaimBuster	1075	It was killed in the Rules Committee.	1
ClaimBuster	1076	In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Senator McCain's campaign over the last two or three weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	1077	And the president should lead a national effort to change behavior, to keep our children alive in the schools, responsible behavior to keep people alive.	0
ClaimBuster	1078	In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.	0
ClaimBuster	1079	I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and I'm sorry about that.	1
ClaimBuster	1080	Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion.	0
ClaimBuster	1081	But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case.	0
ClaimBuster	1082	I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though.	0
ClaimBuster	1083	It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles.	0
ClaimBuster	1084	Thank you, and good night.	0
ClaimBuster	1085	As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981.	1
ClaimBuster	1086	Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal.	1
ClaimBuster	1087	I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents.	0
ClaimBuster	1088	And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1089	I went to Washington to solve problems.	1
ClaimBuster	1090	And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --	0
ClaimBuster	1091	We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	1092	And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile.	1
ClaimBuster	1093	For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.	0
ClaimBuster	1094	And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	1095	I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Ã‚ $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	1096	And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.	0
ClaimBuster	1097	Spending was only up something like 4 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1098	And now we hear a lot of talk, oh, well, we all want enterprise zones, and yet the House and the Senate can't send it down without loading it up with a lot of, you know, these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation.	0
ClaimBuster	1099	I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford.	0
ClaimBuster	1100	"But in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure -- states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. """	0
ClaimBuster	1101	It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?	0
ClaimBuster	1102	They can't live in the community which they grew up in.	0
ClaimBuster	1103	So, I don't want to fool around with it.	0
ClaimBuster	1104	"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice."""	1
ClaimBuster	1105	Let me say at the outset, uh - I'm very proud of the record of this administration.	0
ClaimBuster	1106	I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.	0
ClaimBuster	1107	She's telling us how to fight ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	1108	That's working with other nations.	0
ClaimBuster	1109	The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.	1
ClaimBuster	1110	There's just a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	1111	And we're more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1112	We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	1113	I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?	0
ClaimBuster	1114	If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages.	0
ClaimBuster	1115	I have a plan to cover those folks.	1
ClaimBuster	1116	A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.	0
ClaimBuster	1117	And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	1118	And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.	0
ClaimBuster	1119	Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1120	Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.	1
ClaimBuster	1121	Well, I would repeal and replace it.	0
ClaimBuster	1122	Now, what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis.	1
ClaimBuster	1123	Those things will get us the energy we need.	0
ClaimBuster	1124	It was the largest expansion of private insurance.	1
ClaimBuster	1125	This is something I take seriously and that's my position.	0
ClaimBuster	1126	I've worked on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person up here who hasn't been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1127	I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.	0
ClaimBuster	1128	I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.	1
ClaimBuster	1129	And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.	0
ClaimBuster	1130	We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products.	1
ClaimBuster	1131	The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.	0
ClaimBuster	1132	Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	1133	We've been drifting too long.	0
ClaimBuster	1134	And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.	1
ClaimBuster	1135	I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help.	0
ClaimBuster	1136	And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort.	1
ClaimBuster	1137	If I make a mistake, I admit it.	0
ClaimBuster	1138	I'm against quotas, they're illegal.	0
ClaimBuster	1139	We're working hard to sign up children.	0
ClaimBuster	1140	And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...	1
ClaimBuster	1141	But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us.	1
ClaimBuster	1142	And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.	1
ClaimBuster	1143	Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would have hoped would have brought peace to the Sudan.	1
ClaimBuster	1144	Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.	0
ClaimBuster	1145	But time is our friend there, because their leaders will change in not too many years, worst case, and their country is making great progress.	0
ClaimBuster	1146	We're down to 336 ships.	1
ClaimBuster	1147	People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice.	1
ClaimBuster	1148	Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	1149	We got to cut it out.	0
ClaimBuster	1150	We may differ about what the elements of that are.	0
ClaimBuster	1151	we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	1152	I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.	0
ClaimBuster	1153	And that's what the No Child Left Behind Act does.	0
ClaimBuster	1154	If we're going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and we've had more deployments under this administration than any time in history.	0
ClaimBuster	1155	It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.	0
ClaimBuster	1156	Well, let me just follow up, my friends.	0
ClaimBuster	1157	He called them coerced and the bribed.	1
ClaimBuster	1158	We're a country of laws.	0
ClaimBuster	1159	I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards.	0
ClaimBuster	1160	So we got to be guarded in our generosity.	0
ClaimBuster	1161	They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.	1
ClaimBuster	1162	But John is right we have to make cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	1163	That's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care.	0
ClaimBuster	1164	Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract and if so there will be bonus plans.	0
ClaimBuster	1165	Let's be honest about it.	0
ClaimBuster	1166	In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.	0
ClaimBuster	1167	But there are limits to what we can spend.	0
ClaimBuster	1168	America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.	0
ClaimBuster	1169	Then I would really focus on let's get these things out.	0
ClaimBuster	1170	And that is very important.	0
ClaimBuster	1171	So I think our selection uh - of Bob Dole as vice president uh - is based on merit.	0
ClaimBuster	1172	That makes life a lot easier.	0
ClaimBuster	1173	We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	1174	But no, I'm for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.	0
ClaimBuster	1175	We've got to remain energy-independent.	0
ClaimBuster	1176	And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half.	1
ClaimBuster	1177	We hammerlock the American companies -- American Airlines, Delta -- the last few great we have, because we're trying to do this deal with these 2 European companies.	1
ClaimBuster	1178	There's no way for our people now to understand what their government is.	0
ClaimBuster	1179	Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	1180	I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.	0
ClaimBuster	1181	Is our relative strength growing?	0
ClaimBuster	1182	And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.	0
ClaimBuster	1183	I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?	0
ClaimBuster	1184	If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1185	And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought.	0
ClaimBuster	1186	The trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the president vetoes it for them.	1
ClaimBuster	1187	Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds.	0
ClaimBuster	1188	This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.	0
ClaimBuster	1189	But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, it's just not responsive right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1190	"The ""we"" is you and me."	0
ClaimBuster	1191	I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.	0
ClaimBuster	1192	I will not cut benefits.	0
ClaimBuster	1193	So, under the circumstances, what do we do?	0
ClaimBuster	1194	Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today.	1
ClaimBuster	1195	You do a lot of things nobody knows about.	0
ClaimBuster	1196	We don't want to get drawn into a military conflict.	0
ClaimBuster	1197	And one last thing -- just -- just to make this point.	0
ClaimBuster	1198	In all due respect, I'm not so sure it's credible to quote leading news organizations about -- oh, never mind.	0
ClaimBuster	1199	I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.	0
ClaimBuster	1200	And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1201	This is a political year, and the President is playing politics with Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	1202	He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.	1
ClaimBuster	1203	Can you say that a little louder, Candy?	0
ClaimBuster	1204	We have to work with Nigeria.	0
ClaimBuster	1205	"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""	1
ClaimBuster	1206	You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1207	But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.	1
ClaimBuster	1208	Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day.	0
ClaimBuster	1209	We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.	0
ClaimBuster	1210	I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years.	1
ClaimBuster	1211	All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.	1
ClaimBuster	1212	Now, we may not succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	1213	Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed.	0
ClaimBuster	1214	Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened.	0
ClaimBuster	1215	Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.	0
ClaimBuster	1216	But let's get at the bottom line.	0
ClaimBuster	1217	And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.	0
ClaimBuster	1218	--notwithstanding my opponent's ad, my plan triggers in at gross incomes, family incomes of $200,000 and above.	1
ClaimBuster	1219	We are not at war with Islam.	1
ClaimBuster	1220	I hope not in both cases.	0
ClaimBuster	1221	And -- and I -- I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and -- and he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources, and -- and those terrible things may well happen from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	1222	And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.	1
ClaimBuster	1223	I would like to know from the governor -- I know we're not supposed to ask each other questions -- but I'd be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?	0
ClaimBuster	1224	And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.	0
ClaimBuster	1225	And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.	1
ClaimBuster	1226	I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day.	1
ClaimBuster	1227	That will change when I'm president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	1228	I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.	0
ClaimBuster	1229	"With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say ""never.''"	0
ClaimBuster	1230	I hope over the next ten years you will see a big increase over the percentage of people that have pension plans, plus a secure Social Security system.	0
ClaimBuster	1231	And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.	0
ClaimBuster	1232	So I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.	1
ClaimBuster	1233	We need to do better in job retraining.	0
ClaimBuster	1234	And the president and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith.	0
ClaimBuster	1235	I've had to make thousands of decisions, and each one of those decisions has been a learning process.	1
ClaimBuster	1236	And my program is this.	0
ClaimBuster	1237	I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.	0
ClaimBuster	1238	Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.	0
ClaimBuster	1239	The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security?	0
ClaimBuster	1240	Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	1241	That's not the right course for America.	0
ClaimBuster	1242	For instance, we're flying unmanned vehicles that can send real- time messages back to stations in the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	1243	And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas.	1
ClaimBuster	1244	Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women.	1
ClaimBuster	1245	He can talk about Iran/Contra and also-I'll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.	0
ClaimBuster	1246	And if you have some of each -- and I have some age, some experience and some intelligence -- that adds up to wisdom.	0
ClaimBuster	1247	We're trying to solve it.	0
ClaimBuster	1248	You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1249	Pardon means that what you did, whether it's right or wrong, you're forgiven for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1250	So that is not the way our democracy works.	0
ClaimBuster	1251	But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare.	0
ClaimBuster	1252	The American people don't know what those commitments are.	0
ClaimBuster	1253	These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan.	1
ClaimBuster	1254	That's why we say mutual and verifiable freezes.	0
ClaimBuster	1255	Was it the right thing to do?	0
ClaimBuster	1256	It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.	0
ClaimBuster	1257	Second, he's wrong in the analogies that he makes.	0
ClaimBuster	1258	I think that this farm policy has failed.	0
ClaimBuster	1259	I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.	1
ClaimBuster	1260	He was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasn't been sent to Congress in total; three years before an economic plan, and he still didn't say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break -- but he vetoed it anyway.	1
ClaimBuster	1261	And we work with those other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	1262	First thing I'm going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure we're not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1263	I think you put your finger on a major problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1264	But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.	1
ClaimBuster	1265	Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1266	Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you what's in the rescue package for you.	0
ClaimBuster	1267	They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.	0
ClaimBuster	1268	Now, results is what counts.	0
ClaimBuster	1269	Convention, the VFW National Convention - when I spoke to each of those bodies - I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses.	1
ClaimBuster	1270	We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.	0
ClaimBuster	1271	And that's exactly what I have proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	1272	And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.	0
ClaimBuster	1273	This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.	0
ClaimBuster	1274	But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.	1
ClaimBuster	1275	Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	1276	I don't favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution.	0
ClaimBuster	1277	And I am not apologetic at all about our record with women.	0
ClaimBuster	1278	But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?	0
ClaimBuster	1279	Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.	0
ClaimBuster	1280	Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work.	0
ClaimBuster	1281	OK, so it hasn't fallen.	0
ClaimBuster	1282	He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn't happen.	1
ClaimBuster	1283	And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if there's anybody here who thinks there aren't agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	1284	As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes.	0
ClaimBuster	1285	Senator Kennedy is in the hospital.	1
ClaimBuster	1286	So let's not be throwing stones about it.	0
ClaimBuster	1287	We're making really good progress.	0
ClaimBuster	1288	It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	1289	But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.	1
ClaimBuster	1290	Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.	1
ClaimBuster	1291	The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.	1
ClaimBuster	1292	Energy independence for North America in five years.	0
ClaimBuster	1293	Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse.	1
ClaimBuster	1294	He founded authored, the job training partnership act.	1
ClaimBuster	1295	Now that sounds to me a little bit different.	0
ClaimBuster	1296	But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1297	Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.	0
ClaimBuster	1298	And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.	0
ClaimBuster	1299	That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	1300	Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1301	So I would be firm.	0
ClaimBuster	1302	And so please, go to...	0
ClaimBuster	1303	And then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?	0
ClaimBuster	1304	Is that a -- is that a separate topic?	0
ClaimBuster	1305	And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.	0
ClaimBuster	1306	And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.	1
ClaimBuster	1307	And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.	0
ClaimBuster	1308	I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.	1
ClaimBuster	1309	That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.	0
ClaimBuster	1310	And housing has begun to rise.	1
ClaimBuster	1311	They can't squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class.	0
ClaimBuster	1312	I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.	0
ClaimBuster	1313	That's the kind of approach that will work.	0
ClaimBuster	1314	At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares.	1
ClaimBuster	1315	And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.	1
ClaimBuster	1316	And there's nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace.	0
ClaimBuster	1317	I believe that discipline and respect for the law -- all of these things should be taught to children, not in our schools, but families have to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	1318	It's not just more troops.	0
ClaimBuster	1319	I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	1320	Now, you cite a study.	1
ClaimBuster	1321	Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies.	0
ClaimBuster	1322	And then that number disappears for high-income people.	1
ClaimBuster	1323	[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1324	Now, just remember when you think about me -- I didn't create this mess.	0
ClaimBuster	1325	We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history.	0
ClaimBuster	1326	When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam.	1
ClaimBuster	1327	When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.	1
ClaimBuster	1328	I don't think it's the issues that turn kids off.	0
ClaimBuster	1329	And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.	0
ClaimBuster	1330	My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	1331	We will do what we do best.	0
ClaimBuster	1332	He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.	1
ClaimBuster	1333	Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	1334	He said the standard bearer wasn't for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1335	Let's, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system.	0
ClaimBuster	1336	It's critical to our future.	0
ClaimBuster	1337	He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.	0
ClaimBuster	1338	We have to start to spend the money now.	0
ClaimBuster	1339	The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.	1
ClaimBuster	1340	But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.	0
ClaimBuster	1341	How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?	0
ClaimBuster	1342	There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.	1
ClaimBuster	1343	I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.	0
ClaimBuster	1344	I guess I rely more on the individual.	0
ClaimBuster	1345	And I would cite again Dan Quayle.	0
ClaimBuster	1346	I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.	1
ClaimBuster	1347	I've laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq: with a summit, by doing better training, faster, by cutting -- by doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections.	1
ClaimBuster	1348	I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.	0
ClaimBuster	1349	And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer.	0
ClaimBuster	1350	"""Those are the three words that she left me with."	1
ClaimBuster	1351	And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.	0
ClaimBuster	1352	We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue.	0
ClaimBuster	1353	We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.	0
ClaimBuster	1354	In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.	0
ClaimBuster	1355	The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it.	1
ClaimBuster	1356	He said, we will look at offshore drilling.	1
ClaimBuster	1357	I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.	0
ClaimBuster	1358	The opportunities that the child will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.	0
ClaimBuster	1359	Uh - the Department of uh - uh - HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh - outlaws, that takes care of redlining.	1
ClaimBuster	1360	So hold the line on Social Security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program.	0
ClaimBuster	1361	We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be.	1
ClaimBuster	1362	It's clear for everybody to see.	0
ClaimBuster	1363	I've visited so many communities.	1
ClaimBuster	1364	Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.	0
ClaimBuster	1365	I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way.	1
ClaimBuster	1366	We couldn't get it done, because I wasn't enforceable.	0
ClaimBuster	1367	Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them.	1
ClaimBuster	1368	Do you want to give me some suggestions?	0
ClaimBuster	1369	I want to thank the League of Women Voters, the good citizens of Kansas City, and President Reagan for agreeing to debate this evening.	0
ClaimBuster	1370	High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.	0
ClaimBuster	1371	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.	1
ClaimBuster	1372	But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	1373	Going to be more deaths that they thought.	0
ClaimBuster	1374	I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean it is less likely we have to use force.	0
ClaimBuster	1375	I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.	1
ClaimBuster	1376	Jim, the president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important in this debate.	0
ClaimBuster	1377	Four of them here tonight.	1
ClaimBuster	1378	One of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business.	1
ClaimBuster	1379	She's got experience, but it's bad experience.	0
ClaimBuster	1380	Secondly, allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1381	But history will look back, and I'm fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration, because the president makes the decisions, the president has to take the responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	1382	Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there.	1
ClaimBuster	1383	What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.	0
ClaimBuster	1384	The world is more dangerous.	0
ClaimBuster	1385	I believe that's the answer.	0
ClaimBuster	1386	Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	1387	We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.	0
ClaimBuster	1388	What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them.	1
ClaimBuster	1389	"He keeps talking about, ""Let the inspectors do their job."""	0
ClaimBuster	1390	I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people.	0
ClaimBuster	1391	Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.	1
ClaimBuster	1392	Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon.	0
ClaimBuster	1393	And I want to talk about my plan some more -- I hope we can.	0
ClaimBuster	1394	Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.	0
ClaimBuster	1395	I agree that the surplus is the American people's money, it's your money.	0
ClaimBuster	1396	The president has a great responsibility.	1
ClaimBuster	1397	Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.	0
ClaimBuster	1398	We'll be on again Saturday night, 8 to 9 o'clock on ABC.	1
ClaimBuster	1399	The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability.	0
ClaimBuster	1400	Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	1401	And so I just have a different approach.	0
ClaimBuster	1402	I have seen Communist influence and Castro influence rise in Latin America.	0
ClaimBuster	1403	We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains.	1
ClaimBuster	1404	And we admire your pluck and perseverance.	0
ClaimBuster	1405	And we've focused on the tactical.	0
ClaimBuster	1406	That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.	0
ClaimBuster	1407	So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who's still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working.	0
ClaimBuster	1408	Mr. Corddry, it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present.	0
ClaimBuster	1409	I think that's about a realistic timeframe.	0
ClaimBuster	1410	My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?	0
ClaimBuster	1411	And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.	0
ClaimBuster	1412	All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it - just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country - urban .	0
ClaimBuster	1413	They put up the American flag.	0
ClaimBuster	1414	Now we have to succeed.	0
ClaimBuster	1415	Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.	1
ClaimBuster	1416	Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy.	0
ClaimBuster	1417	We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.	0
ClaimBuster	1418	Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.	1
ClaimBuster	1419	There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.	1
ClaimBuster	1420	Doing better in the neighborhoods.	0
ClaimBuster	1421	We're headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration.	0
ClaimBuster	1422	I know what it's like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator.	0
ClaimBuster	1423	So it's adding to cost.	1
ClaimBuster	1424	Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.	0
ClaimBuster	1425	I've got a plan on Medicare, for example, that's a two-stage plan that says we'll have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program.	1
ClaimBuster	1426	I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies.	0
ClaimBuster	1427	He got a notice or he didn't.	0
ClaimBuster	1428	I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and makes some discipline and protects the taxpayer.	0
ClaimBuster	1429	I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.	1
ClaimBuster	1430	There's no -- and we have to do them all at once.	0
ClaimBuster	1431	We've got home ownership at a 15-year high.	1
ClaimBuster	1432	Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.	1
ClaimBuster	1433	You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.	1
ClaimBuster	1434	He doesn't want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people.	0
ClaimBuster	1435	We're going to block grant into the states.	0
ClaimBuster	1436	That's not a grand coalition.	0
ClaimBuster	1437	And yet Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	1438	We're still down 580,000 jobs.	1
ClaimBuster	1439	Brady Bill, I agree that it's a timid step in the right direction but it won't fix it.	0
ClaimBuster	1440	There have been some tough cases come across my desk.	0
ClaimBuster	1441	Well, it's not a matter of uh - Republican and Democrat.	0
ClaimBuster	1442	I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think we've come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off.	0
ClaimBuster	1443	Now, for four years that's what I worked on.	1
ClaimBuster	1444	Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.	1
ClaimBuster	1445	One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not.	0
ClaimBuster	1446	We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1447	Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.	0
ClaimBuster	1448	This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1449	It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel.	0
ClaimBuster	1450	We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.	0
ClaimBuster	1451	And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	1452	If I'm president, I'll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska.	0
ClaimBuster	1453	But we are putting our energy companies out of business.	1
ClaimBuster	1454	And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1455	This is an issue they've brought up.	1
ClaimBuster	1456	Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer.	1
ClaimBuster	1457	They just write a note for the interest.	0
ClaimBuster	1458	We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.	1
ClaimBuster	1459	And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.	0
ClaimBuster	1460	And we ought to expand our markets abroad.	0
ClaimBuster	1461	Well, first, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut.	0
ClaimBuster	1462	We have a big program in my state that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school.	1
ClaimBuster	1463	We've got to treat it as international crime.	0
ClaimBuster	1464	And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.	1
ClaimBuster	1465	Nuclear is the single greatest threat.	0
ClaimBuster	1466	Well, that just isn't true.	0
ClaimBuster	1467	But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.	0
ClaimBuster	1468	That's part of my health care plan.	1
ClaimBuster	1469	Let me just say, Bob.	0
ClaimBuster	1470	We've opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since I've been president.	1
ClaimBuster	1471	That doesn't restrict people's freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	1472	Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.	1
ClaimBuster	1473	I met a man who spent eight months in prison, wasn't even allowed to call his lawyer, wasn't allowed to get -- finally, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois intervened and was able to get him out.	1
ClaimBuster	1474	A lot remains to be done.	0
ClaimBuster	1475	I'm happy to do that, too.	0
ClaimBuster	1476	I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela.	0
ClaimBuster	1477	It's not good for the country and it's not right.	0
ClaimBuster	1478	Mr. Nixon resigned, and I became president.	1
ClaimBuster	1479	But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.	0
ClaimBuster	1480	Pakistan is -- is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now.	0
ClaimBuster	1481	The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.	0
ClaimBuster	1482	I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.	1
ClaimBuster	1483	How do you get anything done when you've got all of these political action committees, all of these thousands of registered lobbyists -- 40,000 registered lobbyists, 23,000 special interest groups -- and the list goes on and on and on.	1
ClaimBuster	1484	I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	1485	And that's a whole lot different from these fellows running up and down the halls whispering in their ears now and promising campaign funds for the next election if they do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1486	And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.	0
ClaimBuster	1487	I did support the '76 measure that he told about, because we were in a deep recession and we needed some stimulation.	1
ClaimBuster	1488	I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth.	0
ClaimBuster	1489	I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don't believe...	0
ClaimBuster	1490	I've recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn't do anything wrong.	1
ClaimBuster	1491	You were totally in favor of it.	1
ClaimBuster	1492	I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that.	0
ClaimBuster	1493	See, the card, it'll have a period of time attached to it.	0
ClaimBuster	1494	The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.	1
ClaimBuster	1495	Then you said we should.	1
ClaimBuster	1496	To me, that's the best way to secure America.	0
ClaimBuster	1497	We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.	0
ClaimBuster	1498	I came away convinced that, if we worked at it, if we were ready to work and letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, they'd be there with us.	0
ClaimBuster	1499	Maybe that was the purpose.	0
ClaimBuster	1500	The place where we've seen manufacturing go has been China.	1
ClaimBuster	1501	But have no doubt that Russia's behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become, because of their petro dollars.	0
ClaimBuster	1502	We just have a different philosophy.	0
ClaimBuster	1503	But let's not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that'll simply price us out of the international market.	0
ClaimBuster	1504	We tried to overturn it in the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	1505	But not due to his policies.	0
ClaimBuster	1506	And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power.	0
ClaimBuster	1507	And I think first you should -- I should understand that the question on your mind is do I understand your problem.	0
ClaimBuster	1508	There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.	0
ClaimBuster	1509	These terrorists are serious, they're deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill.	0
ClaimBuster	1510	And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.	1
ClaimBuster	1511	The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor.	1
ClaimBuster	1512	I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.	1
ClaimBuster	1513	I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.	1
ClaimBuster	1514	We try to help people with disabilities.	0
ClaimBuster	1515	And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?	0
ClaimBuster	1516	Well, it's been a privilege to be able to talk to the American people tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	1517	I think it's accurate to say that in uh - two years ago when Mr. Nixon - Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh - excused as were - as were the uh - the ones who evaded the draft.	1
ClaimBuster	1518	I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.	0
ClaimBuster	1519	I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.	0
ClaimBuster	1520	And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	1521	He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and that's the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives.	0
ClaimBuster	1522	The jobs the president is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing.	1
ClaimBuster	1523	No child should be left behind in America.	0
ClaimBuster	1524	I think it's the tone.	0
ClaimBuster	1525	I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.	0
ClaimBuster	1526	The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history.	0
ClaimBuster	1527	And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.	0
ClaimBuster	1528	And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years.	1
ClaimBuster	1529	But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.	0
ClaimBuster	1530	This is not a Wall Street tax cut.	0
ClaimBuster	1531	And I think his present position is he would not do so, and if that's true I'm grateful for it.	0
ClaimBuster	1532	And let me tell you...	0
ClaimBuster	1533	I think we're ready to move.	0
ClaimBuster	1534	You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.	1
ClaimBuster	1535	I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.	0
ClaimBuster	1536	But more than that, they are role models.	0
ClaimBuster	1537	To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.	0
ClaimBuster	1538	I think it is good.	0
ClaimBuster	1539	I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.	1
ClaimBuster	1540	And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.	0
ClaimBuster	1541	We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	1542	Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.	0
ClaimBuster	1543	They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring.	0
ClaimBuster	1544	But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.	0
ClaimBuster	1545	And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.	0
ClaimBuster	1546	And Colin Powell helped set up that summit.	1
ClaimBuster	1547	I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century.	0
ClaimBuster	1548	You get to defer your taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	1549	So I know what it's like to have to look welfare head-on.	0
ClaimBuster	1550	The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.	1
ClaimBuster	1551	Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again.	0
ClaimBuster	1552	And I favor the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	1553	We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.	1
ClaimBuster	1554	I have fought against special interests.	1
ClaimBuster	1555	And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked.	0
ClaimBuster	1556	I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.	0
ClaimBuster	1557	One is the Middle East, and that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations, because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there.	0
ClaimBuster	1558	Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing.	0
ClaimBuster	1559	She understands that better than almost any American that I know.	0
ClaimBuster	1560	I want the future of this country to be as bright and brilliant as its past, and it can be if we have the courage to change.	0
ClaimBuster	1561	They're going to have to make the decision themselves.	0
ClaimBuster	1562	Our schools are now better.	0
ClaimBuster	1563	When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question.	0
ClaimBuster	1564	"And I believe the answer to that has to also be ""yes.''"	0
ClaimBuster	1565	I know many of her donors.	0
ClaimBuster	1566	That just happened, and many more are coming.	1
ClaimBuster	1567	George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill.	1
ClaimBuster	1568	We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.	1
ClaimBuster	1569	But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we've made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe.	1
ClaimBuster	1570	Now we've got three of them.	1
ClaimBuster	1571	We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.	1
ClaimBuster	1572	And I appreciate that question.	0
ClaimBuster	1573	That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.	0
ClaimBuster	1574	We are a goldfish bowl before the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1575	And what I've proposed, you'll hear Senator McCain say, well, he's proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually I'm cutting more than I'm spending so that it will be a net spending cut.	1
ClaimBuster	1576	Most people want to see their own doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	1577	And under the plan that I've proposed, 80% of all family farms will be completely exempt from the estate tax.	1
ClaimBuster	1578	About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.	1
ClaimBuster	1579	Well, that's what a President's supposed to know -- where those weapons are going to be.	0
ClaimBuster	1580	You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price.	1
ClaimBuster	1581	And this means more than what we've been doing.	0
ClaimBuster	1582	He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it.	1
ClaimBuster	1583	Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.	0
ClaimBuster	1584	And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.	1
ClaimBuster	1585	I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.	1
ClaimBuster	1586	If you own the land, every day is Earth Day.	0
ClaimBuster	1587	But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions.	1
ClaimBuster	1588	It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.	0
ClaimBuster	1589	They didn't go over to coddle.	0
ClaimBuster	1590	The question which we have to decide as Americans - are we doing enough today?	0
ClaimBuster	1591	And did the person have full access to the courts of law?	0
ClaimBuster	1592	Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on.	0
ClaimBuster	1593	Will women's rights be protected?	0
ClaimBuster	1594	Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children.	0
ClaimBuster	1595	We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1596	This nation is the hope of the earth.	0
ClaimBuster	1597	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	1598	Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.	0
ClaimBuster	1599	If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	1600	That's the way we leave it.	0
ClaimBuster	1601	Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach.	1
ClaimBuster	1602	Again, this is just a difference of opinion.	0
ClaimBuster	1603	Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology.	1
ClaimBuster	1604	We've done a long way working together to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	1605	And there was no demonstration involved.	1
ClaimBuster	1606	You get a catastrophic plan to help you on it.	0
ClaimBuster	1607	I know others disagree with it.	0
ClaimBuster	1608	Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?	0
ClaimBuster	1609	Look, that's where World War I started in the Balkans.	1
ClaimBuster	1610	It's going to be tough fighting.	0
ClaimBuster	1611	And I think they deserve a family and medical leave act.	0
ClaimBuster	1612	And we have an opportunity now with improved transportation systems and improved loading facilities in our ports, to see a very good opportunity on a world international market, to replace OPEC oil with American coal as a basic energy source.	1
ClaimBuster	1613	That's not what we are going to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1614	But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.	1
ClaimBuster	1615	Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck.	0
ClaimBuster	1616	But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.	1
ClaimBuster	1617	But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side.	0
ClaimBuster	1618	Thank you very much to the university, again.	0
ClaimBuster	1619	I represented upstate New York.	1
ClaimBuster	1620	I came from very modest means.	1
ClaimBuster	1621	The Vice President ignored them.	1
ClaimBuster	1622	I've got a strategy for the Middle East.	0
ClaimBuster	1623	I'm also going to talk -- respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	1624	First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.	0
ClaimBuster	1625	Fifty times we deployed troops around the world.	1
ClaimBuster	1626	But we will defend the citizens of this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1627	You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all.	1
ClaimBuster	1628	There is a lot of blame to go around.	0
ClaimBuster	1629	That's one of the main reasons that we've had such an increase in the number of people employed.	1
ClaimBuster	1630	The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the -- the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these -- these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.	0
ClaimBuster	1631	We owe you a debt we can never repay you.	0
ClaimBuster	1632	And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.	0
ClaimBuster	1633	Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.	1
ClaimBuster	1634	You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.	1
ClaimBuster	1635	You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.	0
ClaimBuster	1636	And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.	1
ClaimBuster	1637	Off-road diesel engines -- we have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1638	So we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers.	0
ClaimBuster	1639	First of all, when we and our allies -- the Italians, the French, and the United Kingdom -- went into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government.	1
ClaimBuster	1640	I don't think we're a declining nation.	0
ClaimBuster	1641	I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases.	0
ClaimBuster	1642	And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign.	1
ClaimBuster	1643	The difference is we've got a new policy.	1
ClaimBuster	1644	I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families.	0
ClaimBuster	1645	I agree with the president that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are.	0
ClaimBuster	1646	So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.	1
ClaimBuster	1647	The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.	1
ClaimBuster	1648	It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.	0
ClaimBuster	1649	So I salute these things.	0
ClaimBuster	1650	We have the right approach for the future and looks at the results.	0
ClaimBuster	1651	We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.	1
ClaimBuster	1652	But I don't think we need these other systems.	0
ClaimBuster	1653	The people in Washington are good people.	0
ClaimBuster	1654	By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	1655	We have to stop them from leaving.	0
ClaimBuster	1656	Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up.	1
ClaimBuster	1657	I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.	0
ClaimBuster	1658	My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.	0
ClaimBuster	1659	But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.	0
ClaimBuster	1660	I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.	0
ClaimBuster	1661	I've seen the tough times, I know they can be better and I'll lead America to a brighter future.	0
ClaimBuster	1662	I might say too, that - that if we see that these goals cannot be reached - and I believe they're reasonable goals - then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year '81 which is the last year of the next term.	0
ClaimBuster	1663	We need to reform it.	0
ClaimBuster	1664	He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.	1
ClaimBuster	1665	First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran.	0
ClaimBuster	1666	They're going backwards on the water quality.	1
ClaimBuster	1667	That's why I'd have regulation.	0
ClaimBuster	1668	For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.	1
ClaimBuster	1669	I think we can say, through the Packard Commission Report and I'm very proud that David Packard, the originator of that report, is strongly supporting me.	1
ClaimBuster	1670	I'm opposed to the death penalty.	0
ClaimBuster	1671	And I intend to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	1672	Nothing could be further from the truth.	0
ClaimBuster	1673	Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.	0
ClaimBuster	1674	The challenges that we face are unprecedented.	0
ClaimBuster	1675	But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.	0
ClaimBuster	1676	I voted for the balanced budget in '93 and '97.	1
ClaimBuster	1677	But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.	1
ClaimBuster	1678	And I'd be happy to discuss these other issues, but I can't believe he is accusing me of getting on both sides.	1
ClaimBuster	1679	He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.	1
ClaimBuster	1680	Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldn't pick.	0
ClaimBuster	1681	With regard to Medicare, no, but it's time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound.	0
ClaimBuster	1682	I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America.	0
ClaimBuster	1683	My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C.	0
ClaimBuster	1684	And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	1685	And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.	1
ClaimBuster	1686	So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.	0
ClaimBuster	1687	But, I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred.	0
ClaimBuster	1688	But it isn't going to get the job done if we don't change K through 12.	0
ClaimBuster	1689	We didn't ask for it.	0
ClaimBuster	1690	"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did."""	0
ClaimBuster	1691	Secondly, if you were so opposed to the grain embargo, why did you ask the godfather of the grain embargo to be one of your top foreign policy advisers?	0
ClaimBuster	1692	John Edwards is the author of the Patients' Bill of Rights.	1
ClaimBuster	1693	And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.	0
ClaimBuster	1694	What was his participation there?	0
ClaimBuster	1695	We invested in a solar company, our country.	1
ClaimBuster	1696	As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.	0
ClaimBuster	1697	No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system.	0
ClaimBuster	1698	We're beginning to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	1699	I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true.	0
ClaimBuster	1700	And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom.	0
ClaimBuster	1701	I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile.	0
ClaimBuster	1702	And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.	1
ClaimBuster	1703	And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	1704	But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy.	0
ClaimBuster	1705	I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims.	1
ClaimBuster	1706	It is not enough for us simply to be the strongest nation militarily, the strongest economically, and also to have firm diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	1707	There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	1708	This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.	1
ClaimBuster	1709	Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections.	0
ClaimBuster	1710	I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.	0
ClaimBuster	1711	(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point?	0
ClaimBuster	1712	And we're the most religious people on Earth.	1
ClaimBuster	1713	Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.	1
ClaimBuster	1714	For 200 years, we've lived in the future, believing that tomorrow would be better than today, and today would be better than yesterday.	1
ClaimBuster	1715	We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.	0
ClaimBuster	1716	She shouldn't be allowed to run.	0
ClaimBuster	1717	It's one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	1718	uh - The estimate of the outside, if you eliminated all tax shelters, is 5 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	1719	He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.	1
ClaimBuster	1720	Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.	0
ClaimBuster	1721	We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1722	Hillary, you have no idea.	0
ClaimBuster	1723	I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge.	0
ClaimBuster	1724	There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.	1
ClaimBuster	1725	So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.	0
ClaimBuster	1726	One last point I want to make on energy.	0
ClaimBuster	1727	We can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.	1
ClaimBuster	1728	I think we need to fully enforce the law.	0
ClaimBuster	1729	Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.	0
ClaimBuster	1730	Their currency has dropped 80 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	1731	But Obamacare has to go.	0
ClaimBuster	1732	We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.	1
ClaimBuster	1733	Well, first of all, it is just not true that I haven't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.	1
ClaimBuster	1734	And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.	1
ClaimBuster	1735	If it hadn't been for us, Saddam Hussein would be sitting on top of three-fifths of the oil supply of the world and he'd have nuclear weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	1736	It's between a woman, God and her doctor.	0
ClaimBuster	1737	At the American Conference - Inter-American Conference this summer, when we wanted them to join together in the denunciation of Castro and the Cuban Communists, we couldn't even get the Inter-American group to join together in denouncing Castro.	1
ClaimBuster	1738	That's what distinguishes us from the enemy.	0
ClaimBuster	1739	But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.	0
ClaimBuster	1740	It's pretty clear that was a quota case, and just because one teacher was white and one black and they had the same qualifications, you know they decided who would stay there.	0
ClaimBuster	1741	We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home's worth over 500,000 dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	1742	If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested.	0
ClaimBuster	1743	You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.	0
ClaimBuster	1744	But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things.	0
ClaimBuster	1745	We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.	0
ClaimBuster	1746	If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.	0
ClaimBuster	1747	And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.	0
ClaimBuster	1748	How could we have not known?	0
ClaimBuster	1749	I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.	0
ClaimBuster	1750	Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it.	0
ClaimBuster	1751	If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.	0
ClaimBuster	1752	The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes.	1
ClaimBuster	1753	Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	1754	It seems to me that you have a selective memory.	0
ClaimBuster	1755	And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.	1
ClaimBuster	1756	That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?	0
ClaimBuster	1757	And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place.	0
ClaimBuster	1758	Mr. Bush talked about values.	0
ClaimBuster	1759	Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.	1
ClaimBuster	1760	We have done the following things: Number one, we've managed the aftermath of the Cold War, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	1761	I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.	0
ClaimBuster	1762	It's now 121/4, and I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly.	1
ClaimBuster	1763	Number two, we've got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority.	0
ClaimBuster	1764	President Clinton came to California in 1992.	1
ClaimBuster	1765	It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	1766	The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan.	0
ClaimBuster	1767	I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.	0
ClaimBuster	1768	You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.	1
ClaimBuster	1769	I sold them my remaining shares.	1
ClaimBuster	1770	It's a lot of money to protect other people.	0
ClaimBuster	1771	We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.	1
ClaimBuster	1772	-- we haven't had the leadership in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.	0
ClaimBuster	1773	And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.	0
ClaimBuster	1774	And there are a number of things.	0
ClaimBuster	1775	It was laughed at all over the world what happened.	0
ClaimBuster	1776	Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the president's tax cut.	1
ClaimBuster	1777	And I know they say it doesn't rank anywhere on the polls.	1
ClaimBuster	1778	We took our eye off the ball.	0
ClaimBuster	1779	Now, if that's true, just tell me now.	0
ClaimBuster	1780	If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts.	0
ClaimBuster	1781	"I didn't hear the word ""liberal"" or ""left"" one time."	0
ClaimBuster	1782	And they have not got it done.	1
ClaimBuster	1783	I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.	0
ClaimBuster	1784	I'm ready to go at it right now.	1
ClaimBuster	1785	Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	1786	"And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Senator Clinton and said, ""I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision,"" you didn't tell the American people the truth because you didn't."	1
ClaimBuster	1787	But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.	0
ClaimBuster	1788	And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasn't a popular move.	0
ClaimBuster	1789	I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first.	0
ClaimBuster	1790	Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.	0
ClaimBuster	1791	But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them.	0
ClaimBuster	1792	The plane wasn't flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money.	1
ClaimBuster	1793	No, you are the one that's unfit.	0
ClaimBuster	1794	Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.	0
ClaimBuster	1795	A lot of people, including me, said, look, it's not doing what it should do.	1
ClaimBuster	1796	But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating.	0
ClaimBuster	1797	Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	1798	But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.	1
ClaimBuster	1799	But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.	0
ClaimBuster	1800	This is what a president has to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1801	I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.	0
ClaimBuster	1802	We didn't guard the borders.	0
ClaimBuster	1803	I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.	1
ClaimBuster	1804	And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear.	0
ClaimBuster	1805	So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.	1
ClaimBuster	1806	I feel very strongly the same place.	0
ClaimBuster	1807	There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	1808	But my economic program is the kind of change we want.	0
ClaimBuster	1809	And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.	0
ClaimBuster	1810	There isn't any such thing as something free out there.	0
ClaimBuster	1811	May I disagree with the premise of your question?	0
ClaimBuster	1812	And so they're looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time.	0
ClaimBuster	1813	That's what America's all about.	0
ClaimBuster	1814	"I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. """	1
ClaimBuster	1815	I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.	1
ClaimBuster	1816	And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.	0
ClaimBuster	1817	And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.	1
ClaimBuster	1818	And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	1819	Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival.	0
ClaimBuster	1820	By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.	1
ClaimBuster	1821	So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.	0
ClaimBuster	1822	And we've got a lot of work to do.	0
ClaimBuster	1823	And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.	0
ClaimBuster	1824	I can see how tough that terrain is.	0
ClaimBuster	1825	By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved.	0
ClaimBuster	1826	In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.	0
ClaimBuster	1827	Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family.	1
ClaimBuster	1828	"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, ""Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs."	1
ClaimBuster	1829	I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.	0
ClaimBuster	1830	Well I'm glad you asked.	0
ClaimBuster	1831	We've got a pilot program.	1
ClaimBuster	1832	About a thousand raised their hands.	1
ClaimBuster	1833	We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.	0
ClaimBuster	1834	You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces.	0
ClaimBuster	1835	I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile.	0
ClaimBuster	1836	She finally gave it up.	1
ClaimBuster	1837	And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.	0
ClaimBuster	1838	They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.	0
ClaimBuster	1839	I mean, you may be sending a signal.	0
ClaimBuster	1840	That's what she told me her husband understood.	1
ClaimBuster	1841	Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?	0
ClaimBuster	1842	And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.	0
ClaimBuster	1843	Now, I've got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain's history, not surprisingly.	0
ClaimBuster	1844	Unfortunately, we didn't have more questions on that.	1
ClaimBuster	1845	What message does that send our troops?	0
ClaimBuster	1846	I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.	0
ClaimBuster	1847	We need to keep that in line.	0
ClaimBuster	1848	And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.	1
ClaimBuster	1849	I mean, you say we've done all these bad things, which isn't the case.	0
ClaimBuster	1850	It's just pouring and destroying their youth.	0
ClaimBuster	1851	That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy.	1
ClaimBuster	1852	We have not been updating from the new standpoint.	1
ClaimBuster	1853	We've doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it.	1
ClaimBuster	1854	But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	1855	September the 11th changed how America must look at the world.	0
ClaimBuster	1856	He has a one-point plan.	1
ClaimBuster	1857	I'm not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel-mill capacity unused.	1
ClaimBuster	1858	And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet.	0
ClaimBuster	1859	We have gone from first to thirteenth in wages in the world in the last twelve years, since Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan have been in.	1
ClaimBuster	1860	Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way -- all the way through.	0
ClaimBuster	1861	It didn't look good the first two years when we had a Democratic president and Ã‚ Democratic Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	1862	When I was running -- when we had the debate in 2000, never dreamt I'd be doing that.	0
ClaimBuster	1863	I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	1864	Come on, that's not leadership.	0
ClaimBuster	1865	I'm not going to increase taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1866	She's the 36th student in that classroom.	1
ClaimBuster	1867	This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.	0
ClaimBuster	1868	Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.	0
ClaimBuster	1869	I sure stopped their budget.	1
ClaimBuster	1870	It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.	1
ClaimBuster	1871	You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.	0
ClaimBuster	1872	They inform on the bad guys.	0
ClaimBuster	1873	And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	1874	But he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more.	0
ClaimBuster	1875	None of them ever get implemented because -- let me give you an example.	0
ClaimBuster	1876	We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you don't know how to do: We balanced the budget.	1
ClaimBuster	1877	And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts.	1
ClaimBuster	1878	This has already passed the House, and it has an excellent prospect to pass the Senate.	1
ClaimBuster	1879	I want a smaller and smarter government.	0
ClaimBuster	1880	I say it all the time.	0
ClaimBuster	1881	I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.	0
ClaimBuster	1882	In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.	0
ClaimBuster	1883	See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.	0
ClaimBuster	1884	This is a responsibility of the president.	0
ClaimBuster	1885	I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.	0
ClaimBuster	1886	And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt.	1
ClaimBuster	1887	So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.	0
ClaimBuster	1888	I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again.	0
ClaimBuster	1889	So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.	0
ClaimBuster	1890	The Soviet Union sat at the table knowing that we had gone forward with unilateral concessions without any reciprocation from them whatsoever.	0
ClaimBuster	1891	He says don't do it, but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on M.F.N.	1
ClaimBuster	1892	I believe that we need to export more so I'll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family.	0
ClaimBuster	1893	And I suspect, given his record, he's going to raise taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1894	Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.	0
ClaimBuster	1895	Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.	0
ClaimBuster	1896	Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you.	0
ClaimBuster	1897	Thank you, Carole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	0
ClaimBuster	1898	I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.	1
ClaimBuster	1899	When they had a 250 billion dollar tax scheme, that is half the size of this one.	1
ClaimBuster	1900	I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth.	0
ClaimBuster	1901	Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	1902	I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.	1
ClaimBuster	1903	I believe America's best days are ahead of us.	0
ClaimBuster	1904	But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.	1
ClaimBuster	1905	My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting.	0
ClaimBuster	1906	I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.	0
ClaimBuster	1907	Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.	0
ClaimBuster	1908	If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing.	0
ClaimBuster	1909	Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country.	1
ClaimBuster	1910	I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing.	1
ClaimBuster	1911	Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power.	1
ClaimBuster	1912	Well, I'm not for registration.	0
ClaimBuster	1913	You've got to free up the private sector.	0
ClaimBuster	1914	Is that a new question or a 30-second question?	0
ClaimBuster	1915	Here are the key ingredients.	0
ClaimBuster	1916	And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.	0
ClaimBuster	1917	If we don't get the economy to grow, if we don't cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, we're going to limp into the next century.	0
ClaimBuster	1918	Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote?	1
ClaimBuster	1919	What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.	0
ClaimBuster	1920	Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.	0
ClaimBuster	1921	And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.	0
ClaimBuster	1922	Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.	1
ClaimBuster	1923	In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.	1
ClaimBuster	1924	You're right, what does matter is a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	1925	Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright.	0
ClaimBuster	1926	So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	1927	I think the Communists have been moving with vigor - Laos, Africa, Cuba - all around the world today they're on the move.	0
ClaimBuster	1928	I have a plan to cover all Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	1929	I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.	0
ClaimBuster	1930	So that's on the record.	0
ClaimBuster	1931	And it was terminated by current mayor.	1
ClaimBuster	1932	Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there.	1
ClaimBuster	1933	And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.	0
ClaimBuster	1934	What should I have done?	0
ClaimBuster	1935	China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are.	1
ClaimBuster	1936	Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.	0
ClaimBuster	1937	You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.	0
ClaimBuster	1938	Our troops have performed brilliantly.	0
ClaimBuster	1939	Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army.	1
ClaimBuster	1940	Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.	1
ClaimBuster	1941	We've created, and I'm not aiming at any one person here, I'm aiming at our government -- nobody takes responsibility for anything.	0
ClaimBuster	1942	We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.	1
ClaimBuster	1943	I want you to be on my team.	1
ClaimBuster	1944	I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay.	0
ClaimBuster	1945	One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	1946	It's not a grand diversion.	0
ClaimBuster	1947	Yes, I mean, he's got a record.	0
ClaimBuster	1948	We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing.	0
ClaimBuster	1949	If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up.	0
ClaimBuster	1950	Now, we've seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs created.	1
ClaimBuster	1951	It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.	1
ClaimBuster	1952	Our allies feel that we've neglected them.	0
ClaimBuster	1953	We're going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work.	0
ClaimBuster	1954	The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened.	1
ClaimBuster	1955	Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform.	0
ClaimBuster	1956	I think everybody's paying too much taxes.	0
ClaimBuster	1957	Well, I'm glad you raised that question.	0
ClaimBuster	1958	Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.	0
ClaimBuster	1959	They currently favor going forward with a runoff election.	1
ClaimBuster	1960	We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	1961	Two hundred years ago, Tom Paine, when the 13 tiny colonies were trying to become a nation, said, we have it in our power to begin the world over again.	1
ClaimBuster	1962	Because you have nothing to say.	0
ClaimBuster	1963	Whether we're going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns.	0
ClaimBuster	1964	My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American.	1
ClaimBuster	1965	And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars.	1
ClaimBuster	1966	The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.	1
ClaimBuster	1967	He was a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	1968	And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.	0
ClaimBuster	1969	It's not just movies; television, video games, music, the Internet.	0
ClaimBuster	1970	And I have no apologies for our going on a peace mission.	0
ClaimBuster	1971	I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself.	0
ClaimBuster	1972	A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.	1
ClaimBuster	1973	And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.	0
ClaimBuster	1974	We welcome legal immigrants into this country.	0
ClaimBuster	1975	I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times.	0
ClaimBuster	1976	And while I was there I worked on a bipartisan basis, as I did in the House, I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry.	1
ClaimBuster	1977	The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.	1
ClaimBuster	1978	And plus, we cut taxes for everybody.	1
ClaimBuster	1979	With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.	1
ClaimBuster	1980	He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people.	1
ClaimBuster	1981	He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.	1
ClaimBuster	1982	Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.	1
ClaimBuster	1983	No, I'm not proud of that.	0
ClaimBuster	1984	We've had uh - Republican presidents before who've tried to run against a Democratic - uh Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	1985	I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.	0
ClaimBuster	1986	I think you know because you've covered these issues, that there's no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget.	1
ClaimBuster	1987	"I, I still remember a woman that I met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell, give an answer when they say, ""What does your mother do for a job?"""	1
ClaimBuster	1988	Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.	0
ClaimBuster	1989	Now let me just tell you a little story.	0
ClaimBuster	1990	We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	1991	And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.	1
ClaimBuster	1992	You also have investments outside the United States.	1
ClaimBuster	1993	Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights.	0
ClaimBuster	1994	What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.	0
ClaimBuster	1995	I completely respect their views.	0
ClaimBuster	1996	To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.	0
ClaimBuster	1997	So some may be better off.	0
ClaimBuster	1998	They feel we have to have strong borders.	0
ClaimBuster	1999	Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago.	1
ClaimBuster	2000	You raise taxes and you kill jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2001	I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular.	0
ClaimBuster	2002	That's one major war explosion in a warhead.	0
ClaimBuster	2003	I'd like to thank the hundreds of executives who came to Chicago, a third of them Republicans, who said they wanted to change.	1
ClaimBuster	2004	Well, where are the papers?	0
ClaimBuster	2005	The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2006	We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together.	0
ClaimBuster	2007	Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.	0
ClaimBuster	2008	I love the people here.	0
ClaimBuster	2009	And I don't have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments.	0
ClaimBuster	2010	But it's the right move not to join a foreign court that could -- where our people could be prosecuted.	0
ClaimBuster	2011	Let me come back and -- and answer your question.	0
ClaimBuster	2012	And to this day, not one of its decisions or rulings has ever been challenged.	1
ClaimBuster	2013	I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you.	0
ClaimBuster	2014	Government does not create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2015	In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions.	0
ClaimBuster	2016	You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.	1
ClaimBuster	2017	But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.	0
ClaimBuster	2018	Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations - regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners, and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality our water and our land.	1
ClaimBuster	2019	We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.	1
ClaimBuster	2020	I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.	0
ClaimBuster	2021	Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.	0
ClaimBuster	2022	One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace, quicker.	0
ClaimBuster	2023	We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.	0
ClaimBuster	2024	Doing everything we can to control our own energy.	0
ClaimBuster	2025	Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace.	0
ClaimBuster	2026	An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world.	0
ClaimBuster	2027	And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.	1
ClaimBuster	2028	Because we've got a lot of people advocating we don't want to put our money into Social Security.	0
ClaimBuster	2029	And we got some very good Republican women running.	1
ClaimBuster	2030	And that's why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration.	1
ClaimBuster	2031	And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.	0
ClaimBuster	2032	We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state.	1
ClaimBuster	2033	And in those two cases, I would favor them.	0
ClaimBuster	2034	I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.	0
ClaimBuster	2035	The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality.	0
ClaimBuster	2036	And that means keeping our military strong.	0
ClaimBuster	2037	Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.	0
ClaimBuster	2038	We've got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan.	0
ClaimBuster	2039	First of all, I'm going through from the very beginning -- we're going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military.	0
ClaimBuster	2040	And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.	0
ClaimBuster	2041	And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.	1
ClaimBuster	2042	(LAUGHTER) I am a person who keeps promises.	0
ClaimBuster	2043	I don't think we need 150,000 troops.	0
ClaimBuster	2044	Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.	0
ClaimBuster	2045	I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.	0
ClaimBuster	2046	There's no doubt about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2047	Now look, if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man.	1
ClaimBuster	2048	Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.	0
ClaimBuster	2049	But these are important questions.	0
ClaimBuster	2050	I said they need -- these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy.	0
ClaimBuster	2051	I want to tell her, I'll fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors and fight for the people of this country for a prosperity that benefits all.	0
ClaimBuster	2052	Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?	0
ClaimBuster	2053	I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase.	0
ClaimBuster	2054	I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill.	1
ClaimBuster	2055	We've got to pay our troops more.	0
ClaimBuster	2056	We're going to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	2057	The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.	1
ClaimBuster	2058	This is the fourth time this has happened -- an identical attack, in the same region, despite warnings -- even public warnings -- from the terrorists.	1
ClaimBuster	2059	I support the death penalty.	1
ClaimBuster	2060	They've had eight years to get something done on Medicare.	1
ClaimBuster	2061	I did a study on it; they're cost- ineffective.	1
ClaimBuster	2062	If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law.	0
ClaimBuster	2063	Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do.	1
ClaimBuster	2064	Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.	0
ClaimBuster	2065	So let's just, let's give credit where credit is due.	0
ClaimBuster	2066	Will our children be better off?	0
ClaimBuster	2067	I'm talking about a national mood.	0
ClaimBuster	2068	Once again, the president is misleading America.	0
ClaimBuster	2069	And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.	0
ClaimBuster	2070	First of all, as I say, I don't think that -- we're not going to have another Cold War with Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	2071	Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.	0
ClaimBuster	2072	And I know that everybody uh - makes mistakes.	0
ClaimBuster	2073	Now he did use uh - ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh - does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that's we so badly need as we enter into uh - negotiations uh - under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh - we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh - apologized, uh - would not have justified my asking for his resignation.	1
ClaimBuster	2074	In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests.	0
ClaimBuster	2075	Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator.	0
ClaimBuster	2076	I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.	0
ClaimBuster	2077	That's one of the problems with this administration's so-called shuttle diplomacy.	0
ClaimBuster	2078	I believe that if in all these years that we have spent trying to get the amendment, that we had spent as much time correcting these laws, as we did in California - and we were the first to do it.	0
ClaimBuster	2079	And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.	1
ClaimBuster	2080	I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.	1
ClaimBuster	2081	But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.	1
ClaimBuster	2082	So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.	0
ClaimBuster	2083	That's not how you bring people together.	0
ClaimBuster	2084	That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.	1
ClaimBuster	2085	But let me tell you where the president's policies have put us.	0
ClaimBuster	2086	To me that's how you make society the safest it can be.	0
ClaimBuster	2087	But it's an honor that we have it.	0
ClaimBuster	2088	But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him.	0
ClaimBuster	2089	First of all, I do have mandatory testing.	0
ClaimBuster	2090	Because the question you ask is important.	0
ClaimBuster	2091	How can something this serious occur in an administration and have a President of the United States in a situation like this say he didn't know?	0
ClaimBuster	2092	Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.	1
ClaimBuster	2093	There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.	0
ClaimBuster	2094	The people have to make up their minds.	0
ClaimBuster	2095	Let me restate uh - our policy.	0
ClaimBuster	2096	It just takes - from the people.	0
ClaimBuster	2097	But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.	1
ClaimBuster	2098	And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination.	0
ClaimBuster	2099	So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.	0
ClaimBuster	2100	Because we talked about what we wanted to do.	0
ClaimBuster	2101	And we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it, and you just saw it in response to previous questions.	0
ClaimBuster	2102	I have seen what's happened in this last 4 years when -- in my state, when people lose their jobs there's a good chance I'll know them by their names.	0
ClaimBuster	2103	How -- why would these people stay there?	0
ClaimBuster	2104	For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity.	0
ClaimBuster	2105	We don't want our kids coming back here.	0
ClaimBuster	2106	Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.	0
ClaimBuster	2107	I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge.	0
ClaimBuster	2108	So at least we have time to work with it.	0
ClaimBuster	2109	Over the next four years, we'll continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America.	0
ClaimBuster	2110	You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.	1
ClaimBuster	2111	Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible.	0
ClaimBuster	2112	They have not been forthcoming.	0
ClaimBuster	2113	Let me just answer one part of the last question quickly, and then I'll come to immigration.	0
ClaimBuster	2114	Wanda Blackmore I met here from Missouri, the first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card, she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs.	1
ClaimBuster	2115	That's why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing.	0
ClaimBuster	2116	"I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, ""No controlling legal authority."""	0
ClaimBuster	2117	I will not privatize it.	0
ClaimBuster	2118	I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line.	0
ClaimBuster	2119	I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury by 70 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2120	We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.	0
ClaimBuster	2121	The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired.	1
ClaimBuster	2122	Our inner cities are a disaster.	0
ClaimBuster	2123	That's what a governor gets to do.	1
ClaimBuster	2124	She had a small business with 63 employees.	1
ClaimBuster	2125	When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.	1
ClaimBuster	2126	We can't have any test of race.	0
ClaimBuster	2127	And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.	0
ClaimBuster	2128	They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology.	0
ClaimBuster	2129	The fact-finding committee's powers are limited.	0
ClaimBuster	2130	He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.	1
ClaimBuster	2131	Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.	0
ClaimBuster	2132	In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers.	0
ClaimBuster	2133	We are going to cut taxes massively.	0
ClaimBuster	2134	Oh, you mean the rules.	0
ClaimBuster	2135	I want to bring that change to the American people.	0
ClaimBuster	2136	We've got a plan to do so.	0
ClaimBuster	2137	Thank you very much, Ann.	0
ClaimBuster	2138	The Congress can modify the supply of money by modifying the income uh tax laws.	1
ClaimBuster	2139	The -- the greatest failure we've had with regards to -- to gun violence in some respects is what -- what is known as Fast and Furious.	1
ClaimBuster	2140	Was Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what was the question?	0
ClaimBuster	2141	This doesn't mean that the people aren't going to be paying the bill.	0
ClaimBuster	2142	And, there are eight other categories that should not have guns.	0
ClaimBuster	2143	I'm going to shut that loophole, and I'm going to give the tax benefit to the companies that stay here in America to help make them more competitive.	0
ClaimBuster	2144	What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.	1
ClaimBuster	2145	And everything that I've tried to do, and everything that I'm now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.	0
ClaimBuster	2146	In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy.	0
ClaimBuster	2147	I think we've given the American people back their spirit.	0
ClaimBuster	2148	When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.	0
ClaimBuster	2149	That's going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that.	0
ClaimBuster	2150	I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	2151	"Somebody here asked the question about, ""Why haven't you vetoed something?"""	1
ClaimBuster	2152	Half -- one out of two of the full-time college students in the United States are receiving some form of Federal aid.	1
ClaimBuster	2153	The president did not do what was necessary.	0
ClaimBuster	2154	And I would say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement.	0
ClaimBuster	2155	And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care.	1
ClaimBuster	2156	I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.	0
ClaimBuster	2157	I'm trying to decipher that.	0
ClaimBuster	2158	So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.	0
ClaimBuster	2159	I apologize to my family.	0
ClaimBuster	2160	Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.	1
ClaimBuster	2161	We're going to do that with regulatory reform.	0
ClaimBuster	2162	One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.	1
ClaimBuster	2163	Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.	1
ClaimBuster	2164	He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.	1
ClaimBuster	2165	With the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didn't use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the world's number one criminal and terrorist.	1
ClaimBuster	2166	The president mentioned that you need the right person in a crisis.	1
ClaimBuster	2167	So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.	1
ClaimBuster	2168	This will give them availability.	0
ClaimBuster	2169	The governor, if it's a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school.	1
ClaimBuster	2170	I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.	0
ClaimBuster	2171	And he drew up this manual.	1
ClaimBuster	2172	He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed.	1
ClaimBuster	2173	But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.	0
ClaimBuster	2174	This is obviously a very tender topic.	0
ClaimBuster	2175	He's great as a -- as a -- as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.	0
ClaimBuster	2176	We do and I hope...	0
ClaimBuster	2177	I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.	0
ClaimBuster	2178	That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.	1
ClaimBuster	2179	And, by the way, I like coal.	0
ClaimBuster	2180	We're doing better than a lot of the countries in the world.	1
ClaimBuster	2181	The reason I bring that up is because he's proposed $2.2 trillion in new spending, and he says he going to tax the rich to close the tax gap.	1
ClaimBuster	2182	Our country's in deep trouble.	0
ClaimBuster	2183	And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.	0
ClaimBuster	2184	We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2185	Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don't quite square with the record.	0
ClaimBuster	2186	I did support it at the time.	1
ClaimBuster	2187	That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.	0
ClaimBuster	2188	So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.	0
ClaimBuster	2189	And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.	0
ClaimBuster	2190	But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.	0
ClaimBuster	2191	(Laughter) Now, that's your tax money being wasted.	0
ClaimBuster	2192	And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.	1
ClaimBuster	2193	It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color.	0
ClaimBuster	2194	So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.	1
ClaimBuster	2195	But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.	0
ClaimBuster	2196	Another thing is to deal with our - uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don't speak English, or who're black, or young people, or - 40 percent of the employment.	1
ClaimBuster	2197	I'm sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected.	0
ClaimBuster	2198	I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.	0
ClaimBuster	2199	I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.	1
ClaimBuster	2200	That's why Senator Lugar says: incompetent in the delivery of services.	1
ClaimBuster	2201	Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.	0
ClaimBuster	2202	And don't take my word for it.	0
ClaimBuster	2203	Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent.	1
ClaimBuster	2204	And it's one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America.	1
ClaimBuster	2205	America remains the one indispensable nation.	0
ClaimBuster	2206	Government does not create jobs.	0
ClaimBuster	2207	You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.	1
ClaimBuster	2208	And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.	0
ClaimBuster	2209	I have described what has happened in Iran, and we weren't here then either.	0
ClaimBuster	2210	I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.	0
ClaimBuster	2211	And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.	0
ClaimBuster	2212	But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.	0
ClaimBuster	2213	But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.	0
ClaimBuster	2214	We had 7 billion this year and 10 billion more than the president.	1
ClaimBuster	2215	We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.	0
ClaimBuster	2216	And give us a plan.	0
ClaimBuster	2217	We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.	0
ClaimBuster	2218	The harder you work, the more you can keep.	0
ClaimBuster	2219	And we've been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices.	0
ClaimBuster	2220	I think it's the hard-working people of America's money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families.	0
ClaimBuster	2221	We knew he tortured his own people.	1
ClaimBuster	2222	It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America.	1
ClaimBuster	2223	But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income.	0
ClaimBuster	2224	And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.	1
ClaimBuster	2225	What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important.	0
ClaimBuster	2226	And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.	0
ClaimBuster	2227	Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.	0
ClaimBuster	2228	And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.	0
ClaimBuster	2229	But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.	1
ClaimBuster	2230	The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty.	1
ClaimBuster	2231	So health care needs to be affordable and available.	0
ClaimBuster	2232	Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.	0
ClaimBuster	2233	Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear.	0
ClaimBuster	2234	Then, if the plans are huge and complex like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs.	0
ClaimBuster	2235	It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.	0
ClaimBuster	2236	And I've said mistakes were made.	0
ClaimBuster	2237	"""Oops, we haven't done the job."	0
ClaimBuster	2238	And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.	1
ClaimBuster	2239	It wasn't failing to serve.	0
ClaimBuster	2240	It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.	0
ClaimBuster	2241	I don't have an indoor gymnasium and an indoor tennis and an indoor every other thing they can think of; I don't have a place where I can go make free TV to send to my constituents to try to brainwash them to elect me the next time.	1
ClaimBuster	2242	I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.	0
ClaimBuster	2243	That, I think, is a good balance.	0
ClaimBuster	2244	You don't turn national security into a political issue.	0
ClaimBuster	2245	I think that it basically has fallen.	0
ClaimBuster	2246	It had everything to do with energy.	0
ClaimBuster	2247	The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason.	1
ClaimBuster	2248	We're not allowed to vote on it.	1
ClaimBuster	2249	The trillion comes from the surplus.	1
ClaimBuster	2250	I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985.	1
ClaimBuster	2251	Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too.	1
ClaimBuster	2252	There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.	1
ClaimBuster	2253	We've got a plan in place.	1
ClaimBuster	2254	That I can tell you.	0
ClaimBuster	2255	And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.	0
ClaimBuster	2256	But it's gonna require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done.	0
ClaimBuster	2257	How did we do that?	0
ClaimBuster	2258	I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.	0
ClaimBuster	2259	We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.	0
ClaimBuster	2260	Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.	1
ClaimBuster	2261	Here's some thing that'll help.	0
ClaimBuster	2262	In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.	1
ClaimBuster	2263	That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.	0
ClaimBuster	2264	"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan."	0
ClaimBuster	2265	And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs.	0
ClaimBuster	2266	And we've got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries.	0
ClaimBuster	2267	I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2268	I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.	0
ClaimBuster	2269	Her husband PJ got killed.	1
ClaimBuster	2270	And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.	0
ClaimBuster	2271	And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.	0
ClaimBuster	2272	Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my state also should count for something.	0
ClaimBuster	2273	I think it's very important that we reform our entitlement programs.	0
ClaimBuster	2274	But I do not want to go the tax-and-spend route.	0
ClaimBuster	2275	That will not help us compete with China.	0
ClaimBuster	2276	In 1977, we took that away from the military.	1
ClaimBuster	2277	I appreciate their idealism, their sacrifices.	0
ClaimBuster	2278	And I also think that we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.	0
ClaimBuster	2279	Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.	0
ClaimBuster	2280	Now, like uh - any hardworking uh - person seeking public office uh - in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh - rather graphic language and I'm guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.	0
ClaimBuster	2281	I think you'll find somebody who might interest you.	0
ClaimBuster	2282	And we need to reform.	0
ClaimBuster	2283	We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it.	1
ClaimBuster	2284	And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.	1
ClaimBuster	2285	I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.	0
ClaimBuster	2286	I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.	0
ClaimBuster	2287	Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states.	1
ClaimBuster	2288	Oscar, the question of what the federal government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me.	1
ClaimBuster	2289	And that's the budget that we've put forward.	0
ClaimBuster	2290	I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.	0
ClaimBuster	2291	And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.	0
ClaimBuster	2292	Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it:.	1
ClaimBuster	2293	It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.	1
ClaimBuster	2294	And look at her website.	0
ClaimBuster	2295	All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government.	1
ClaimBuster	2296	But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.	0
ClaimBuster	2297	And finally, I do believe in tax relief.	0
ClaimBuster	2298	He said if affirmative action means quotas, he's against it.	1
ClaimBuster	2299	When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.	0
ClaimBuster	2300	I believe that we should defend Formosa.	0
ClaimBuster	2301	But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure.	0
ClaimBuster	2302	John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.	1
ClaimBuster	2303	And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.	1
ClaimBuster	2304	There's only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me.	1
ClaimBuster	2305	The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy.	0
ClaimBuster	2306	And I'm going to lead those troops to victory.	0
ClaimBuster	2307	We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.	0
ClaimBuster	2308	You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.	0
ClaimBuster	2309	Of course, the U.N. was invited in.	1
ClaimBuster	2310	And we have a very good fight.	0
ClaimBuster	2311	Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.	1
ClaimBuster	2312	I would have put them in place earlier.	0
ClaimBuster	2313	I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.	0
ClaimBuster	2314	So we're making progress but until we get that one done, we're not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem.	0
ClaimBuster	2315	I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.	0
ClaimBuster	2316	First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing.	0
ClaimBuster	2317	I'd just like to respond.	0
ClaimBuster	2318	We are now $120 billion of imports, 3 million jobs lost, and farmers are having their worst year.	1
ClaimBuster	2319	Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.	0
ClaimBuster	2320	And I just want to make one thing very clear.	0
ClaimBuster	2321	We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy.	0
ClaimBuster	2322	"When he said, ""We're going to repeal Obamacare."	0
ClaimBuster	2323	Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.	0
ClaimBuster	2324	I got lots of relatives and they're good, average, middle-class, hardworking Americans.	1
ClaimBuster	2325	Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.	0
ClaimBuster	2326	The question is, was this wise?	0
ClaimBuster	2327	He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace.	0
ClaimBuster	2328	We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.	1
ClaimBuster	2329	President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well.	1
ClaimBuster	2330	It means -- and I have to, again, repeat this.	0
ClaimBuster	2331	He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.	1
ClaimBuster	2332	He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government.	0
ClaimBuster	2333	Democrats or Republicans, it will be preserved.	0
ClaimBuster	2334	The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesn't go just to the few.	0
ClaimBuster	2335	Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan.	1
ClaimBuster	2336	It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America.	0
ClaimBuster	2337	Why did she delete 33,000...	0
ClaimBuster	2338	We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.	0
ClaimBuster	2339	I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.	0
ClaimBuster	2340	If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.	1
ClaimBuster	2341	I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.	0
ClaimBuster	2342	And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.	1
ClaimBuster	2343	And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be.	0
ClaimBuster	2344	When you announce that you're going to launch an attack into another country, it's pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us.	0
ClaimBuster	2345	On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.	0
ClaimBuster	2346	And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.	0
ClaimBuster	2347	I've got a plan to control health care costs.	0
ClaimBuster	2348	First of all, we didn't find out he didn't have weapons until we got there, and my opponent thought he had weapons and told everybody he thought he had weapons.	1
ClaimBuster	2349	We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.	0
ClaimBuster	2350	I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.	0
ClaimBuster	2351	What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.	1
ClaimBuster	2352	I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.	0
ClaimBuster	2353	By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.	0

OC	2863	haha someone did today . 	0
OC	2864	I have this FEELING . 	0
OC	2865	I think that everything will be ok . . . 	1
OC	2866	I guess I felt pretty jaded about this film before I saw it , less so now that I ' ve seen it . . . but I wasn ' t jaded because I ' m just some cynical , bitter queen : I ' m jaded partly because I see the potential for something even MORE wonderful than this film . 	0
OC	2867	And I hear that same longing in the word of a lot of the other queens out there who are taken as " bitter . " 	0
OC	2868	I can see that way of responding to it ; I was more aware of the differences , and a little more aware that , as painful as some of my own life was in the past , I live a much better life now . 	0
OC	2869	And like furr_a_bruin , I ' m ready to see films where the men lead lives a little more like the ones some of us really do get to live these days . 	0
OC	2870	Whereas Alan was reminded of how he felt isolated and didn ' t even realize that when he was in college in Indiana in the early 1970s , there were gay bars all over Indianapolis where he could have gone . 	0
OC	2871	If we take this story personally as a comment on how much the world hasn ' t changed for gay and bi men , or as a look at a common history many of us share , I think it works a lot better . 	0
OC	2872	Much of the progress in our world as gay and bi men has happened because men dared to keep at those kinds of dreams . 	0
OC	2873	I also have to say , I ' m always SO uncomfortable when gay men call each other " jaded queens " over their disagreements . 	0
OC	2874	I agree that it ' s not all that likely that Hollywood will want to make such films any time soon , but the fact that I have big dreams is NOT a flaw in me , or in anyone else . 	1
OC	2875	It just means we have dreams and needs that can ' t always get met right now . 	0
OC	2876	Sorry you can ' t make it , but , yes , there will be others . 	0

OC	2881	I think I need to spend less time worrying about wasting time : ) 	0
OC	2882	Even if every state has this , that ' s still 50 individuals who think they ' re in charge . 	0
OC	2883	If you make one national organization , there ' s ONE person who thinks he ' s in charge . 	0
OC	2884	One person who can become a power-hungry maniac and screw over everyone . 	0
OC	2885	Her feelings about me have never ever been clear . 	0
OC	2886	I never knew if she was just joking around , or whatever . 	0

OC	2888	Maybe it was -his - fantasy ? 	0
OC	2889	His girlfriend making out with another female ? 	0
OC	2890	Or maybe she really is genuine ? 	0
OC	2891	Whatever , it ' s all too confusing . 	0

OC	2940	Passionate architects gave us buildings like the Eiffel Tower , the Washington Monument and the Empire State Building . 	0
OC	2941	But my main objection to the story seems to me to be this basic structural element - passion is a dynamic , driving force and in Brokeback Mountain it just . . . does nothing . 	0
OC	2942	Perhaps there ' s some personalization sneaking in here - I may not be entirely objective . 	0

OC	2964	otherwise , yeah , chicagOOO . 	0
OC	2965	is that one of those bad guys from digdug ? 	0
OC	2966	I think people are responding strongly to the story partly because of something envirobear said earlier in this thread : " The story . . . is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself . " 	1
OC	2967	I think a lot of us are seeing this movie through the lens of our own experiences , and it ' s feeling intensely personal because we line the pain the characters feel up with whatever we ' ve been through that feels similar and was painful at the time . 	0
OC	2968	To me , it ' s the film ' s biggest strength AND greatest weakness . 	0
OC	2969	I got into a bit of an argument with my own partner last night , because he was telling me about how " this is the story that a lot of gay and bi men still live and struggle with , " and I was saying , " Well , yes , I ' m sure it is , but not exactly , and the differences may be important , and maybe we shouldn ' t overpersonalize this . " 	0
OC	2970	I mean , I actually did live in Wyoming in the late 1980s , a few years after this film ends . 	0
OC	2971	catalina = yes . 	0
OC	2972	They also told us not to get caught at the gay bars in Denver . 	0
OC	2973	Which is to say , by the time I lived in Wyoming , twenty years after the characters in the film were that age , we had words like " gay " and concepts like " gay bar , " even if they were two hours away and sounded scary . 	0
OC	2974	I was closeted , felt isolated , and dated a couple of women . . . but even in 1985 , I was vaguely aware that there were other options . 	0
OC	2975	Now in 2005 , the options are even greater , even if the isolation and depression and feelings of entrapment still hit a lot of us . 	0

OC	3076	Leaving the argument about the words " gay " or " love " out of this , clearly there ' s supposed to be a great deal of passion here - hence the bit about " a force of nature " in the advertising for the movie . 	0

OC	3123	. 	0
OC	3124	The core of where I was going definitionally was the difference in approach - from my reading thus far , the question , " by what means can we best achieve our goals ? " seems to be the main way in which " schools " of feminism split off from each other ( first-wave example : the suffragists and those who focused on equality in educational opportunities [ educationalists ? ? ] ) 	0
OC	3125	I don ' t consider " Marxist " to be part of the definition , nor even " collectivist-socialist " - that bit was more a reflection on how , and in what part of the zeitgeist of the times , radical feminism did much of its developing . 	0
OC	3126	Yup , I ' ve been talking about the " different jurisdictions , different conditions " thing all along ( and was pleased to read your German example - I know very little about how it works in countries other than Canada and the US ) . 	1

VG	3198	R that militarily they are unusable , they do not contribute to our security this would change the nature of the debate internationally . 	0
VG	3199	R Well history s shown that when certain countries come to conclusion that certain weapons which may have a military utility like landmines or like cluster bombs but which are deemed to be inhumane , that we we have , have come to recognise because of their indiscriminate effects on civilians and so on , are inhumane . 	0
VG	3200	This is your aspiration , this is your hope that Iran or whoever Korea , would take notice , but you have no evidence of that at all . 	0
VG	3201	MP Here we have a situation where Iran is trying to get the bomb . 	0
VG	3202	That when a certain number of countries renounce them and then crossover to the other side and use their , their knowledge and skills of those technologies to promote the disarmament for everybody they can have really powerful effects . 	0

VG	3210	Not even did the blessed Biblical prophets , nor Jesus himself change the behavior of a people so steeped in immorality and idolatry . 	0
VG	3211	Now , something has to accomodate for this . 	0
VG	3212	If we were to take a look at Arabia before and after the coming of Muhammad , we would see two completely different societies . 	0
VG	3213	So this is my ' Problem of Muhammad ' , or ' Problem of Islam ' . 	0
VG	3214	They knew because of his outstanding moral character , and from his trustworthy personality 	0
VG	3215	They as well , believed with all their hearts that this man , whom they slept with , whom they ate with and whom they fought with , was in fact recieving Revelation from GOD . 	1
VG	3216	But , what is different between Muhammad and other perported figures who claimed Divine Revelation , were those who were closest to him . 	0
VG	3217	So , if Muhammad exhibited such outstanding moral characteristics that those who were not close to him would come to believe that he was always a trustworthy and honourable person , and that they would have no reason to disbelieve in his claim of Divine Revelation . 	0

VG	3219	Perhaps the House would just pause for a moment to contemplate losing the most important source of support that we rely on , certainly when we are young our parents , one or both . 	1
VG	3220	Twelve million children have lost one or both of their parents to AIDS . 	1
VG	3221	To make matters worse , that number is estimated to become a staggering 18 million children by 2010 . 	0
VG	3222	Think of all those children who are growing up without the care of a mother or father . 	0
VG	3223	If there is one thing that we as parents fear more than anything else it is that our children will die before we do , because that is not how it is meant to be ; it is not in the natural order of things . 	0
VG	3224	One of the consequences is that an entire generation of grandparents now have to look after an entire generation of their grandchildren , because the generation in between their children ' s generation is in the process of dying . 	0

VG	3226	Given human freedom , God cannot guarantee how people are going to use that freedom . 	0
VG	3227	And if He intervenes every time to prevent people from choosing evil , then we turn into puppets or marionettes . 	0
VG	3228	Secondly , if God is all-powerful , can He in fact create a world of free creatures in which no harm occurs ? 	0
VG	3229	I think this is clearly not necessarily true . 	0
VG	3230	And therefore he hasn ' t been able to prove that harm and God are logically incompatible . 	1
VG	3231	http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/corey_washington/craig-washington/washington1.html 	0
VG	3232	So if God is going to create a world of significantly free moral agents , He has to allow them to make choices for evil , and therefore it may not be within God ' s power to create a world of free creatures in which evil does not exist . 	0

VG	3234	But the truth appears to be far more mundane . 	0
VG	3235	Multiple Wits sources of varied ideological and other hues say that signs emerged very early in Reid Birley ' s tenure that she was extraordinarily difficult to work with and that the unanimous initial goodwill towards her steadily dissipated among those who had to interact with her daily . 	0
VG	3236	We report this week that senior Wits academics , whom we name with their permission and whose own transformation and gender credentials are impeccable , despairingly recount that Reid Birley repeatedly rejected long-term attempts at constructive intervention . 	0
VG	3237	It is also a matter of record that two very senior managers , recruited from an historically disadvantaged university and who can scarcely be said to be anti-transformation reactionaries , have distanced themselves from Reid Birley . 	0
VG	3238	With such considerations in mind , it is difficult to understand Reid Birley ' s claims that allegations against her are without substance . 	1
VG	3239	Clearly , a crisis had been building up for many months ; equally clearly , Wits needed to act urgently to resolve it . 	0
VG	3240	That when a certain number of countries renounce them and then crossover to the other side and use their , their knowledge and skills of those technologies to promote the disarmament for everybody they can have really powerful effects . 	0
VG	3241	And when that day comes , the bitterness and burning hatreds that feed terrorism will fade and die away . 	0
VG	3242	America and all the world will be safer when hope has returned to the Middle East http://www.bushcountry.org/bush_speeches/president_bush_speech_052504.htm 	0
VG	3243	We believe it is a tragedy of history that in the Middle East - - which gave the world great gifts of law and science and faith - - so many have been held back by lawless tyranny and fanaticism . 	0
VG	3244	R Well history s shown that when certain countries come to conclusion that certain weapons which may have a military utility like landmines or like cluster bombs but which are deemed to be inhumane , that we we have , have come to recognise because of their indiscriminate effects on civilians and so on , are inhumane . 	0
VG	3245	This is your aspiration , this is your hope that Iran or whoever Korea , would take notice , but you have no evidence of that at all . 	0
VG	3246	MP Here we have a situation where Iran is trying to get the bomb . 	0
VG	3247	How would you know that to be the case ? 	0
VG	3248	If we were to get rid of Trident are you saying that you would be absolutely certain that Iran would no longer be developing its nuclear weapon ? 	0
VG	3249	R It s a process . 	0
VG	3250	R You cannot know that that s the case but you can look back but you MP Would it not be the most unconscionable risk to take ? 	0
VG	3251	We can test the water , begin to take this step in a context where the President of the United States , President Obama has said that he also wants to move towards a world free of nuclear weapons . 	0

WTP	3791	In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . which brings the reliably cited accusations and refutations simply ; not imposing one reliable sources view over the other , and leave further discussion to the child article per summary style . 	0

WTP	3813	Consensus is usually sufficient to remove the tag , but consensus isn ' t necessary to put it there in the first place ; indeed , it ' s usually a lack of consensus that leads editors to tag an article . 	0
WTP	3814	It is uncollaborative to remove a tag without discussion [ 2 ] and for invalid reasons ( like " no consensus to include " ) [ 3 ] . 	0
WTP	3815	Yes , of course it should . 	0
WTP	3816	That ' s the whole purpose of tags : to flag articles so that fresh input can be obtained . 	0
WTP	3817	Obviously , a tag need not be kept if it ' s clearly frivolous , but that ' s not the case here . 	0
WTP	3818	While I think the tag should remain until agreement is reached , I personally don ' t share Levine2112 ' s concerns about NPOV in this case . 	1
WTP	3819	If some editors don ' t think there are NPOV problems , then the venue for expressing that is to use this talk page , not to remove the tag . 	0
WTP	3820	The same logic applies for , e . g , article RfC ' s or noticeboard postings : we don ' t just delete them because we disagree with them . 	0
WTP	3821	Only the controversy over whether or not Wiki considers System of a Down nu metal , I think . 	0
WTP	3822	Personally , I don ' t really consider them nu metal at this point , and our article on them lists them as alternative metal . 	0
WTP	3823	Then you haven ' t viewed the latest UN report that asserts that Israeli soldiers deliberately attacked civilian targets in Gaza war . 	0

WTP	3826	The point is here , WP : TERRORIST policy is clear , because usually there is in the story more than " someone is a terrorist " . 	0

WTP	3828	It is already mentioned in the lead that many countries consider Hamas to be a terrorist organization and no one has objected to that , I don ' t understand why you are pushing now for this statement in the first lines of the article . 	0

WTP	3865	If it isn ' t , then the source is only presenting its opinion ( or in this case , characterization ) . 	0
WTP	3866	And if we are going to allow characterizations made by sources which don ' t represent the scientific community in general but kind of slant towards that way , then we also have to include characterizations made by sources which slant the other way . 	0
WTP	3867	I think some editors only want to include sources which are generally regarded as trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	3868	If that were the case , this article would only include items which are definitively pseudoscientific per the scientific community in general ; for if a source is truly trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience , then it speaks for scientific community in general . 	1
WTP	3869	The sources which we choose should be trustworthy / authoritative in presenting the sources characterization . 	0
WTP	3870	I think there might be confusion here . 	0
WTP	3871	@Eldereft . 	0
WTP	3872	Per your point - " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " - remember that the subject at hand is not pseudoscience but rather the characterization of such . 	0
WTP	3873	Essentially , this could be a black-and-white article where we only present items which are definitively pseuodscience per the scientific community in general . 	0
WTP	3874	But once we allow " characterizations " in this article , it ceases to be black-and-white , but rather a range of gray . 	0

WTP	3980	This is the text of that contribution : Despite this , The Gap has received mounting criticism over working conditions in its factories . 	1
WTP	3981	During the spring of 2003 The Gap , along with 21 other companies , was involved in a class action lawsuit filed by sweatshop workers in Saipan . 	0
WTP	3982	The allegations included " off the clock " hours , where workers were not paid for working overtime , unsafe working conditions , and forced abortion policies . 	0
WTP	3983	If you want add links for other large scale operations , then that would also be relevant for the lead ( and improve the article without using up any more than a few additional words ) . 	0
WTP	3984	The addition consists of only three words and it makes the article more comprehensive and relevant . 	0
WTP	3985	The number of casualties is one of the best measures for judging the scale of a war ( since statistics like this are more objective and verifiable than questions of " historical significance " ect ) . 	1
WTP	3986	The fact that , as you say , it ' s been re-added about 50 times , shows that the wikipedia consensus is that it stay . 	0

WTP	4007	I removed it because it is redundant , mentioned already 2 paragraphs above in the Bronner quote . 	0

WTP	4018	I view " Christian church " as being simply more specific and accurate than " faith " in this instance . 	0
WTP	4019	So far as the verbosity goes , I think I used too many words , but I ' d still much rather have a more accurate description than some mushy , touchy-feely prose that uses that wretched word , " community " . 	0
WTP	4020	San Francisco does function to some extent as a refuge for LGBT folks , with protections codified into law and an implicit understanding that things like gay-bashing are not tolerated there , so perhaps it does merit mention in the lead . 	0
WTP	4021	Probably true of Boston as well , but in SF ' s case , the city is seen as a " gay " city , much more so than , say , New York is known as a " Jewish " city ( pace Jesse Jackson ' s unfortunate remarks ) . 	0
WTP	4022	Point taken about New York and Jews ; in defense , I ' d say the difference here is that the perceived ( and actual ) character of San Francisco is more inextricably bound up with its larger-than-average share of gay , lesbian , etc . , people . 	0

WTP	4035	It is much more than this and pretending that it can be called , in its entirety , a " terrorist organization " is nonsense . 	0
WTP	4036	Responsible sources dont focus on just the military wing of Hamas , which has admittedly carried out attacks classified as " terrorist " . 	0
WTP	4037	It is much less clear cut than calling the Irgun a " terrorist organization " , and we dont do that . 	0

WTP	4043	I removed the section that said ( to effect ) that there was a possibility that a female US President could opt to be her own First Lady . 	0
WTP	4044	I also eliminated some of the text regarding First Gentleman , which is purely speculative and thus innaproriate for this article . 	0
WTP	4045	But if someone wants to remove aspects of this , I have a hard time imagining it will be as responsible a representation of what is left , and I ' d like to see these points addressed , not just undertaken . 	0
WTP	4046	I think the whole section should be deleted from this bio entirely and moved to Presidency , and would applaud consensus to do so . 	0
WTP	4047	I ' m not saying what I wrote can ' t be improved upon , I ' m saying removing points currently for the sole purpose of making it shorter , if it then makes it lopsided , is not the answer here . 	0

WTP	4049	Should it say he was deciding between competing " Christian sects " , or is " Christian churches " accurate enough ? 	0
WTP	4050	In his histories , he speaks of trying to decide between various " sects " that had varying interpretations of the Bible . 	0
WTP	4051	I ' ve changed the language that Smith prayed to find out what " faith " to join to read that he prayed which " Christian church " to join . 	0
WTP	4052	He was not asking God which of all the world ' s religions to join — he was asking God which Christian church he should join . 	1
WTP	4053	It is non-controversial that Smith was a Christian at the time of the First Vision , is it not ? 	0
WTP	4054	But I do think it is disproportionate to mention the abuse scandal in Australia , Canada , Ireland , Mexico , Poland and the United Kingdom , the large financial settlements in Ireland , the number of high ranking prelates who were involved , the affect on the Catholic faithful in Ireland and Poland and the actual number of the victims of the abusers including the methodology for determining the actual numbers . 	0
WTP	4055	Am I an editor refusing to allow " any mention " of it in the article ? 	1
WTP	4056	No . 	1
WTP	4057	Wassap , I don ' t see NPOV violations so much as an attempt to keep it short . 	1
WTP	4058	The three reasons for keeping the sex abuse section short are : it has its own article , and to make it longer violates WP : Undue Weight and WP : recentism . 	0
WTP	4059	I was in favour of your proposed wording , I said so unambiguously ! 	0
WTP	4060	I can ' t imagine more than three US citizens liking " First Master " , and newspapers would have a field day . 	0
WTP	4061	The choice of term is politically touchy , and the female candidate ' s team will have chosen and popularized the " best " one , for instance by mentioning it casually on morning talk shows , well before the nominating convention so that it doesn ' t become a campaign issue . 	0
WTP	4062	The word " Lady " in " First Lady " comes from her social role , and hence " First Master " , although doubtful , is possible . 	0
WTP	4063	" First Husband " has also been hypothesized , although the article does not propose it . 	0
WTP	4064	It isn ' t an issue of peerage , it is a question of social etiquette . 	1
WTP	4065	" Lady of the House " and " Master of the House ' are phrases used in etiquette handbooks to decribe the hostess and host of a social occasion . 	0
WTP	4066	It is not principally to reflect sectional press-led emphasis on a US scandal , which in fact shows that Catholic priests have been accused of abuse at about the same rate as those of any other denomination or secular profession . 	1

WTP	4093	It looks like a gallery the World Book encyclopedia might have at the end of an article . 	0
WTP	4094	What occurs to me is that the photos are all fairly positive towards the IDF and for someone looking to see the subject as the subject might present itself , these images do a fair job . 	0
WTP	4095	I would say that inclusion in this gallery , which closes a long and detailed article ( with many links to main articles ) should be given the following test : If this gallery was as the end of the article on the Danish military , would you keep it ? 	1

WTP	4203	Ehh . . . while technically true , I never , for one minute , believed he was including sin taxes in that too . 	0
WTP	4204	Politifact , as well , were debating on whether sin taxes counted . 	0
WTP	4205	However , I ' d personally rate the promise broken , because of the insurance mandate , as the administration are defending it as a tax now . 	0

WTP	4240	" Black Sabbath are arguably the most influential heavy metal band of all time . 	0
WTP	4241	Maybe you recall correctly , maybe not , you don ' t know , " Alright , let me go read that section again . 	0
WTP	4242	You are clearly not a credible agent in this discussion about Black Sabbath , which you admit here . 	0
WTP	4243	" You ramble , man . 	0
WTP	4244	That was oddly phrased . 	0
WTP	4245	" Call it prejudice , but do you dedicated wiki editors develop some kind of deep-rooted persistence to something that is backed by common knowledge and opinion , shared by , what you call , reliable sources alike ? " 	0
WTP	4246	In fact , in the next sentence , it mentions that Time Magazine called Paranoid the " birthplace of heavy metal , " which is pure hype . 	0
WTP	4247	The band helped to create the genre with ground breaking releases such as Paranoid , an album that Rolling Stone magazine said " changed music forever " , and called the band " the Beatles of heavy metal " . " This paragraph is rightfully phrased as representation of an opinion . 	0
WTP	4248	It is also not common knowledge that Sabbath " invented " metal ; that is simply incorrect , and at best a common misconception . 	0
WTP	4249	If you ' re saying what I think you ' re saying , then no . 	0

WTP	4251	It will make this article richer and abide better with the three core content policies - especially WP : NPOV . 	0
WTP	4252	Remember , this article attempts to " tell the story " of topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	4253	I think we should still include historical characterizations , but make it clear that the characterization is historical . 	1
WTP	4254	If a topic was once characterized as a pseudoscience by some notable source but later called a science by the same or other notable source , let ' s provide all of the details . 	0

WTP	4262	The why is what I ' m most interested in , and I hope you can dig up some information to add into the article so we can further elaborate on this topic , as its much needed in the body on the article . 	0
WTP	4263	The second set of statements , if they belong anywhere , would make most sense in an article on LBGT politics or sociology . 	0
WTP	4264	The first kind of statement arguably might belong in the lead of the SF article . 	0
WTP	4265	However , a great many people will argue with the statements that 1 ) SF is a " haven for LGBT , " and that 2 ) this is a defining characteristic of the city . 	1
WTP	4266	No one will argue with the fact that SF is known for its large LBGT population . 	0
WTP	4267	It ' s best to leave the lead as it is now . - - 	0
WTP	4268	Finally , the second set of statements is tarnished with POV and is almost impossible to back up with an unbiased verifiable source . 	0
WTP	4269	I will do that and attempt to squish into the arbitrary " 4 " paragraphs ; feel free to revert , undo , or re-edit . 	0
WTP	4270	I certainly agree on the previous names ; not needed in intro . 	0

WTP	4273	Haven ' t read the whole article thoroughly yet , but looking over it , it ' s pretty clear that ( a ) the whole Popper-evolution issue is far more complicated than I had realised , and ( b ) using Popper as a source for a claim that evolution is pseudoscience isn ' t appropriate . 	0

WTP	4280	Obviously Duffy does not offer the reader any historical document to discredit Irenaeus , its just his opinion that its " suspiciously tidy " . 	0
WTP	4281	Xandar , Eamon Duffy is a most respected historian whose opinion can and will be brought up by those who will call our article a POV if we dont present his view in equal proportion to the Roman Catholic Church view supported by the historian Edward Norman . 	0
WTP	4282	Is that right ? - - 	0
WTP	4283	The source of the original controversy is a translation made by government funded sources , so we ' re looking to sources outside of the government now to clarify and verify . 	0

WTP	4289	I - for one - do not think this article is NPOV . 	1
WTP	4290	I think it is tightly POV in reference to the Catholic Church and is not a 360 degree view of the Church . 	0

WTP	4293	And Zeppelin III ' s current five stars from Allmusicgiude ( wikipedia ' s biggest misplaced trust ) is pure hype , as we all know . 	0
WTP	4294	Same goes for Led Zeppelin III ; it has always been seen as a relative downfall in the middle of Zeppelin II and Zeppelin IV , which were hailed from the start . 	0
WTP	4295	Maybe Grand Funk Railroad were reviled because they never were any good ? 	0
WTP	4296	You fail to see the essence of what I ' m stating , Albert . 	0
WTP	4297	Even now , in retrospect , they aren ' t hailed or remembered as innovators , by anyone . 	0
WTP	4298	Thought of that ? 	0
WTP	4299	Do I need to say that a smug-faced editor came and rejected everything with wikipedian policy and subtle insults that commented on my " regrettable " wikipedia history ? 	0
WTP	4300	I actually commented , just recently , on the Zeppelin article , where I criticized its overuse of reliance on Rolling Stone Magazine ; it practically bases its whole introduction with hails from that tacky magazine that includes 20 Beatles albums in its top 10 of the greatest albums ever . 	0
WTP	4301	What I added later was that , as an Israeli and army veteran , it ' s easy to notice a few more details that identify the event better than a foreigner would . 	0
WTP	4302	That was exactly my point ! 	0
WTP	4303	I fully support removing this picture from this article . 	0
WTP	4304	However , this is not relevant to the article , and constitutes original research . 	0
WTP	4305	— 	0
WTP	4306	I didn ' t remove it for it not being unreliable , though I understand that aspect . 	0
WTP	4307	I do not consider that this gallery " adds to the reader ' s understanding of the " IDF by " illustrat [ ing ] aspects of [ the ] subject that cannot be easily or adequately described by text or individual images . " 	0
WTP	4308	The images in the gallery collectively must have encyclopedic value and add to the reader ' s understanding of the subject . 	0
WTP	4309	From WP : IG : However , the use of galleries ( usually by way of the gallery tag or gallery template ) may be appropriate in Wikipedia articles where a collection of images can illustrate aspects of a subject that cannot be easily or adequately described by text or individual images . 	0
WTP	4310	Oh , I don ' t anything about that noticeboard . 	0
WTP	4311	But get rid of the gallery . 	0
WTP	4312	Obviously , if there is a large chunk of unadorned text , you can put a relevant image there . 	0
WTP	4313	I ' ve given options for using some of your favourite images - replace the less useful existing ones . 	0
WTP	4314	So the gallery should be scrapped . 	0
WTP	4315	I guess you don ' t approve of a source that is geared to young adults like those who attend Universities ? 	0
WTP	4316	> The rewrite makes the sentence incorrect . 	0
WTP	4317	The part about Protestant propaganda per my source was that the two brutal non-church initiated or controlled inquisitions of Philip IV of France and Spanish Inquisition was used by Protestants to demonize the Catholic Church for centuries . 	0
WTP	4318	I do not agree that the paragraph should have been changed to eliminate this fact . 	0
WTP	4319	The Spanish Inquisition was the worst of them all and executed many people 3-4000 per my source . 	0
WTP	4320	I disagree with the change also , I left a note on Xandars page . 	1
WTP	4321	As the user also noted in their recent edits , the medical consensus on the issue is that HIV does cause AIDS . 	0
WTP	4322	The lead was recently changed by User : Neuromancer to indicate that the causative role of HIV in AIDS isn ' t proven ( see diff ) . 	1
WTP	4323	Thus I think adding a caveat about the unproven nature of HIV ' s causative role in AIDS isn ' t just an example of undue weight , but is furthermore incorrect . 	1
WTP	4324	To my understanding , if medical consensus supports some hypothesis based on verifying experiments and overwhelming amounts of empirical evidence , then that notion is considered a scientific fact . 	0
WTP	4325	Based on that rationale , I ' ve reverted Neuromancer ' s edits for the second time . 	1
WTP	4326	Neuromancer also added to the lead a paragraph citing research from 1982 and 1983 , which I consider more appropriate for other sections of the article if it ' s to be included at all . 	0
WTP	4327	I ' d like to get Neuromancer ' s thoughts on this , as well as feedback from other editors - - with whom I presume but would like to verify I share a consensus - - so that my recent reversion doesn ' t seem like a single-editor fiat . 	1
WTP	4328	It ' s not articles on good things and bad things , it ' s just articles . 	0
WTP	4329	yeah , sorry my reply was to him , not to you , i ' ve tabbed correctly now Haaretz is definitely reputable as a source to use on Wikipedia . 	0
WTP	4330	— 	0
WTP	4331	Obviously , I would expect any book dealing with 1967 to discuss the USS Liberty incident . 	0
WTP	4332	However , every book dealing with 1967 also discusses its various battles which are not mentioned in this article , and I don ' t think they should be . 	1
WTP	4333	For example , with all due respect to the Battle of Ammunition Hill , likely more significant in the long term than the Liberty incident , it simply did not impact the IDF in a major way to be included here . 	0
WTP	4334	Again , don ' t forget that we have a History of the Israel Defense Forces article , which I encourage people who want to go into more detail to have a look at . 	0
WTP	4335	after reviewing the sources on the matter i believe the translation to something like " wipe zionism from the pages of history " seems to be more credible . 	1
WTP	4336	with free online translation services there is no excuse not to go check the origin when available . 	0
WTP	4337	we are discussing in english things said in parsi so we have to be extra careful and doubel check any resource claiming to bring a translation . 	1
WTP	4338	as for the topic discussed , i think eyalmc has provided sufficient resources to show that the translation " wipe israel off the map " is a misquote . 	0

WTP	4342	I would like to ask other editors whether they would find it acceptable to add a flag in the Northern Ireland history section or not , and if so which ? 	0
WTP	4343	I agree ; ending with just landmarks is bland . 	0
WTP	4344	But how are we going to word this ? 	0
WTP	4345	I find " non-heterosexual orientation , " uh , kind of weird . 	0
WTP	4346	— 	0
WTP	4347	Name something you want to add , somthing that has reliable sources and something that is significant . 	0
WTP	4348	I think the solution would be to move some of the content and sources to the article cunt ( which already discusses the issue but not in as much depth ) and the rest of the content to the Wiktionary entries on the words rabbit , coney , cunny etc . I ' m assuming you ' ll be ok with this so I ' m going to go ahead and make the necessary changes . 	0
WTP	4349	- - 	0
WTP	4350	I would be willing to consider this , but I suspect such an article may quickly find itself either merged back into this article or deleted . 	0
WTP	4351	I also feel a little uncomfortable making such a move when your expressed purpose is still that of censorship . 	0
WTP	4352	I simply cannot find in myself any impulse to limit who is allowed to read this content , because it expresses the truth , and the truth is never a bad thing to let someone read . 	0
WTP	4353	However , if I am completely honest , I have to concede that going by the strict letter of the WP : NAD policy it may well be the case that the naming section does not really belong in this article regardless of objectionable content . 	1
WTP	4354	This Telegraph article highlights the NPOV problem with this article . 	0
WTP	4355	Voice of the Faithful does not buy the argument that " clamour created in the US around this scandal is really unbearable " as Cardinal Bertone said . 	0
WTP	4356	Kermit was on the re-pilot episode of Family Guy , September 10 , 2006 . 	0
WTP	4357	From your edits this seems to bother you for another reason . 	0
WTP	4358	It is relevant because it adds a historical dimension to these critical events at the beginning of Mormonism . 	0
WTP	4359	He gets published in a local paper . 	0
WTP	4360	But there have been enough wars involving such states in modern times that it really is something for which MILHIST ought to have developed techniques . 	0
WTP	4361	I think this article suffers from some of that with glamorous pitures of equipment women soldiers , disucssion of the code of ethics in most of the article followed by the scandal . 	0
WTP	4362	It would follow Wikipedia guidelines better if say discussion of scandals associated with particular wars occurred in the place where those wars are mentioned and if the more extreme ethical abuses were included in the discussion of the ethical cide . 	0
WTP	4363	Controversy sections ( and even more so articles ) need to be handed with care as they often become content / POV forks . 	0
WTP	4364	Do you get an article which mainly consists of blurb about how wonderful and saintly a particular person or institution is written by their fans or employees and then it has a subsection about how it has been claimed on an obscure website that they eat babies . 	0
WTP	4365	It is of the nature of occupying armies that they abuse the occupied . 	0
WTP	4366	Obviously it would be somewhat peculiar to have a controversies section in Roman Army saying that it sometimes sacked cities , raping , killing or enslaving large chunks of the population . 	0
WTP	4367	also we should be aware of WP : Recentism and spend too much time on complaints about what happenned in Gaza just because it is fresh in our minds . 	0
WTP	4368	On Wikifan ' s point about there not being similr coveerage elsewhere it might be worth an approach to the WP : MILHIST project and suggest they produce guidelines on how to deal with this . 	1
WTP	4369	Controversies go in , as per WP : LEAD . 	0
WTP	4370	That ' s utterly non-negotiable . 	1
WTP	4371	The fact that it is controversial totally , always and everywhere trumps concerns about recentism . 	0

WTP	4376	As I ' m new to editing this page , you surmised correctly that I was unaware of any previous editing decisions such as having to abide by your consensus-approved outline . 	1
WTP	4377	So I appreciate the synopsis here and I ' ve already performed an undo back to your approved version that had removed all my content . 	0
WTP	4378	However , your arguments seem entirely based on this being " criticism " and the " scale " of the operation not fitting this article ' s scope . 	0
WTP	4379	I still would contend that what I ' ve added , however " disproportionate " it might seem , is not what you describe and object to as " criticism " ; this is an incident of combat soldiers coming forward ( tardily ) to report on possible ( or evident ) breaches of the IDF # Code of Conduct against militants and Palestinian civilians during an operation fought in a densely populated area , that may be considered ( and ultimately judged ? ) as along the lines of atrocities or war crimes . 	1
WTP	4380	If you and the other editors overrule this content ' s inclusion here , on what page — dealing with combat ethics in the IDF — would it belong ? 	0
WTP	4381	I see there ' s no main article on Israel Defense Forces # Code of Conduct . - - 	0
WTP	4382	I also have appreciated the efforts of numerous editors who have been watching the page and reverting vandalism , these have been a great help . 	0
WTP	4383	I appreciate the bots and I did notice they were working - great invention . 	0
WTP	4384	I hope consideration of future security will be considered if the vandalism increases , especially when we are at FAC . 	0
WTP	4385	I just thought that an article like this would qualify for the kind of protection given other high profile articles , especially when we are on track towards FAC . 	0
WTP	4386	I think there clearly is . 	0

WTP	4390	Please assume good faith , and btw O Fenian ' s ' raison d ' etre ' might more productively be continued at the Existentialism Talk Page . 	0
WTP	4391	Just like this talk page is about improving the article , not about arguing about whether the virus exists , has been isolated , causes AIDS or has been imaged by EM . 	0
WTP	4392	Yes . 	0
WTP	4393	This article is about a virus , HIV , not about opinions . 	0
WTP	4394	Just a thought . 	0
WTP	4395	Or something to that effect . 	0
WTP	4396	I would suggest changing " HIV-specific treatment delays this process " to " HIV-specific treatments have been shown to delay this progression in most , though as with any form of chemotherapy , there are inherent risks . " 	0
WTP	4397	I like what you ' ve done . . . 	0
WTP	4398	Throwing it in there for you to roll it around your tongue for a few . 	0
WTP	4399	Well , here are my two cents about what to cut ( based on what seems out of place for a lead , not based on any numeric target for length ) : 1 ) sentence starting " Previous names " ( none of these are in wide use today ) , 2 ) sentence starting " HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4 + T cells " ( too much detail for the lead ) , 3 ) somehow merge the paragraph starting " Eventually most HIV-infected individuals develop AIDS . " with the mentions elsewhere about opportunistic infections , antiretrovirals , etc ( I ' m not as sure about how to do this one ) . 	0
WTP	4400	While consensus can block sources due to a lack of quality , it cannot block simply because they claim consensus . 	0
WTP	4401	Furthermore , according to that same article , " Likewise , exceptional claims in Wikipedia require high-quality reliable sources , and , with clear editorial consensus , unreliable sources for exceptional claims may be rejected due to a lack of quality . " 	0
WTP	4402	- - 	0
WTP	4403	Logically , Wikipedia consensus should not be all that ' s needed to make a fringe theory notable , just as it should not be all that ' s needed to reject notable and well-sourced criticisms . 	0
WTP	4404	As for the epidemiology , it does seem like a lot of numbers , but we should hit high points like the huge impact on Africa ( I ' ve trimmed a bit of the language but it could probably be shorter still ) . 	0
WTP	4405	Until and unless one of the abovementioned things , or some other major detail , arises that fundamentally moves the story or resolves some loose end , I really don ' t see the problem with the size of the piece given what it covers . 	0
WTP	4406	Quite probably ; if it does , then that would be what would be relevant to mention here , if Obama used this moment of crisis to set a new or accelerated course . 	0
WTP	4407	If he doesn ' t , then that could be what would be relevant to mention , that despite this major incident we soldiered on with the drilling because ( the public / Southern governors / the oil industry complained that the loss of oil industry jobs was worse for the economy and the country than the possibility of future such accidents ? ) and as a result we were ( just fine / experienced a few more but as with terrorism under George W . Bush , that became the new normal / were utterly devastated by a series of catastrophes that ended life as we know it ) . 	0
WTP	4408	That ' s the problem with news , it ' s just news until it ' s history . 	0
WTP	4409	We could fight any mention of the spill , or we could acknowledge that unlike other distractions this is a real thing with likely real repercussions in the real world , and err on the side of making this section , you know , bigger than the automaker rescue and almost as big as health care ( both of which are also still unfolding and yet to be added to or updated ) . 	0
WTP	4410	At such time as there is a clear culprit for the cause , we could then focus on that and drop one or even two of the other company names in this bio version of the story , but until such time , that would be irresponsible . 	0
WTP	4411	At such time as the commission announces measures and Obama enacts them , we can shift the focus of those mentions to that enactment . 	0
WTP	4412	At such time as there is a real and understood shift in energy or environmental policy , we might drop a couple other issues to note that . 	0
WTP	4413	If someone wants to remove the criticism that Obama and the federal government should do more , we can whittle down some of what he ' s done , but if we did that , people would arrive re-adding that aspect . 	0
WTP	4414	I ' ll say it again , if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama ' s biography , I will not object at all . 	0
WTP	4415	I give up on anti-semitic link , not big deal . 	0
WTP	4416	My thoughts are that you make very weird silly argument . 	0
WTP	4417	Wiped off map link links to exact section , not just main article so it is helpful . 	0
WTP	4418	People know what that means . 	0
WTP	4419	No interpret here , just know how to read English . 	0
WTP	4420	And the very weird part of your argument is that I do some interpretation by linking words " Zionist regime " to article " Zionist regime " . 	0
WTP	4421	But that " just enough " of course has to be accurate . 	0
WTP	4422	We should explain just enough so that lay people can understand how it does or does not apply to evolution . 	0
WTP	4423	If the answer to both questions is " yes , " then I think we shoulod keep in the misconception , and explain it . 	1
WTP	4424	For me the questions are , ( 1 ) are these widely held misconceptions and ( 2 ) will explaining them help people understand the scientific theory of evolution and why it is so powerful and widely accepted among scientists ? 	0
WTP	4425	I think the question of whether the misunderstandings are common among creationists is in and of itself irrelevant . 	1
WTP	4426	Surely we all agree that it should be both accurate and accessible . 	0
WTP	4427	We do not need to provide en extensive , detailed account of the second law , that belongs in the linked article . 	1
WTP	4428	Let ' s distinguish between accuracy and detail . 	0
WTP	4429	In this case what is important is how the 2nd law does or does not relate to evolution , and I think this is indeed an important point . 	0
WTP	4430	The result will be an article that will educate a much wider circle of readers , and more effectively . 	0

WTP	4432	False dichotomy . 	0
WTP	4433	It ' s inappropriate and undue weight to mention BP several times and the other companies not at all when it was Transocean who owned , staffed and operated , and was responsible for , the drilling of the well and the drilling rig that exploded ( and lost 11 crew ) and it was Halliburton contractors who had done the vital job of cementing , particularly given that faulty cementing by Halliburton was alleged to be a factor in two other major blowouts . 	1
WTP	4434	Both of those companies figured about as prominently as BP in several Congressional hearings , and it is conceivable that one or both will ultimately be found partly if not fully responsible for the blowout . 	0
WTP	4435	It ' s undue weight and out of context if we were to mention people expressed frustration at the president without noting that there was even more frustration being expressed toward BP et al . On the other hand , it ' s similarly undue weight and out of context to note frustration and perception and not to give an adequate picture of what was really going on , either before or after , as reliably sourced , and further , to give it in a timeline as it actually happened and not as the storyline in the media has played out . 	1
WTP	4436	It would be absurd to note this happened without noting BP ' s failure to stop this early , as their plan suggested they could and would ; yet at the same time , it would be inappropriate to note their failures without noting that they eventually had success in capturing a huge amount of oil , considering they were capturing absolutely none of it for over a month . 	0
WTP	4437	It ' s essentially slander to keep naming BP as though they ' re the only company involved , while ignoring the other companies at the heart of this . 	0
WTP	4438	I have left out Anadarko , despite the fact they own 25% of the well and 25% of the oil , and the Japanese company who owns 10% , despite the fact that more than 1 / 3 of the oil involved in this is not owned by BP , and I have left out Cameron International who manufactured the blowout protector , , as it was past the warrantee period and it has come to light that Transocean modified the BOP counter which voids Cameron ' s responsibility . 	1
WTP	4439	And of course , once you ' re going to note more than one event , you need to establish a timeline Frankly , as I said when I first edited this section , I don ' t think any of this is really relevant to this bio yet . 	1
WTP	4440	Will it ultimately lead to a major shift in energy policy , or a major environmental and engineering response ? 	0
WTP	4441	In a nutshell , I ' d propose this : We can include any topic that has been called PS by a reliable source ( whether or not said source is " right " or reflects a majority scientific view ) . 	1
WTP	4442	As long as a sourced view is significant enough to be mentioned in a topic ' s article , it should suffice here . 	0
WTP	4443	( Tiny minority views such as " Darwinism is a pseudoscience " would be mentioned neither here nor in Darwinism . ) 	0

WTP	4453	Not crap , truth . 	0
WTP	4454	Actually , by that same logic Uriah Heep ' s debut would be the first progressive metal album . 	0
WTP	4455	Frankly , I think actually classifying the album itself ( Sabbath Bloody Sabbath ) as " progressive metal " is rather drastic , despite the current state of Wiki ' s article on it . 	0
WTP	4456	While we ' re housecleaning polls , can somebody explain why the Siena College poll , currently at the end of the section , belongs here in its current form ? 	0
WTP	4457	The only cited reference is the poll release from Siena itself , so noteworthiness can be legitimately questioned . 	0

WTP	4461	This does not exonerate the Catholic Church but I think it indicates more of a cultural problem that can not be discounted . 	1
WTP	4462	The US Dept of Education report also found that in order to avoid bad press , the principals of the schools where the abuse happened would often not report the abuse or prosecute the teacher but allowed them to be transferred to new schools . 	0
WTP	4463	Such figures led her to contend " the physical sexual abuse of students in schools is likely more than 100 times the abuse by priests . " 	0
WTP	4464	That compares with about five decades of cases of abusive priests . 	0
WTP	4465	Extrapolating data from the latter , she estimated roughly 290 , 000 students experienced some sort of physical sexual abuse by a school employee from a single decade — 1991-2000 . 	0
WTP	4466	To support her contention , Shakeshaft compared the priest abuse data with data collected in a national survey for the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation in 2000 . 	0
WTP	4467	" So we think the Catholic Church has a problem ? " she told industry newspaper Education Week in a March 10 interview . 	0
WTP	4468	Charol Shakeshaft , the Hofstra University scholar who prepared the report , said the number of abuse cases — which range from unwanted sexual comments to rape — could be much higher . 	0
WTP	4469	According to a draft report commissioned by the U . S . Department of Education , in compliance with the 2002 " No Child Left Behind " act signed into law by President Bush , between 6 percent and 10 percent of public school children across the country have been sexually abused or harassed by school employees and teachers . 	0
WTP	4470	" Now , on the heels of the Catholic abuse scandal comes another of historic proportions — one that has the potential to be much greater and far-reaching . 	0

WTP	4491	Wikipedia ' s page on Criticism simply defines it as " the judgement ( using analysis and evaluation ) of the merits and faults of the actions or work of another individual . " 	0
WTP	4492	Criticism by many reliable definitions would simply be negative statements . 	1
WTP	4493	I have a hard time believing you ' re trying to place as a definition of criticism that it has to have basis in fact . 	0
WTP	4494	Logically then , I ' m not sure where you ' re coming up with this definition of the word . 	0
WTP	4495	According to Princeton ' s definition , for example , a critic can be defined simply as " someone who frequently finds fault or makes harsh and unfair judgments " . 	0
WTP	4496	Regardless of whether it is fact-based ( and I have my doubts ) , supported by ' legitimate editors ' ( I notice you are going to try and disqualify some of the many editors who have in the past brought this up ) , and regardless of whether it is a fringe theory , it can still be discussed if notable and reliably sourced . 	1

WTP	4511	Perhaps someone can correct me , as I ' m far from an expert on Islam ; but it doesn ' t seem consistent to me to regard Roman Catholicism , Orthodoxy and Protestantism as separate " faiths " , while regarding all branches of Islam as the same faith . 	0
WTP	4512	( It may , however , be the case that even Sunni Muslims , who make up about 85% of Muslims , outnumber Catholics ; but that doesn ' t seem to be the story as presented ) . 	0
WTP	4513	The two aren ' t really comparable , though , are they ? 	1
WTP	4514	Christianity , with around two billion members , is the largest faith . 	0
WTP	4515	The Roman Catholic Church , with around a billion members , is the largest single religious body . 	0
WTP	4516	Islam is a faith containing several religious bodies ; it may be larger than the Roman Catholic Church , but it isn ' t larger than Christianity and isn ' t a single body ( there is the well-known divide into Sunni and Shi ' a for a start ) , so I don ' t actually think that this is an especially significant fact . 	0

WTP	4557	A century and a few decades later , the article about Cole , when combined with the other article supporting Smith ' s claim to have seen heavenly visions , his Anti-Mormon voice provides credibility to the idea that Smith told people about his vision before the Church was established in 1830 . 	0
