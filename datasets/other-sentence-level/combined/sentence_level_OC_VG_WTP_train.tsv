OC	58	I don ' t feel like it ' s so astute to point out that the Oscars are kind of pompous and out of touch . 	1
OC	59	Plus criticisms like that , coming from someone who lost , just come off as petty . 	0
OC	60	Add the excessive bitterness , and I don ' t think she really accomplished more than making herself look like an ass . 	0

OC	72	/ end rant from motorcyclist with a brain . . . . and alive after 13 years of riding in sydney traffic : P Edited at 2008-03-05 02 : 27 am UTC 	0
OC	73	Only idiots ride in between lanes . 	0
OC	74	Gay , bi , or whatever , I think that ' s the lesson I learned , and the film is about what happens if you * don ' t * learn and apply that lesson . 	0
OC	75	The publicity for the film gets the film wrong , but I think the film gets this point sort of " right . " 	0
OC	76	I hear you more clearly . 	0
OC	77	I suppose I could agree with you and still go in a slightly different direction : I think stunted passion can drive people to lead lives in which they appear to be passionless . 	1
OC	78	It ' s not an easy mindset to recall after nearly a decade being out of the closet , but I would say that I spent a good deal of my 20s , when I felt both uncomfortable with my own sexuality and isolated about being who I was , using my drive and my power as an intellectual , emotional , and spiritual being to either route my passion anywhere BUT sex , or to holding myself in . 	0
OC	79	In a sense , what the movie gets " right " for me happens most clearly with Ennis ' s character : the force of nature of his passion is one he devotes to containing himself , rather than trying to break free . 	0
OC	80	And he does fail to contain himself in many ways . . . but what ' s tragic is that had he failed a little more , he might have been able to succeed at something a lot more fulfilling . 	0
OC	81	Does that make any sense ? 	0
OC	82	Maybe one way I could come at it is nothing more than this : I had a couple of clunky , difficult relationships with women before I came out as a queer man , and I ' ve had a couple of decent relationships with women since coming out , fucking around with a lot of men , and giving my whole heart and soul to a couple of men over the years . 	0
OC	83	Which is to say : although my desires for women are a fairly small part of my overall makeup , I could only express them decently once I took the brakes off my WHOLE self . 	0

OC	96	There is also a group rallying against our practices with sheep ! ! ! 	0
OC	97	( Sheep have a flap of ' foreskin ' type thing that hangs off their butts and gets painfully infected by parasites and leads to their death - so sheep herders in the maritimes have been and other peoples have been cutting that skin off for THOUSANDS OF YEARS - but now they ' re writting letters to us demanding we ban it . 	0
OC	98	They ' ve got pictures circulating of people from Abu Ghraib , covered in what appears to be shit and blood , being beat , hung upside down , raped and worse - though I shudder to think of what could be worse than what I ' ve seen so far . 	0

OC	141	* smacks blonde wig on Axel * I think as far as DiZ is concerned , he is very smart but also in certain areas very dumb - - witness the fact that he didn ' t notice his apprentices were going to turn on him , when some of them ( cough Vexen cough ) aren ' t exactly subtle by nature . 	1

OC	170	Barring a clear choice based on teachers , however , you might want to save Buddhism for a later part of your undergraduate career . 	0
OC	171	Barring that , I would first go with your instincts based on your knowledge ( direct or by reputation ) of the philosophy professors teaching those classes if you want to choose between the two . 	0

OC	203	The folks they officially grant permission to perform exorcism are supposed to be levelheaded enough to avoid this kind of bad press , while still combating the possessions the Church has to believe occur now and then . 	0
OC	204	It seems counterintuitive , but the Church knows just as well as anyone how ridiculous they would look treating every rebellious teen as possessed , or what have you . 	0
OC	205	The chief of the branch should be even more responsible than the run-of-the-mill exorcist , not less . 	0
OC	206	Yes . 	1
OC	207	Well , frankly ? 	0
OC	208	The job of exorcist is supposed to be rather like folks involved in canonization - to be skeptical , seek solid evidence , then act - not to see devils everywhere and try to solve every problem with exorcism . 	0
OC	209	I don ' t believe in their party line , but they do , and this is inconsistent with what the job is supposed to entail , if I remember correctly from Catholic Boot Camp . 	0

OC	217	I cant even imagine what the medical examiner had to face when they showed up . and I also remember that at first I assumed the husband who got killed was the guy she was fighting over . 	0
OC	218	she got the idea from being a chemical expert in the army , but apparently the training and expertise didnt delve far enough into body disposal . 	0
OC	219	I remember reading that the acid didnt work out as well as she would have hoped . 	0
OC	220	and I havent seen anything on the internet posted since the army took over her prosecution and made her disappear . 	0
OC	221	ya , I cant believe she did it in the first place , and then that she wandered around with the baby and then confessed ! 	0
OC	222	so let that be a lesson . . . if youre gonna cheat on your husband , do it with a guy who doesnt also have an insane homicidal stalker . 	0

OC	1578	Obviously everyone except for Wilf is protected by not having fully human DNA and thus being immune to the overwrite . 	0
OC	1579	So are we supposed to assume that the only non-Master people left on the planet are Wilf , the Doctor , Donna , and maybe the green people ? 	0
OC	1580	The Naismith family also needs some background info , as well as the green people . 	0
OC	1581	Still , how does a former prime minister gather a crazed group of disciples ? 	0
OC	1582	Presumably , because at the end of series three they only rewound to right before the arrival of the American convoy , there ' d still be stuff left about Saxon ' s existence . 	0

OC	1594	What makes it even harder is the fact that she is admittedly open to both sexes , which makes things seem even more possible , but I don ' t know how to reconcile my feelings for her . 	0
OC	1595	I have been struggling with this for a really long while and she has expressed interest in meeting me as well . 	0
OC	1596	I really , really want to meet her , but I am afraid because I don ' t know what to expect , if anything . 	0
OC	1597	Thank you for the opportunity to get this off of my chest . 	0
OC	1598	I can ' t seem to get over this insane crush that I have on a girl that I met in the Colbert community . 	0
OC	1599	She and I have a lot in common and I always eagerly await her comments , replies , etc and find myself wanting to do things for her and talk to her , but I already have someone in my life and it is frankly really confusing . 	0
OC	1600	Part of me is telling myself to be careful because I already have someone , but another part of me really wishes that I could go for her . 	0
OC	1601	I honestly have little attraction to men as a rule in the physical sense , so personality , talents , mannerisms , and interests become more of the basis for my feelings for someone . 	0

OC	1646	I use Photobucket because it ' s easy and the service it provides is enough for what I do ( read : not a lot ) . 	0
OC	1647	But I wouldn ' t recommend it if you intend on linking a lot of people to it because it has a tendency to go " OMG TOO MANY PAGE VIEWS EXCEEDED BANDWIDTH WE ARE GONNA MAKE DIS IMAGE UNAVAILABABLE UNTIL NEXT MONTH ! " 	0
OC	1648	I -could - be wrong about it , but I ' m pretty sure I ' m not . 	0
OC	1649	I was going to suggest Facebook , but FB has a 60 image limit per album and uploads can be a bit of a bitch . 	1
OC	1650	It crashes a lot in the middle of big uploads , which is very frustrating . 	0

OC	1675	i seem to have successfully extracted myself from academia , for the time being - - somehow managed to graduate last sunday - - and have landed in the most mahvelous summer job at the tar pits as the assistant excavator and it ' s like summer camp , only better , because i get PAID to learn anatomy and hang out with the loveliest people and i HURT everywhere my last day at the vile lawfirm was tuesday first day at the museum on wednesday and five days straight excavating since then and i hurt EVerywhere my back , my right arm , my left palm , my abdominal muscles , my feet - - which is bizarre because i spend most of my day lying on my stomach , leaning over a 3 x 3 foot grid of asphalt picking at dead animals and i am just so thrilled to be in so much pain it ' s great and i don ' t have a paper to write ! 	1

OC	1702	It ' s hard to resist arguing with them , but they ' re all so fucking stupid that it doesn ' t even get you anywhere . 	0
OC	1703	I know , it ' s irritating . 	0
OC	1704	I have issues with " film critics " who insert their own visions of what they believe is " proper sociology " --whether it ' s a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances . 	0
OC	1705	Some people have issues with the story . . . others don ' t want to deal with the hype about it . . . . others see something to it . . . and all points of view are fine . 	0
OC	1706	As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life ' s difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not . 	0
OC	1707	I ' ve had my own experience in losing people and property by murder , death , robbery , and accident to know that it ' s awful to live through and easier to deal with with the compassion of others . 	0
OC	1708	I don ' t have to live through a hurricane myself in order to do SOMETHING to help people affected by one . . . 	0
OC	1709	Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my " thing " for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship . . . she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad . . . 	0
OC	1710	If you can ' t put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my " logic " , then the storyline will hold nothing for you . . . and that would be unfortunate . 	0
OC	1711	No , you don ' t need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to " legitimately " comment on it . . . for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation . 	1
OC	1712	And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of " holding court " . 	0
OC	1713	I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-centered hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors . 	0
OC	1714	Aha ! 	0
OC	1715	Yes , it was completely anonymous . 	0

OC	1734	Sometimes the " I am putting all the food I own into this one meal before it goes bad while I am at home for a week " meal ends up being pretty damn good , but it was not the International Passport with Swedish pancakes and lingonberries . 	0
OC	1735	So I made myself a spinach salad with sliced pears , crumbled bacon , shredded Jarlsberg cheese , and raspberry vinaigrette . 	0
OC	1736	I had every intention of going to the Harvard Square IHOP on Saturday afternoon before flying back home , but I realized that I had a ton of food in my fridge that needed to be cooked and eaten ( including a pound of salmon that had gone bad anyway - FAIL ) . 	0
OC	1737	Does that not mean anything to you ? 	0

OC	1747	And honestly , if I wanted to have a screenshot of a site to make it look nice , I ' d probably at least consider using Safari ; the stuff is more typographically " correct " using that rendering , which in the context of an image of a site may well look better . 	0
OC	1748	A lot of people seem to prefer it , though . 	0

OC	2126	Everyone takes turns opening a gift , and if someone gets something you want , you can steal it from them . 	0
OC	2127	Everyone buys a unisex gift and wraps it with no name tag . 	0
OC	2128	It ' s the most fun if you have at least 10 people because people constantly steal from each other and in my family it can get ruthless XD 	0
OC	2129	It ' s better / easier for me if I use packaged egg whites , because then I have a hope of using the " leftovers " before they go bad . 	1
OC	2130	As to why I don ' t have shell eggs , it ' s twofold : I do better when I avoid egg yolks , and my use of eggs in general is mostly for baking . 	0
OC	2131	So as long as I keep that in mind and reduce the oil by at least 1 / 3 , it should be okay . 	0
OC	2132	Really , the only thing likely to give me fits is the egg / oil mix , because I ' ve found that my egg white breads don ' t " hold " the oil the same way when made with whole eggs . 	1
OC	2133	I don ' t have any milk-milk , so I ' ll need to reconstitute some from powder , then measure it , because I ' m not sure exactly how much powder and water are needed for three tablespoons ( 2tsp of powder and 8tsp of water ? ) and with quantities in this range , there ' s less tolerance for error , but that ' s not bad . 	1
OC	2134	I have the flour and the sugar , so that ' s set . 	0
OC	2135	It was a thinking-out-loud sort of thing . 	0
OC	2136	And it ' s not the last word . 	0
OC	2137	According to the head of a group advocating for G / L federal employees , Obama * can ' t * simply unilaterally change pension and healthcare rights without Congressional action . 	0
OC	2138	But something * did * happen . 	0
OC	2139	It ' s not all that we would have wanted , but it ' s more than ever happened under Bush . 	0
OC	2140	The words of my defensive driving instructor ! ! 	0
OC	2141	Believe me , that ' s exactly what was going through my head ! 	0
OC	2142	I understand your frustration and disappointment , but don ' t treat something valuable as nothing because it ' s not everything all at once . 	0
OC	2143	I was envious of them , but I would never be that stupid go between the traffic . 	0
OC	2144	That ' ll learn you ! 	0
OC	2145	The only reason our schools are " competitive " is because the administration choose to do things like this : force us to choose between our own school and everyone else . 	0
OC	2146	and , of course , we are obligated to choose our own school . 	0
OC	2147	I may crash some Paxon after " party , " because I miss you guys , but Stanton prom is free , and your prom is expensive . 	1

OC	2150	I remember it was MIDNIGHT I actually went to sleep whereas when you came I was at the computer . 	0
OC	2151	It seems to me that the overwhelming mass of their garments is only accentuated with the ridiculous level of adornment ; it â s as if someone reached back into the early 90 â s , got their hands on a Bedazzler and went plastic rhinestone crazy . 	0

OC	2154	gosh , that murakami exhibit at the brooklyn museum was awesome , wasn ' t it ? 	0
OC	2155	But if we do , there ' s an obligation to be careful where we point the thing . 	1
OC	2156	It ' s generally a bad idea to make one ' s " feminist " argument at the expense of actual women ' s experiences . 	0
OC	2157	if something causes wisps of steam to begin issuing from my ears , I will almost certainly learn something significant from it . 	0
OC	2158	There are folks whose writing I read primarily for that purpose - though a fair chunk of the time , it ' s my own argument that gets vivisected . 	0
OC	2159	That kind of situation is what the phrase " stop being on my side , you ' re making my side look stupid " was invented for . 	0

OC	2168	Ok have a good evening : ) may be see you later : ) 	0
OC	2169	It ' s not just an academic exercise in utopian philosophy ; real people , with diverse individual needs , will be living the changes we make . 	0
OC	2170	Making feminist arguments at the expense of actual women ' s experiences is , IMO , one of the most significant fracture points within feminism , The reverse is also true : the political is personal . 	0
OC	2171	Mind you , Canada isn ' t perfect , by any means ; another part of why it was possible for me is because my family was supportive - I ' d have been in a much more precarious position if they weren ' t . 	0
OC	2172	Kid won , of course . ) 	0
OC	2173	( My son ' s father didn ' t even get an opt-in ; he was . . . not very stable - but again , Canadian conditions meant I only had to consider that problem in terms of the personal , weighing fairness to him against what it could mean for my baby if he took it into his head to try for custody . 	0
OC	2174	I ' m pretty sure we ' re at least close to the same page - it ' s partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter ' s father opt out . 	1
OC	2175	( IOW , I think he might be a Nice Guy ( tm ) . ) 	0
OC	2176	What I suspect here is that he has a vested interest in not changing the institutional injustices , because in a just world , women wouldn ' t need men . 	0
OC	2177	I suspect the latter , because of him bringing up " pregnancy is so dangerous " as an argument supporting mandatory support - the only connection I can see between them is that the financial support would mean better health care ( assuming the father , or his parents , have or are able to earn enough to make a difference ) and an improved , but not risk-free , outcome ; otherwise , obligating the father ' s involvement has no effect on those dangers ( or may have a negative effect ) . 	0
OC	2178	I ' m not so sure the KiSA is on your side ; he didn ' t seem to have the slightest interest in the injustices I was trying to talk about - at best , he ' s convinced they ' re immutable ; at worst , he ' s got a hidden agenda . 	1

OC	2865	The McLellan family had written to Canadian senators to say they cancelled a vacation in Canada because of the hunt , which they called " horrible " and " inhumane , " Montreal ' s La Presse reports . 	0
OC	2866	While I don ' t at all agree with the seal hunt , I give huge props to this : Senator fires back at U .

OC	2867	She said Americans are not in a position to criticize others . 	0
OC	2868	In her response , Senator CÃ©line Hervieux-Payette said that what she finds horrible is " the daily massacre of innocent people in Iraq , the execution of prisoners â mainly blacks â in American prisons , the massive sale of handguns to Americans , the destabilization of the entire world by the American government ' s aggressive foreign policy , etc .

OC	2871	Full article . 	0
OC	2872	CNN probably unfairly concluded that blacks overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , but it doesn ' t excuse anyone for voting for prop 8 , because a lot of every race was responsible for its passage . 	0
OC	2873	( Actually , the pro-8 people really really twisted it so bad it made me want to puke . ) 	0
OC	2874	We all know religion was what caused the passage , but my main gripe was that people decided to fall on religion instead of their experience to vote . 	0
OC	2875	But let ' s assume that poll conducted by CNN was severely flawed as speculated . 	0
OC	2876	I was more upset that a majority of people who voted for the issue didn ' t see the measure as an issue of rights and equality for all , just about gay marriage . 	0
OC	2877	Again , expectations were turned upside-down , and that was what upset me the most . 	0
OC	2878	Even the Catholic church made a huge push to support 8 as well , but the Hispanics who are usually very religious only barely supported the measure . 	0
OC	2879	So many good ones to choose from ! 	0
OC	2880	Turns out it was the other way around . 	0
OC	2881	I originally thought that the Hispanic population would have overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , and that the blacks would be 50 / 50 . 	0

OC	3294	A quick summary is that Apple want the fonts to look nice , whereas Microsoft want the text to be more readable . 	0
OC	3295	After my post a bit earlier in Windows Safari , kurisu posted this fascinating article on the differences between Windows and OS X ( and now Safari for Windows ) font rendering , which has puzzled me for ages . 	0
OC	3296	I think it ' s fair to say that neither is " better " , but it ' s interesting to see the way the different approaches go . 	1
OC	3297	So far we ' ve watched Seasons 1 , 2 and 7 . 	0
OC	3298	Season 7 was amazing ! 	1
OC	3299	We are trying to catch up on Survivor before watching this current season of Heroes vs Villains to really appreciate who all these people are . 	0
OC	3300	Unfortunately , I had only seen 14-19 and Matt had only seasons 18 & 19 . 	0
OC	3301	We can get seasons 11-now on itunes . 	0
OC	3302	But what about seasons 3-6 ? 	0
OC	3303	There are so many great people with intense ( good & bad ) personalities , crazy challenges , big surprises and it ' s all pirate themed . 	0
OC	3304	And allowing men to skip out entirely on responsibility for their offspring leaves single moms in the lurch . 	0
OC	3305	I can find them online for free but the quality is TERRIBLE ! 	0
OC	3306	Anyone know where I can get seasons 3-6 that isn ' t a choppy , garbley mess with a giant logo slapped over a huge part of it ? 	0
OC	3307	The only good thing about this whole nightmare is seeing how loving and selfless people are being towards the victims of this fire . 	0
OC	3308	And that doesn ' t even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 ' s . 	0
OC	3309	It ' s one thing to not understand what you ' ve never experienced , it ' s another thing entirely to disdain what you don ' t understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over . 	0
OC	3310	You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L . A . or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story . . . and if you ' ve never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die . . . then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story . 	0
OC	3311	The story of " Brokeback Mountain " is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says " Oh , Bob--I LOVE YOU ! " and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying " THIS IS A LOVE STORY . . . YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . " 	1
OC	3312	And while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the " ivory tower " . 	1
OC	3313	I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein--he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear . 	0
OC	3314	They are happy to be urban--and urbane- - " queers " of 2005 , and they never presume to " lower themselves " to understand lives that are different from their own . . . very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population . . . as " W " has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life . 	1
OC	3315	That is the big problem with blowhards like them- - they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men . . . therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them . 	0
OC	3316	I ' m pretty numb right now and trying to stay that way so I don ' t have a meltdown . 	0
OC	3317	But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted . . . and depression , too . 	1
OC	3318	It ' s a love story alright . . . but it ' s a tragedy , too . . . passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that can ' t be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love . 	0

OC	3654	I think my spiffy new icon tells you quite a lot about what I , as a feminist , think of men ( however they identify ) who want to slay villains for me . 	0
OC	3655	As I ' ve already mentioned , I ' m down with ( authentic ) male feminists ; they are my brothers-in-arms , and I ' m very glad to have them fighting beside me , watching my back , and all those other good warrior metaphors . 	0

OC	3659	So - you can see Sir Lancelot in action at Derek ' s Doing Feminism - not Derek ; you should have no trouble identifying the guy in the tin suit in the comments , even before I take him to task . 	0
OC	3660	Since ol ' Lance has already transformed himself into Brave Sir Robin and flounced ( ' bout a six , I figure ; the execution was technically quite good , if unoriginal , until he spoiled it by coming back for one parting shot ) , there ' s little point in piling on him there ; I doubt it ' ll penetrate his + 4 Armor of Complacence ( what , surely you don ' t think he won ' t sneak back to see how we took it ? ) , and it ' ll just distract further from what could be a very productive discussion ( which you could join if you ' re so inclined ) . 	0
OC	3661	Anyway , it wouldn ' t be courteous to Derek . 	0
OC	3662	And , since I ' m going to mention over there that I ' ve snarked about it here , with link , chances are we ' ll have a meal of Silly Knigget deliver itself right to my doorstep - dinner ' s on me ! 	0

OC	4940	I was typing in my e-mail , depending on gmail ' s autosave function to save it as I went . 	0
OC	4941	I spent most of my shift at work writing a paper . 	0
OC	4942	Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck . 	0
OC	4943	Well , internet explorer just " encountered a problem and had to close " and it turns out gmail wasn ' t autosaving ( at least , not since 5pm when I had only a basic outline finished ) and my whole paper is gone . 	0
OC	4944	Assuming height-weight proportionate in both cases , which can make a difference . 	0
OC	4945	Plain . 	0
OC	4946	Looks aren ' t everything . 	1
OC	4947	In fact , they usually lead to an artificially inflated sense of worth for the attractive person , and attitudes which usually piss me off to no end . 	0
OC	4948	Plus they ' ll likely be bad at sex , having never had to put much effort into it and not the intelligence to realize how much fun it can actually be . 	0
OC	4949	The ' plain ' girl probably has plenty of things that make her beautiful , if one looks . 	0
OC	4950	And there are many measures for that . 	0
OC	4951	The intelligence would be a definite aphrodisiac , assuming she knew how to apply it to the situation . 	0
OC	4952	Then there are the girls who are pretty dang hot but seem to think they ' re plain , yet happen to be Mensa material , AND are flexible as hell and passionate to no end in bed . 	0
OC	4953	THOSE are the ones I look for . 	0
OC	4954	It isn ' t hopeless anywhere in the world . 	0
OC	4955	But it ' s a hell of a climb out of the grave they ' re making us think we ' re digging ourselves . 	0
OC	4956	Some are just more blatant and short-term about their despotic megalomania . 	0
OC	4957	You ' d probably have to travel far less distance , if you ' d have to travel at all , in order to live in a place just as corrupted as the US has become . 	0
OC	4958	Problem is , having lived through that myself , as I say , I ' m not sure it ' s a story I really needed to sit through again . 	0

OC	4988	I especially love the guy throwing his mind out the window ( he lost his mind voluntarily ) . 	0
OC	4989	Also , the moon is often connected with insanity ( which you probably knew , based on this poem ) , so it fits together perfectly . 	0
OC	4990	Well , I agree . 	0
OC	4991	Those panels look GREAT ! 	0
OC	4992	Whatareyatalking about ? ? 	0
OC	4993	But it isn ' t any more hopeless than most of the rest of the world . 	1
OC	4994	FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU i would have killed to see that . 	0
OC	4995	It isn ' t like these people and their agenda only exists within the borders of the US or that it ' s an American idea and Americans mean to take over the world starting with their own country . 	0
OC	4996	After all , it ' s a New World Order they ' re aiming for . 	0
OC	4997	I ' m one of the people who is kinda intimidated by you and your many stories but I ' m afraid to tell you that because it would come off as bitchy and maybe it still will . 	0

OC	5009	I ' ll be a guinea pig for the project . 	0
OC	5010	googling that , i discovered that it was probably loaded with a virus / spyware / malware , and so one shouldn ' t do it and just delete the movie . . 	0
OC	5011	how was the performance ? ? ? 	0
OC	5012	Tried a site and after completing the download of two movies and going to watch them via my VLC media player ( plays all / most codecs flawlessly ) , got the ominous message " To play this movie , you need to download moviexplayer from X " . . 	0
OC	5013	. . 	0
OC	5014	This particular argument has more to do with social standards . 	0
OC	5015	It is accepted that all people are " sinners " but Christians are supposed to repent their sins . 	0
OC	5016	I ' m not a Christian so I ' m not sure how " Grace " figures into this discussion . 	0
OC	5017	My understanding is that " grace " has to do with salvation . 	0
OC	5018	My argument is just that it is hypocritical to punish homosexuals for being unrepentant sinners but allow divorced people off the hook . 	0
OC	5019	Christ didn ' t say anything about homosexuals but he was quite explicit about divorce . 	0
OC	5020	The issue seems to be that giving social status in the Church to unrepentant sinners would encourage sin by setting a bad example . 	0
OC	5021	How have we , as citizens in this Land of the Free , come to spit in the face of our Founding Fathers ? 	0

OC	5025	Why should they deny any rights to homosexuals from a few verses in the Bible ? 	1
OC	5026	Bop it ! 	0

OC	5044	: ( I believed in her character , where that kind of thing would take really REALLY good fanfic to be convincing , yeah ? 	0
OC	5045	Poor kids . 	0
OC	5046	So , um , thank you for pointing it out . 	0
OC	5047	. . . how much out of the loop am I to have had no idea there was a new Robyn record out ? 	0

OC	5050	True . 	0
OC	5051	Trite ? 	0
OC	5052	Preachy ? 	0
OC	5053	Do you really think , if he wasn ' t there to do it , you wouldn ' t pick yourself up ? 	0
OC	5054	You don ' t really need someone to save you . 	0
OC	5055	But as it turns out you manage faster on your own when there ' s no one to crawl into bed with you . 	0
OC	5056	That is what I would say to myself : you think you have fallen to the point where he is essential to push you out of bed , you need somebody to do it and he is the only one that cares enough . 	0
OC	5057	They were right ; they just handled the announcement poorly . 	0
OC	5058	That there is even a need for that implies that people aren ' t happy with the government . 	0
OC	5059	The essence of the social contract is that if people aren ' t happy , the government should change--not that the government should try to gather intelligence to increase its power over them . 	0
OC	5060	Well , yeah , and the NSA too . 	0
OC	5061	Still , domestic intelligence ? 	0
OC	5062	Mocking the Catholic church at this stage in history is almost redundant . 	0

OC	5075	Holy shit that is cool . 	0
OC	5076	Is that a white dude ? 	0
OC	5077	On the upside you don ' t actually have to attend any of the lectures if you don ' t feel you need to . 	0
OC	5078	Yes there are lectures on Saturdays . 	0
OC	5079	It ' d be easy to get to cons , has a long battery life , and best of all , isn ' t expensive . 	0
OC	5080	You . . . should get a netbook . 	0
OC	5081	Also , are you going to Anthrocon later this year ? 	0
OC	5082	You could probably pay it off with the savings you get by not running the fan at those speeds all the time . 	0
OC	5083	I ' m not making it out to FC , and it ' d be cool to hang out with you for a while . 	0
OC	5084	: ) 	0

OC	5089	amazing ! 	0
OC	5090	don ' t start today though - lets wait and see if anyone else is in then we can all do it together , i think we ' ll all be more motivated to do it that way xx 	1
OC	5091	I ' m not an expert , but I ' m also going to be doing this on our floors in a couple of months . 	0
OC	5092	I think , if I had it to do over again , I would concentrate more on the edges and use non-water-soluble poly . 	0
OC	5093	They ' re currently working on our house , but should be done and looking for a new project in February or March . . . 	0
OC	5094	: ) If you want an expert , though , we have a pair of carpenters that did a floor in my old landlord ' s apartment , and it looked beautiful . 	0

OC	5105	However , you can ' t do that with everyone . 	0
OC	5106	well being honest with some people is good . 	0
OC	5107	but since you don ' t like the " best friend " idea . 	0
OC	5108	I know you don ' t like the title of best friend , but normally that is the person you can be most honest with . 	0
OC	5109	Ermm . . . 	0
OC	5110	I ' ll say that your inner circle of friends are prolly the only ones you should be as honest as you want with . 	0
OC	5111	Why ? 	0
OC	5112	Ok , that kinda means that being confrontational with everyone is a bad idea . 	1
OC	5113	I guess if you are willing to get along with fewer people , then it ' s really no big deal . 	0
OC	5114	My sympathies and love are with you both . 	0
OC	5115	ever . 	0
OC	5116	I suspect this has to do with a keyboard-interface-related mental trigger - certainly my phrasings , and I ' m pretty sure my debative skills and tactics , become sharper and more precise , when I ' m resisting the temptation to descend into ad hominem arson ( " I may be a skunk , but you ' re a piece of junk . 	0
OC	5117	mitch clementine ! 	0
OC	5118	i bet NO ONE has ever said that before . 	0
OC	5119	Reading the article I ( as a Catholic ) have two theories : 1 ) Dudeman has actually gotten some proof somewhere that the Vatican has been beset by the Devil . 	0
OC	5120	2 ) Dudeman , at age 85 , has a gotten a touch of senile dementia that ' s affected him from investigating over 70 , 000 cases of demonic possession over his career . 	0
OC	5121	That senile dementia is now causing him to see shadows where there are none . 	0
OC	5122	I ' m discovering something very interesting about feminist discourse : if something causes wisps of steam to begin issuing from my ears , I will almost certainly learn something significant from it . 	1

OC	5159	This year â s prom dress assortment is a fabric realization of what can only be described as Betty Crocker â s nightmare . 	1
OC	5160	Cakes , why do they all look like cakes ? 	0
OC	5161	It â s a wonder these posh teens can even fit through door frames with such voluminous skirts . 	0
OC	5162	True to the gluttonous American , these crude confections have enough tulle to feed a third world fishing village , enough sequins to outfit an entire army of transvestites , and enough fabric to clothe all seven the Von Trap children with still a generous portion left over for their fat great aunt . 	0

OC	5233	Sometimes the arguments are so devoid of intelligence , or I ' ve heard them so many times before , that there ' s no reward in refuting them , but if the other side is willing to engage , then having to explain myself and not getting any free passes means that the argument gets a good workout . 	0
OC	5234	Is this HHGGTG ? 	0
OC	5235	But right now we don ' t have that . 	0
OC	5236	Instead , we have conservative think tanks complaining that what little aid we do give costs too much . 	0
OC	5237	What " choice for men " comes down to for me is who bears the cost instead . 	1
OC	5238	I ' m a lot more comfortable with the idea of a father being able to legally opt out if there ' s a sufficient support system in place so that the child ' s mother can raise the child without assistance from the father - even if she chooses not to . 	0
OC	5239	But it ' s not particularly relevant here unless one takes the attitude that child support is supposed to be either compensation for , or an equivalent " punishment " to , pregnancy , and I don ' t see how one can reconcile that attitude with feminism . 	0
OC	5240	And as for calling folks on things , it depends on the situation . 	0
OC	5241	I think the bringing up of " pregnancy is so dangerous " may simply have been a context failure . 	1
OC	5242	I typically see that argument used in the context of pro-choice or childfree advocacy , and he may have just internalized that as " the feminist position . " 	0
OC	5243	So marked . 	0

OC	5823	It ' s like infecting someone with a disease on purpose and saying they " caught " it . 	0
OC	5824	And if you don ' t agree it ' s only because the meme that makes you think otherwise is a strong one . 	0
OC	5825	But , anyway , yeah . 	0
OC	5826	Well , I actually don ' t much care for the term in general , as it means engaging with a corner of philosophy of the mind that I find a little silly . 	1

OC	6052	It ' s her journal , I ' m pretty sure she can post whatever the fuck she wants on it . 	1
OC	6053	Yep , checked there right after checking the main survivor site on cbs . 	0
OC	6054	It looks like Hulu ' s policy seems to be to only offer what is currently being offered by who has that copyright . 	0
OC	6055	I ' ve noticed that with other shows too . 	0
OC	6056	When you could get all 4 recent seasons of survivor on the main site there were all on hulu . 	0
OC	6057	now both hulu and the main site only have clips and bits of the last 2 seasons . 	0

OC	6060	Criiiiptic . 	0
OC	6061	Expect it sometime when I ' m less exhausted and tipsy . 	0
OC	6062	I understand you ' re starting out with a general " someone , " not revealing the sex or identity until a line or two later . 	0
OC	6063	It might ( I say might because this is completely subjective ) be stronger if you stated , " He lost his mind / in the middle of the road . " 	0
OC	6064	Post it ! 	0
OC	6065	Do it ! 	0
OC	6066	Rock it ! 	0

OC	6069	I ' m sorry to hear that keeping up with technological progression is being especially irritating . 	0
OC	6070	I owe you an email , Sir ! 	0
OC	6071	Scary enough to compel you to clean the bathroom ! 	0
OC	6072	: : waves wildly : : Glad you ' re not , like , holed up in a cave somewhere , eating beetles . 	0

OC	6087	I also don ' t have any jobs to give to those 15000 Inuit , native , and traditional hunters who earn a living from this enterprise . . . 	0
OC	6088	I ' m sorry to go off on you - I ' m just so angry at Americans for writing , and for Paul McCartney ' s photo op in PEI . 	0
OC	6089	In this case , polar bears , which used to be numerous in Newfoundland and Labrador , and NWT kept the seals down , but since they ' re on the extinction list . . . they haven ' t been doing alot lately . 	0
OC	6090	The number of seals has actually doubled since the 70s . . . and do you know how much they eat ? 	0
OC	6091	They would populate themselves into famine if left unchecked . 	0
OC	6092	I used to be against it , until I had to study the fisheries and now I get that though many animals are cute , and these are the ones I don ' t like seeing killed ( seals , deers , rabbits , kangaroos ) that sometimes it is necessary . 	1
OC	6093	I don ' t want to get argumentative on LJ , but why don ' t you agree with the seal hunt ? 	0
OC	6094	Do you agree with hunting deer ? 	0
OC	6095	Culling cat and dog populations by neutering ? 	0
OC	6096	The unfortunate truth is that we ' ve killed off many of the predators that kept seal populations in check ( like we did with deer and moose , etc ) . 	0
OC	6097	and i love how that picture turned out ! 	0
OC	6098	congrats . . 	0
OC	6099	all good news ! ! 	0

OC	6104	We will see . . . . 	0
OC	6105	Dude , you are not just barking up the wrong tree , your mellow-yet-professional , probably New Age , yoga-teaching ass is barking up about three different wrong trees simultaneously . 	0
OC	6106	I just hope it reaches you before the New Year . 	0
OC	6107	that was really cute 	0
OC	6108	When he asked for the pamphlets back to pass around to the next class , I stood up and tore my copy up in front of him . 	0

OC	6115	Oh , and she always complains to her husband about how she doesn ' t even know who she is anymore and he spends too much time at the office and is he cheating on her with his secretary . 	0
OC	6116	She ' s just one of those moms who wears the mom jeans while trucking her kids to soccer and ballet . 	0
OC	6117	Neither . 	1
OC	6118	Sent from Vicenze in NW Italy , where it ' s raining a ton but the gelato is good . 	0
OC	6119	I ' m not sure I ' d sign on to the Marxist part of your definition of radical feminist . 	1
OC	6120	That only describes a fraction of the overall group . 	0
OC	6121	In Germany , single motherhood is less common than in the U . S . - people are less delusional about sex and birth control . 	0
OC	6122	But up until recently , anyway , going on welfare as a single mother was not terribly stigmatized . 	0
OC	6123	The German social safety net has been progressively undermined over the past few years , so I have to think that this option is getting harder - they have a lot more emphasis on working to earn one ' s benefits , which is obviously a problem if you have little ones . 	0
OC	6124	( Germany ' s public daycare system is also being slowly de-funded . ) 	0
OC	6125	Sunflower , you were in Canada when you had your babies , yes ? 	0
OC	6126	Because as jfpbookworm points out , the supports are awfully thin here in the U . S . The only reason men get stuck with child support is that society as a whole isn ' t willing to support children of single parents . 	1
OC	6127	At least in Canada , you ' re covered for health care . 	0
OC	6128	( Here , too , in theory , but there are holes in the CHIPS program . ) 	0
OC	6129	First my jaw fell open , and then I laughed so hard I woke the bird AND the husband ! 	0

OC	6132	YESSSS ! ! 	0
OC	6133	lol . 	0
OC	6134	i don ' t see you either ! 	0
OC	6135	I think it is seriously messed up that you think about it . 	0
OC	6136	Also , Jack is going to be messed up after Children Of Earth . 	0
OC	6137	Even though the next episode promises to be even more ridiculous , I ' m still excited . 	0
OC	6138	It ' ll be interesting to see how Donna ' s memories are preserved . 	0
OC	6139	DOOOO IIITTT 	0
OC	6140	I might just do it . . . 	1
OC	6141	This is a really interesting concept . . 	0
OC	6142	What are you doing for the superbowl ? 	0
OC	6143	I ' m gonna be in the stir . 	0
OC	6144	I ' m going to be shopping on my way to work at 7am tomorrow morning because I fail and forgot my office christmas gifts , and then I have to go out and buy Dirty Santa presents on Christmas Eve - oh joy : / 	0
OC	6145	At least with girls , all you have to do is get them something shiny or something that smells good and they will be happy : ) Those pictures of the twins with their dog just made me melt < 333 Nothing is more attractive than a guy who is not afraid to show his love for his pets : ) Good luck catching up on your Christmas stuff . 	0
OC	6146	men are impossible to buy for and it ' s so frustrating ! ! 	0
OC	6147	That ' s crazy . 	0
OC	6148	I ' m jealous . 	0
OC	6149	I ' d fucking love to , but I ' ve already half-commited myself to a spur of the moment trip to NEWFOUNDLAND . 	0
OC	6150	WTF Are you going ? ! 	0
OC	6151	You can ' t really have that kind of set-up though , but a small office might get you pretty close . . . 	0
OC	6152	In a small office where my boss is my dad and I know the accountant pretty well , and I talk to the same fifteen subcontractors on the phone , it ' s not an overly social environment like most other jobs I ' ve had have been ( which is probably the main reason I don ' t have a rapidly developing ulcer right now ) , so I don ' t have to be that outgoing . 	0
OC	6153	About the job thing , I ' ve always just faked outgoing-ness . 	0
OC	6154	It ' s just all so out of control . 	0
OC	6155	I ' ve been listening to news less lately , too . 	0
OC	6156	Otherwise I ' ll just throw up or grind my teeth into little shards . 	0
OC	6157	Change the channel right away . 	0
OC	6158	Any time a Republican says something ? 	0
OC	6159	A friend of mine had the same problem now that we made a gift exchange last week , he had to give a gift to one of my male friends and no one could think of something for him ! 	0
OC	6160	I ' m bringing my gigantic tent , and so far it ' s just me in there . . . if anyone is desperate , and I like them . . . : ) 	0
OC	6161	Ooh , I love the paw one in particular ! 	0
OC	6162	It seems like all the jobs out there are sales , or customer service , and neither is pleasant . 	0
OC	6163	But probably that will be hard to find in this economy . 	1
OC	6164	I want to know more about the other kids too . 	0
OC	6165	I was thinking exactly what you were thinking about Glee . 	0
OC	6166	And the love triangle is a very boring one . 	0
OC	6167	ZZZZT ! ! ! 	0
OC	6168	" Nope--can ' t happen to me . . . " 	0
OC	6169	Well , maybe it ' s something about winter that causes these attempted thieves to lose 30 IQ points , and think they can steal that copper without getting that electric chair effect . 	1
OC	6170	So , there are apparently idiots in other places , but it ' s interesting that they ' re all in northern climes . 	0
OC	6171	Yet another Darwin Award . . . 	0
OC	6172	One isn ' t supposed to eat in the church . 	0
OC	6173	No one should have rolls in the church . 	0
OC	6174	That is so awesome . 	0
OC	6175	I hope it was CC ' d to Paul and Linda . 	0

OC	6181	not neil gaiman ' s house , i don ' t have a passport . 	0
OC	6182	oh motivation , you are illusive . 	0
OC	6183	true . 	0
OC	6184	Christianist lawmaking harms both the law and Christianity . 	0
OC	6185	The variety of " Christian " that would go around trying to codify the exclusivity of their beliefs into law has no more respect for atheists than it does for gays . 	0
OC	6186	Actually it was 10 : 30 . . . . but it didn ' t even wake up Ian ! 	0
OC	6187	Suffice it to say that I got sick of testing concrete products . 	0
OC	6188	I guess my complaint , then , is that your friend ' s ancestors couldn ' t spell . 	0
OC	6189	Nope , no reference . 	0

OC	6216	especially while looking for growing things ! 	0
OC	6217	yes nightwalking ! 	0
OC	6218	I never found mushrooms though , which would be cool . 	0
OC	6219	I used to make things called " night bouquets " which are pretty illegal ( or at least rude ) , where I ' d grab a flower from each storefront I passed until I had a bunch , and then I ' d gift it to someone who would look at it like " um , okay . . " 	0
OC	6220	Those extra ten seconds could come in handy later . 	0
OC	6221	And hey , I figure the quote feature is there for you to use , and taking advantage of it is just the sensible thing to do ! 	1
OC	6222	So helpful to both the viewer and any possible psychopaths waving guns around ! 	0
OC	6223	Garden State ? 	0
OC	6224	It ' s already been so long . 	0

OC	6228	I don ' t know if I ' ve said this to you before , but I really like how you draw things like hands and bodies ( not just your faces ! ) . 	0
OC	6229	Especially the neck and collar area . 	0
OC	6230	Ah oh man , XD ; ; I ' m sorry , but imagining the people who were next to you and their faces is really funny for some reason . 	0

OC	6301	I haven ' t jumped in on a meme of this type in a while , so why not . 	0
OC	6302	If you ' re looking for an honest answer , then I think it has to do with the confidence that being in a relationship brings . 	1
OC	6303	That confidence is attractive to other people . 	0
OC	6304	I definitely have had that same experience though . 	0
OC	6305	I ' ve gone for like 2 years without even a spare though from someone , but then , as soon as I start dating someone , they all come out of the woodwork . 	0

OC	6390	I grant you there ' s a certain amount of urban sniffery in those two perspectives on thot of truth in th my pserspective there ' s also a lot of truth in what they say that most people jibbering madly about the movie just don ' t want to deal with . 	0

OC	6480	Hm , well YepRoc ' s site is not online right now . 	0
OC	6481	maybe it ' s not that they didn ' t want to fuck you before , but just feel safer telling you once you ' re in a relationship and they can ' t really act on it ? 	1

OC	6486	It is streamable from YepRoc - - matter of fact I should update the post with a link to that . 	0
OC	6487	Wow , you didn ' t know ? 	0
OC	6488	I ' m so happy you ' ve decided as such . 	0
OC	6489	This is a great , great record . 	1
OC	6490	I keep hearing people say things like " best record since Element of Light " and " Best Record since I Often Dream of Trains " - - I ' m hesitant to say that kind of thing because I ' m not a critic ; but it is certainly in a league with Robyn ' s very best work . 	0

OC	6497	I ' ll have to ask Fay how she cooked their rooster - he turned out very tasty . 	1
OC	6498	What I take offense at is the suggestion there ' s something wrong with me for disliking the story ( and presumably by extension , the movie . ) 	0
OC	6499	Note that I ' m talking about the response to my opinion of this particular work in the aggregate , not necessarily or specifically yours . 	0
OC	6500	Whether or not the word " love " gets used or not , clearly there ' s supposedly passion in the story . . . but what does it do ? 	0
OC	6501	I take offense at the insinuation that I ' m some kind of traitor to the " Gay Cause " for thinking the story sucks and that the hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE . 	1
OC	6502	Passion moves fucking mountains and surmounts daunting difficulties . 	0
OC	6503	It ' s like getting a huge verbal buildup for a fireworks display that turns out to be a guy waving a couple of sparklers . 	0
OC	6504	And no , the story needn ' t have a " happy ending " in order to be satisfying . 	0

OC	6518	What ' s really pissing me off is watching a liberal reporter tour damaged areas of Lebanon with a representative of Hezbollah while he whines about what the Israelis are doing to their cities . 	1
OC	6519	WTF ? 	0
OC	6520	Maybe if your rag-headed leader hadn ' t ordered the invasion of Israel , and the kidnapping of troops they wouldn ' t be shelling the fuck out of your little hidey holes , which happen to be in civilian areas . 	0
OC	6521	Cowardly fucks . 	0
OC	6522	And the reporter is eating it up , when he should be kicking the fucker ' s ass for assuming the rest of the world is as stupid as they are . 	0
OC	6523	Oh , and the whiney ass , self-centered , American bitch that couldn ' t understand why she wasn ' t being evacuated immediately . 	0
OC	6524	" The Italians , and French got their people out . 	0

OC	6556	I ' ve just been tussling with that particularly poisonous variety of " feminist ally " , a Knight in Shining Armor . 	0
OC	6557	I ' d like to say I took him apart , but , while I believe I acquitted myself very well , I fear he missed the point altogether , and flounced with his complacence and his virtuously noble self-image unscathed . 	0
OC	6558	When I deal with them , I sound for all the world like a stereotypical grim-and-strident radical feminist - out come phrases like " sexist entitlement " and " male privilege " . 	0
OC	6559	Nope , I ' m definitely not a Fun Feminist when it comes to that . 	0
OC	6560	A Knight in Shining Armor is the sort of male self-described feminist ( or he may describe himself as a feminist ally , or some other term chosen to show that of course he ' d never usurp our movement - this one favors " radical pro-feminist " ) who is involved with feminism because he ' s Good and Noble , and will slay all the evil misogynistic patriarchal villains and make the world safe for womankind . 	0

OC	6697	I don ' t think this movie was shelved so much because of it ' s being offensive as much as it just being embarassingly badly done . 	1
OC	6698	I know that many animators have been pushing for some kind of official rerelease just because the segments with Brer Rabbit are just damn good animation , but otherwise it wasn ' t hugely financially or critically successful and really didn ' t quite fit next to other live action / animation hybrid family films like Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks on the Disney Classics shelves . 	0
OC	6699	The most labor any black person does is cooking , there ' s no bloody uprising , nobody is beaten , bought or sold . 	0
OC	6700	Remus does get a browbeating from the mother and grandmother for telling stories to the kid , and he does get very " no mam , yessum " humble and even depressed about it , but that ' s as bad as things get . 	0
OC	6701	Not bad as in imoral , but bad as in just poor quality . 	0
OC	6702	It ' s not ever overtly offensive or in any way compelling durring the live segments , but Remus does look tweeked out of his gord durring Zippadee Doo Dah and whenever the little boy cries his transforms into the vissage of a demon . 	0
OC	6703	thank you ! 	0
OC	6704	For two reasons : the animation is some of the best done character animation that exists and because the live action elements are VERY badly written , acted and directed . 	0
OC	6705	So yeah , my basic thoughts ? 	0

VG	7979	There are two real reason I started a couple of forums and they are both related to my former addiction to alcohol . 	0
VG	7980	The above is really some background first off . 	0
VG	7981	However when the problem took hold , the demise to my job and my health also began . 	0
VG	7982	Prior to having a problem I was a UK highly respected IT Consultant and was very successful . 	0
VG	7983	My health had suffered to the point where any job that I used to do was impossible as I am not allowed to drive due to seizures . 	0
VG	7984	Since getting over it nearly a year and a half ago now I had to decide what to do . 	0
VG	7985	The first was to find something to do with an aweful lot of spare time and to make some money ( cant live on freah air ) and so the original Parkweb Oracle site was launched and although it wasnt the kind of money I was used to it is enough to comfortable survive . 	1
VG	7986	But like I said 2 reasons . 	0
VG	7987	I wanted to give a little back to all of the people that helped me and stood by me through my addiction - I made a promise to them all when I was back on my feet so to speak I would do something to try and make a difference . 	0

VG	7990	Hence it can be maintained that the nationalization of a concern , or even of a whole industrial branch , is not a socialistic measure since the rest of the economy continues to be based on the principle of private initiative and of the market economy since the nationalized branch is itself subject to the discipline of the market , particularly by paying its way by means of sales rather than by means of subsidies from the state . 	1
VG	7991	The only point we want to stress is that , between a socialized economy and one certain branches of which have been nationalized , there is more than a quantitative difference . 	0

VG	7994	Thus initiating military action against Iraq is not a simple matter of honouring clear treaty obligations ( as in 1939 ; the case can be made , though with some awkwardness , for the first Gulf conflict ) , nor of rebutting direct aggression , territorial or economic or whatever , against ourselves . 	1
VG	7995	Strategy reorganised itself around a balance of terror , Mutually Assured Destruction . 	0
VG	7996	The post-Cold War period may have seen the dissolution of this strategic assumption ; but it has not taken us back to the age when nation states fought territorial campaigns . 	0
VG	7997	Hiroshima was the start of a process leading to the development of weaponry that made territorial struggles irrelevant . 	0
VG	7998	The long-distance delivery of weapons of mass destruction altered the character of war itself . 	0
VG	7999	The fact that the war was finally won in the East by tactics that had nothing to do with this ( the atomic bomb ) doesn ' t alter the circumstances in which the war began . 	0
VG	8000	It might , though , make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different . 	0
VG	8001	On the first aspect : the conflict that we undertook ( rightly , I believe ) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory . 	0
VG	8002	Both sides could ( and did ) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment ; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert , the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance . 	0

WTP	9665	Yes , facts are constituted through scientific consensus ( see Latour and Woolgar Â´ s superb ethnography , Laboratory Life ) . 	0

WTP	9670	they are not . 	0
WTP	9671	That both depend on scientific consensus does not make them the same , it only means they have ( at least ) one point of congruity . 	0

WTP	9683	Simply put , the claim , by Montaignier , is that it is possible to get rid of the infection with a good immune system , and this , made by someone of the stature of Montaignier , deserves a mention , perhaps in the treatment section . 	0

WTP	9686	Articles such as these often suffer from the conflict between , broadly , science and the humanities . 	1

WTP	10090	Secondly , you stated the flag isn ' t mentioned in the section . 	0
WTP	10091	In what way does the Irish Tri-Colour make any benefit to the article any more than the UK flag would ? 	0
WTP	10092	Thirdly , you say the flag represents something which has nothing to do with the island of Ireland . 	0
WTP	10093	Nor is the Irish Tri-Colour , at all . 	0
WTP	10094	Fourthly , you make comparison between the UK and EU . 	0
WTP	10095	Last I looked the flag represents something which has something to do with the north east section of the island of Ireland . 	0

WTP	10097	Fortunately , or perhaps unfortunately for some of the above comments , it isn ' t up to us , because that would be original research . 	1
WTP	10098	Wikipedia is not a gladiatorial venue for sorting out personal prejudices , however much it sometimes seems to be like that . 	0
WTP	10099	We should report what reliable sources have already stated , and leave it at that . 	0
WTP	10100	If there is difference between those sources , we report both and leave it up to our readers to make up their own minds . 	0
WTP	10101	It ' s not that we ' re actually short of multiple sources here . 	0
WTP	10102	Thanks ! 	0
WTP	10103	But the main issue here is the controversy section . 	0
WTP	10104	However , prejudicial editing such as this cannot go unchallenged . 	0
WTP	10105	I ' ll I ' m trying to say is that Pop should ( and used to ) be first than R&B . 	0

WTP	10109	Please see 	0
WTP	10110	The question , as stated above , is not whether it ' s relevant to the IDF , but whether it is undue weight and recentism . 	0
WTP	10111	The phrase as it has been preserved in recent edits reads : " The Roman Catholic Church , often referred to as the Catholic Church . . . " 	0
WTP	10112	This is always going to be a bone of contention , and it will produce constant " edit wars " for as long as the present construction is stuck to . 	0
WTP	10113	Multiple editors have altered it , mainly because the current format is considered misleading by many Catholics . 	0
WTP	10114	A second point is the first sentence of the article . 	0
WTP	10115	I would suggest something like : " The Roman Catholic Church , more officially termed the Catholic Church â¦ " 	1
WTP	10116	Assuming that the article title remains Roman Catholic Church , the first sentence still needs changing in order to be less misleading , and even offensive to some Catholics . 	1
WTP	10117	The problem here is that what has become the current construction implies ( wrongly ) that the official name of the Church is the Roman Catholic Church , and Catholic Church is an unofficial term . 	0
WTP	10118	The most recent edit has put : " The Catholic Church , often referred to by protestants as the Roman Catholic Church . . . " 	0
WTP	10119	I too am a musician , though I admittedly doubt that I ' m as studied as you say you are . 	0
WTP	10120	Neither that , nor the " friends and teachers " thing are particularly relevant here , however , as you still only seem to be talking about personal opinion . 	0
WTP	10121	If you want paragraphs about Sabbath at the beginning of an article , go to the Black Sabbath article . 	0
WTP	10122	This article is about heavy metal in general , and saying Sabbath is more important than Zeppelin and Deep Purple is utterly unverifiable . 	0
WTP	10123	What ' s more , anyone could easily shoot that argument down by pointing out that Zeppelin was doing it before Sabbath , and had even more commercial success . 	0
WTP	10124	In general articles , the information provided is more general and less specific . 	0
WTP	10125	In more specific articles , more specific information is appropriate . 	0
WTP	10126	I don ' t . 	0
WTP	10127	Not in this article . 	0
WTP	10128	No , not at the level of detail you are proposing . 	0
WTP	10129	Anyway , there ' s an alternate image of a pro-life gathering . 	0
WTP	10130	That said , my own personal concern for the pictures is the unintended Amerocentrism ; it would be nice to to have capture an image of activists in the abortion debate in another country . 	0
WTP	10131	Also , the current pair of pictures create a thematic juxtaposition , centred about two Washington landmarks . 	0
WTP	10132	For reference , my input is that she be listed R&B , reggae , pop , rock . 	0
WTP	10133	After all , " size isn ' t everything , " and many gatherings are considerably smaller affairs than the March for Life or March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
WTP	10134	I don ' t think that the relevancy of an issue can be judged from the apparent turnout in a picture of an isolated protest . 	1
WTP	10135	Another user above expressed the concern that the younger age of the pro-life demonstrators in the photo makes the pro-choice cause appear less current . 	0
WTP	10136	I think the issue is one of scale : the pro-life demonstration is by Bound for Life , a grassroots organization , while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
WTP	10137	Saying he " dictated " the Book of Mormon is a fairly neutral representation of what Smith did , and it takes no position on whether he was " translating " in a scientific sense , receiving text by revelation , or making it up as he went , all 3 of which are theoretically possible . 	1
WTP	10138	Highlighting one of those options or opinions , that it was " translated by the gift and power of God " , is not that important in the context of the sentence as a whole . 	0
WTP	10139	That claim can be and is covered elsewhere . 	0
WTP	10140	Plus it ' s just more wordy and doesn ' t flow as well as the original text . 	0
WTP	10141	I ' m having a very hard time seeing why the first would be preferable . 	1
WTP	10142	It seems to engage in subtle puffery , what with the " over 500 pages . . . in about 60 days " statement . 	0
WTP	10143	Why is this important to the statement ? 	0
WTP	10144	From my view , it ' s not , really . 	0
WTP	10145	Before that it was a patchwork of a wide variety of different forms of political entities ( some were countries in their own right ) . 	0

WTP	10152	- 	0
WTP	10153	That will get the " magic number " for GA ; but it should probably only be done if someone also feels it will improve the article . 	0
WTP	10154	If something needs to be sacrificed at the Good Article altar , my suggestion is that we reduce the epidemiological information ( much of paragraph 3 ) to about a sentence , and combine it with paragraph 4 . 	1
WTP	10155	Specifically , those who assert that it is too long should state what information there is superfluous or in some way detracts from the goal of the lede being a readable overview . 	0
WTP	10156	Therefore any criticism of its length should be based on content rather than an arbitrary number . 	0
WTP	10157	What the lede needs to be is a concise , readable overview of the article . 	0
WTP	10158	As for , # 1 : no , the lede doesn ' t need to be reduced to four paragraphs : four paragraphs is suggested as a guideline , with exceptions . 	1
WTP	10159	- - 	0
WTP	10160	It was an honest inquiry about bettering the quality of the article . 	0
WTP	10161	In my wake , you ' re making it sound like I was some raving manic voice of dissent . 	0
WTP	10162	The soft parts can be compared to the soft parts of an Opeth or Tool song ( both bands two prominent prog metal bands , heavily influenced by Sabbath and especially this album with its innovative heavy / soft approach ) , which , also , hold no blues influences . 	0
WTP	10163	They contain no blues influences at all , basically , and your already stated example is , as said , very poor . 	0
WTP	10164	The softer parts are soft ; neither the chord progressions , the song melodies , the guitar licks , or anything , contain any clear blues influences . 	0
WTP	10165	I wouldn ' t accept that sentence , among other reasons because Hamas is also fighting against the Israeli occupation of what we call Israel , which is not Palestinian land . 	1
WTP	10166	I would propose just taking a sentence from Encarta or Britannica . 	0
WTP	10167	I think it is important for the article to state this percentage to put the scandal in perspective . 	0
WTP	10168	The students were extremely surprised and relieved to know this fact . 	0
WTP	10169	If we are to mention the sex scandals in the lead , my suggestion would be to also include a percentage of total priests accused . 	0
WTP	10170	It is very unfair to all of the faithful , hardworking and self-sacrificing priests out there who are suffering from this misconception and my heart really hurts for them . 	0
WTP	10171	The church response and reforms were not covered by the press hardly at all and I think the aricle serves the public interest by making that known . 	0
WTP	10172	Reasons why I think sex scandals should be mentioned in the lead : I think the article ' s section covering the sex abuse scandal is one of the most important ones because of the recent controversy and press coverage over it . 	1
WTP	10173	In the Archdiocese of Miami the number was 1% of all priests who had worked here since 1950 . 	0
WTP	10174	In my religious education class , I asked the students what percentage of priests they thought had been accused of sexual misconduct and I got answers ranging from 30-50% . 	0
WTP	10175	Catholics have been persecuted more often than they have persecuted - all of these events are notable and relevent to the history of the Church and have been mentioned and wikilinked in the article as such . 	0
WTP	10176	This is not POV , this is following Wikipedia guidelines . 	0
WTP	10177	We cant say that an article is POV just because many instances of persecutions of Catholics are mentioned in greater number than persecutions by Catholics . 	1
WTP	10178	The facts of history bear out the fact that is how it is . 	0
WTP	10179	We can ' t eliminate those facts from the article without violating FA rules that require us to make mention of notable events . 	0
WTP	10180	Just as the Inquisitions are mentioned and the facts relating to the persecution of heretics is provided , so we have given equal treatment to all other persecutions relevant to the Catholic Church . 	0
WTP	10181	I would like to elaborate further on how this article is NPOV . 	0
WTP	10182	The facts regarding the persecutions of Catholics in England , Ireland and Wales are relevant facts that speak directly about the Catholic Church - how it was banned in those areas and people who resisted were dealt with in a particular way - persecutions . 	0
WTP	10183	If the article was not referenced to the top sources required by Wikipedia we could argue this but no one has offered a view of Catholic history different than what we have provided on the current page - even though I have searched for one in my diligent efforts to satisfy Karanacs . 	0

WTP	10201	Catholics are challenging the Pope about the sex abuse denial and not Anglicans or Protestants . 	1

WTP	10205	Why is the Bishop of Yakima relevant ? 	0
WTP	10206	This article does not even reflect the diverse opinions of Catholic churchgoers . 	0
WTP	10207	i see nothing wrong with including mention of the nations which dispute the " terrorist " label , in fact i think it is required . 	1
WTP	10208	you kept reverting that out . 	0
WTP	10209	i don ' t think any of this argument is necessary - obviously one man ' s terrorist is another man ' s freedom fighter , as WP : TERRORIST says . 	0

WTP	10219	And we need to make this specific to the inquisition we ' re talking about . 	0
WTP	10220	where ' s the controversy ? 	0
WTP	10221	And if we ' re talking about the Spanish Inquisition , and giving figures , then it is important to note that most of the Inquisition killings occurred in a twenty year period when the Inquisition was run by Torquemada and it was involved in the campaign against supposed false Moorish conversos under Ferdinand and Isabella . 	0
WTP	10222	Pope SIxtus condemned the Spanish Inquisitions procedures at this time , but was brow-beaten by Ferdinand into saying nothing more . 	0
WTP	10223	It could imply thst everyone tsken in by the inquisition was killed . 	0
WTP	10224	In fact the 3-4 , 000 figure is across the Spanish Empire , and over a period of 400 years . 	0
WTP	10225	As Kamen said , most local district courts in Europe executed far more people than the entire Spanish Inquisition over the period 1520 - 1820 . 	0
WTP	10226	wasn ' t this a big deal when the elections were going on ? 	0
WTP	10227	However , once again , the problem with going into this much detail would probably further unbalance the article . 	0

WTP	10320	If you wish to see proof of the extent of all parties " terrorism " actions / consequences , check the statistics section on this website . . . http://www.btselem.org/English/index.asp â¦ . 	0
WTP	10321	Having this statement in the initial / leading description of the " Hamas " wiki page implies that Hamas is more deserving of this label / view than their opposition ( israel ) , as this is not the method used in writing the " israel " wiki page . 	0
WTP	10322	In fact , if we want to define " terrorism activities " according to the Geneva Conventions , the government of israel is CLEARLY responsible for the majority of attacks / civilain deaths and injuries in the conflict , and there continued actions causing ( the majority of ) civilian casualties over the years is clear proof of THEIR vioaltion of Geneva Convention article 57 . 	0

WTP	10364	Instead of choosing military targets , they target civilians , in order to terrorize the population to get what they want . 	0
WTP	10365	They choose to pursue their cause by murdering civilians , with no military use . 	0
WTP	10366	As I ' ve explained , their method of willful , intentional killing of civilians is the most salient and important detail about them . 	1
WTP	10367	I didn ' t say " Hamas is a terrorist organization " ( though it is ) , but that it employs clear-cut terrorist tactics , which is 100% true and accurate , and not open to interpretation . 	0
WTP	10368	My position is to NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THEM -U . S . , israel , Hamas , PLO , South Africa , Canada , etc . It ' s not a secret that politicians lie â¦ . . 	0

WTP	10372	I must have missed the part in your response where you refuted my legal connection between the governing bodies of the U .

WTP	10373	@ " Okedem " I ' m sorry . . . . 	0
WTP	10374	Therefore , I repeat again , can you tell me why it is fair , balanced and logical to include the " terrorist " comment on the " Hamas " wiki page ( in the initial description ) whereas it is apparently not on the " U . S . " and " israel " wiki page ? 	0
WTP	10375	should be treated equally . 	0
WTP	10376	( and please don ' t refer me to the comments made by U .

WTP	10379	The first sentence of this section sounds awkward ( ask an editor who is not involved with WP and has no axe to grind about HIV ) and seems to bend over backwards to deny that anyone with any kind of biological credentials could possibly believe anything is missing from the current theory . 	0

WTP	10385	Let me start by saying I made a mistake in regard to " researchers " . 	1
WTP	10386	I had assumed from the journal citation in this section that Papadopulos was an HIV researcher . 	0
WTP	10387	It simply summarizes various viewpoints , providing a lot of nuance about why some scientists suspect cofactors , why some HIV-positive people refused treatment and then got it , why some doctors no longer deny HIV ' s role but still think something ' s incomplete . 	0
WTP	10388	So , I don ' t see a problem with POZ as a source to * report opinions * , which is basically what the first part of this section is doing , is it not ? 	1
WTP	10389	Secondary sources are actually preferable ( to my surprise ) , mainly because of usability and ease of checking . 	0
WTP	10390	POZ does not claim to be a scientific article ! 	0

WTP	10392	That said , Ros , there is strong precedence against shock images on this article ( Archive 14 , " Link to ' Aborted Children ' " , Archive 16 , " Linking to Images is Allowed " , Archive 20 , " Abortion Images / Links " . 	1
WTP	10393	Such images , in the context of the politically-charged Abortion article , would be more argumentative than informative â a violation of WP : NPOV . 	0

WTP	10397	The Sea People are assumed to have had the most impact on the coasts . 	0
WTP	10398	The current coastal people are genetically highly similar to their inland neighbors . 	0
WTP	10399	This misses the point . 	0
WTP	10400	In order to determine that a given population ' s genetic pool lacks a significant contribution from some other given population , one needs to know first what characterizes the genes of that other population - - in this case , the " Sea People . " 	0
WTP	10401	This is what " Tomer " means by knowing who they were . 	0
WTP	10402	As the genetic character of the Sea People cannot be be determined , screening definitively for it seems impossible . 	1
WTP	10403	Therefore it is unlikely the coastal people interbred with any outsiders to a greater degree than the inland people did . 	0
WTP	10404	While stronger , that still isn ' t a lock . 	1
WTP	10405	The tag ( s ) seem to have been removed ( probably correctly ) because the reasons for adding the tag are no applicable to the tag , or are unarticulated ( or poorly articulated ) or discussed and removed - much like many other articles in WP in fact . 	0
WTP	10406	Just because people disagree with the article doesn ' t mean it needs a tag . 	0
WTP	10407	At one time the point was to put priests on par with doctors , lawyers , etc . I ' ve been told that it has been loosened up in various dioceses , states , countries , etc . Some seminaries in the midwest are even non-accredited . 	0

WTP	10437	The child abuse scandals , or the RCC ' s positions on homosexuality , abortions , and euthanasia , are controversies that are well known outside of the RCC . 	0

WTP	10513	" Legendary " and " historical " do not show that Santa is a fable , a myth . 	1
WTP	10514	While we cannot ignore the historical underpinnings of the character , we cannot - with respect to those who believe wholeheartedly in the Flying Fat Man - escape that the wacky stories and abilities attributed to the fellow are beyond those of mortal men . 	0
WTP	10515	Much like the aforementioned example of the Easter Bunny , Santa is a mythical character . 	1
WTP	10516	However , the greater part of the character is fantastical , with enough powers and abilities to make Superman envious . 	0
WTP	10517	1 Santa has a roughly factual grounding with some embellishment , like Abe Lincoln or Johnny Appleseed ; this makes the character legendary . 	0
WTP	10518	An endorsement of LDS theology like this is not acceptable under the WP : NPOV rule . 	0
WTP	10519	In addition , whether or not the AAF is a reliable source is not the question--the issue is whether or a link to their website is a reliable source . 	0
WTP	10520	I am guessing no one is up for that . 	0
WTP	10521	Therefore , I think that mythological is the best we are going to get , when the clear alternative would be to scientifically dismiss the character as an indigestion-inspired hallucination ( " more gravy than grave to it " , to paraphrase Scrooge ) . 	0
WTP	10522	As to citing the LDS website , such citations are generally only appropriate in order to document official LDS positions or perspectives . 	0
WTP	10523	To show the " truth " of something , it is more problemmatic , and you would want to cite something that has been peer reviewed . 	0
WTP	10524	I don ' t think it is , because we know nothing about the editorial process and any peer review other than the fact that the web page was " compiled by [ unnamed ] AAF editors " . 	1

WTP	10526	I am not claiming that it * is * pseudoscience , what I am stating is the fact that it has been characterized as being unfalsifiable , if you do not believe that this then constitutes similitude with pseudoscience I suggest you go rewriting [ Falsifiability ] and [ scientific method ] then come back here . 	1

WTP	10624	In the days before the creation of Israel ( and the mass emigration of sephardic Jews from Islamic Arab countries to Israel ) it was not that unusual for a Sephardic Jewish woman to marry a Muslim man , and in fact , a Jewish ( or Christian ) woman would not be required to convert to Islam to marry a Muslim man under Islamic law ( though a Muslim woman many only marry a Muslim though she may marry a Muslim convert and a woman from another religion not considered a " people of the book " like Jews or Christians would have to convert before Islamic law will recognize the marriage ) . 	1
WTP	10625	Given the other account , that his mother converted to Islam at 9 years old , it may not be clear if his mother was from the grandmother ' s first marriage to the Jewish man or from the second marriage to the sheikh . 	0
WTP	10626	Apparently , according to the Israeli media , under Jewish halachic law , to be a Jew one must be born to a Jewish mother or convert to Judaism . 	1

WTP	10786	You are being patient and nice , and I appreciate that . 	0
WTP	10787	You directed me to a section of the NPOV policy dealing with undue weight , which exactly clarifies the point that I am making : " An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject , but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject . 	0
WTP	10788	Our argument is about what constitutes a notable controversy in a WP article on the Roman Catholic Church , and my position is that the sex abuse scandals don ' t make the cut because so many other controversies in the church are so much more notable . 	1
WTP	10789	Given the 2000 year history of the church , and all the things associated with the church , I ' d say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight , based on prominence of placement . 	1
WTP	10790	Note that undue weight can be given in several ways , including , but not limited to , depth of detail , quantity of text , prominence of placement , and juxtaposition of statements " ( emphasis added ) . 	0
WTP	10791	If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy ( and it is not clear to me that it does ) , I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal , although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church , and much more encyclopedia-worthy , to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum . 	0
WTP	10792	Like I said before , if it ' s necessary for FA , I ' m not going to stand in the way , but it looks to me like it violates several WP policies . 	0

WTP	10843	So if I personally were describing corrupt abominable people , I might use the word ' sect ' also . 	0
WTP	10844	One thing to consider is that Joseph Smith declares that the dispensation that he proclaims is a restoration of the Truth , and for everyone else - - " all their creeds were an abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt " . 	0
WTP	10845	Either way , he said the word ' sect ' and so unless you have some clear evidence that it didn ' t mean sect , then it should say ' sect ' . 	1
WTP	10846	We can assume he knows no distinction and just switches terms constantly , or we can assume he deliberately chooses the terms . 	0
WTP	10847	So , Smith uses a lot of different terms back and forth . 	0
WTP	10848	In the lines leading up to the passage where Smith describes his experience in the official Joseph Smith-History from LDS , Smith uses various words to describe religion and religious things . 	0

WTP	10855	I happened by a statement that uses the phrase remained under British sovereignty in the context of NI . 	0
WTP	10856	This is in the Judgment of the Court of Human Rights in the " Lawless v Ireland " case in 1961 which states on page 4 of the judgment in the " As to the Facts " section : " Under the Treaty establishing the Irish Free State , signed on 6th December 1921 between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State , six counties in the North of the Island of Ireland remained under British sovereignty . " 	0
WTP	10857	Considering that the case was defended by the then Attorney General of Ireland Aindrias Ã Caoimh one could reasonably expect the facts to be as viewed by the state itself . 	1
WTP	10858	Perhaps using that phrase would be preferable to any UK word use and you even have a decent reference to substantiate it and those are lawyers speaking . 	1
WTP	10859	I think it ' s important to recognize though that this is an area where potentially we might have compromised and - and arrived at a bill that dealt with the narrow concerns about how a - a previable fetus or child was treated by a hospital . 	0
WTP	10860	I recognize this is a passionate issue , and so I - I won ' t , as I said , belabor the point . 	0
WTP	10861	And if we ' re placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a previable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as - as is necessary to try to keep that child alive , then we ' re probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality . 	0
WTP	10862	Viability is the line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court to determine whether or not an abortion can or cannot take place . 	0
WTP	10863	The second reason that it would probably be found unconstitutional is that this essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a previable child , or fetus , however way you want to describe it . 	0
WTP	10864	For that purpose , I think it would probably be found unconstitutional . 	0
WTP	10865	It was . 	0
WTP	10866	I suggested to Members of the Judiciary Committee that it was unconstitutional and it would be struck down by the Seventh Circuit . 	0
WTP	10867	I recall the last time we had a debate about abortion , we passed a bill out of here . 	0
WTP	10868	Now , as I said before , this probably won ' t make any difference . 	0
WTP	10869	Tenacious misunderstandings are quite a bit more of a problem . 	0
WTP	10870	Contentious misunderstandings â say , using an editorial argument ( and its alleged abandonment ) as a platform to criticize a page or the project as a whole , and in doing so using it as a kicking-off place for several other misunderstandings â is a different , though at this page no less common , problem . 	0

WTP	10896	Does anyone here disagree with that ? 	0
WTP	10897	Now that ' s basically my position at the present time , keeping in mind that personal opinions are not what determines content here , but on talk pages we do benefit from exploring the issues involved and explaining why we do or do not support the inclusion or formatting of certain matters . 	0

WTP	11216	So , instead of including random people doing their own translations , or even the President ' s own staff , who are all Iranian Farsi speakers , we should be focusing on people who 1-are trusted masters of both languages , and 2-are trusted to not slant the original meaning . 	0

WTP	11243	Now , logical assessment will lead you to conclude that this is just semantics and that countries committing the same acts as " terrorists " would also fall into the category of " terrorism " . . . . . . . . it ' s just that the U .

WTP	11313	So to recap , it seems like you need to explain how you ' re not running against WP : EL # ADV and WP : ELNO ' s # 4 , 10 , and 11 ; if you can ' t get any editors who regularly use Wikipedia to comment in your favour here , perhaps you should seek redress via Wikipedia : Third opinion as your last resort in getting this put to bed . 	0

WTP	11346	Indeed , I could complain about some parts of the article as it is , The section on the Reformation contains some highly critical comments : The most famous scholar of the age , Erasmus , in 1509 wrote In Praise of Folly which captured a widely held opinion about corruption in the church . [ 189 ] Abuses of power , usury , clerical wealth and hypocrisy all contributed to a general feeling among educated people that reform of some sort was necessary . [ 189 ] In 1517 , Martin Luther included his Ninety-Five Theses in a letter to several bishops , hoping to spark debate . [ 190 ] His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences . [ 190 ] Huldrych Zwingli , John Calvin , and others further criticized Catholic teachings . 	1
WTP	11347	These challenges developed into the Protestant Reformation . 	0
WTP	11348	I could object to some of this , Martin Luther inttended to spark more than debate when he posted his theses . 	0
WTP	11349	and there are none of the many negatives about him here ( anti-semitism , allowing bigamy , coercion , sanctining slaying of the peasants ) . 	0

WTP	11387	In regards to the back and forth here , I think the reasons for hesitation on inclusions of these types of things are legit , and Scjessey ' s response ( while it does look POVish ) is based on the fact that there were editors here wanting to included everything negative pushed at Obama during the first months of his presidency . 	1

WTP	11488	Perhaps something from earlier history - even very ancient history , would be more appropriate , avoiding the problems of politics , over-attention to recent history ( there are three images related to recent wars involving America , any more than one is too many ) and preferably not so gruesome . 	0
WTP	11489	The image we had before , and I reverted the addition of this image once already , was Peter Fechter dying on the Berlin Wall , though that ' s from a period after the war had ended , so I ' d rather not use that as the ' final ' image for the section . 	1

WTP	11491	Also think about this from a political view - Chinese people may be highly offended by the image . 	0
WTP	11492	It seems a little over the top - Wikipedia is not censored , but do we need to use such a gruesome image to prove a point ? 	0

WTP	11533	I would not put Cartman ' s mom in the same class of characters as SKCK , even though she has often had as much screen-time as any one of thm and is sometimes central to the plot . 	0
WTP	11534	The show has a large supporting cast of characters some of whom become more or less prominent depending on the episode - and we can through in the eight parents , and Ike , while we are at it . 	0
WTP	11535	South prk revolves around the relationshps among Stan , Kyle , Cartman and Kenny , sometimes through their separate adventures . 	0

WTP	11537	When you removed " main " from Butters , you removed it for the other four . 	0
WTP	11538	When these characters were identified as main , you added " main " to Butters . 	0
WTP	11539	The issue is not whether or not Butters is identifid as a " main " character , the question is whether Butters is given the sam prominence as Stan , Kyle , Cartman , and Kenny . 	0

WTP	11548	I found " Zionist Regime " and other descriptions instead . 	0
WTP	11549	I might as well address this point now : as I had said above the pictures of abortion are pretty NPOV to begin with . 	0
WTP	11550	Pictures displayed matter-of-factly that somehow evoke pity or sympathy do not mean that they can ' t ever be displayed without sharing a point ; they just draw upon innate emotions . 	0
WTP	11551	As was said above I realize this is already a touched upon issue and my comment is nothing new to the argument but I was wondering why is there no actual picture of an abortion / post aborted fetus on this page ? 	0
WTP	11552	The picture is only as POV as the messages following it as I ' ve seen many proponents of abortion openly share them and declare they are worthless appeal to emotion in the context of abortion debate . 	1
WTP	11553	Regardless , they ' re neutral outside debate and it ' s curious an entire article on ABORTION has no picture of such despite the fact they clearly exist . 	0

WTP	11561	As an aside , I seriously hope that we do not include scientology as sources regarding psychiatry , there is simply no need and it detracts from the case made by ' actual scientists and medical professionals ' . 	0
WTP	11562	Aliens in DC-10s notwithstanding , scientology have made themselves notable when they have the likes of Tom Cruise decrying psychiatry on prime-time tv . 	0
WTP	11563	This would defuse the oncoming impasse and allow readers to judge for themselves if they consider the sources authoritative . 	0
WTP	11564	I think we should consider properly attributing claims to their sources in-text . 	1
WTP	11565	As I mentioned above , there is no visible context in the picture showing that it has anything to do with either the West Bank or the Gaza Strip . 	0

WTP	11568	It is a picture of four men , two in uniform , holding rifles . 	0
WTP	11569	As such it is an excellent illustrative photo of militantism in Israeli culture or the citizen-soldier nature of the IDF but not relevant to a general article about the IDF or an article about a specific location . 	1

WTP	11579	The stones and trees will say O Moslems , O Abdulla , there is a Jew behind me , come and kill him . 	0
WTP	11580	Only the Gharkad tree , ( evidently a certain kind of tree ) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews . 	0
WTP	11581	That said , I still fail to see what you ' re positing as the source of diversity . 	0
WTP	11582	Let ' s assume we mean ' speciation ' when we talk about ' diversity ' . 	0
WTP	11583	Anyway , that ' s obviously a semantic argument that ' s not worth having . 	0
WTP	11584	Drift and selection in that context act AGAINST the existing diversity , produced by mutations , and can only result in eventual fixation - that is , the elimination of variation . 	0
WTP	11585	If you just mean ' variation ' , e . g . the diversity evident within the human population , then you are wrong . 	1
WTP	11586	Also , I ' m unclear on how you ' re using ' diversity ' - if you mean strictly speciation , then I ' ll agree that drift and selection are important forces that are required to produce speciation , since one couldn ' t have fixation / divergence without them by definition . 	1
WTP	11587	I ' m unclear on what you mean . 	0
WTP	11588	I suppose I am confused , then - could you specify what these different lines of evidence are , one supporting common descent and the other supporting biodiversity ? 	0
WTP	11589	I agree that we don ' t need more discussion about editors themselves . 	0
WTP	11590	Let ' s all stick to the topic at hand . 	0

WTP	11610	Not knowing exactly what a " zionist entity " was I went to the page . 	0

WTP	11709	Culture is of more interest to me than genetics - - though genetics can be of enormous help in tracking the movements of known or likely carriers of culture . 	0
WTP	11710	So what ' s of more interest to me is that Phoenician culture is so clearly derived from Canaanite . 	0
WTP	11711	Furthermore , some of the groups referred to by a single name in our records were composed of people of very diverse background . 	0
WTP	11712	So the relative genetic uniformity of coastal and inland Levantines only requires that any significant input from outside has been pretty much equally distributed between those regions over time . 	0

WTP	11727	Can we have a section on Mass that is not an angry commentary ? 	0
WTP	11728	I am glad Vatican II changed the Tridentine Mass allowing the vernacular - I want to understand what is happening on the altar and be included in the actual celebration , not just in my bodily presence but in my heart - that is kind of hard to do when you dont understand the language . 	0

WTP	11732	You seem to be asserting that if the scientific community comes to a consensus that something is a pseudoscience that is not enough for inclusion here as a pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	11733	However , this is essentially what defines a pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	11734	More specifically a consensus is formed based on evidence whether or not something is true and then if people continue to advanced failed arguments and evidence they are practicing pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	11735	There is therefore no better why of deciding on pseudoscience than by looking at the scientific consensus of whether someone is advocating a tenable position or not . 	1

WTP	11789	A bias to hide relevant information is sinister - and what wikipedia is NOT all about . 	0
WTP	11790	The strong desire to keep images of what an abortion is hidden speaks volumes about those who possess it . 	0
WTP	11791	The strong desire to make such images available to more people ( rather than suppressed ) is to be lauded by all who favor enlightenment and decision-making based on fully informed decision-makers . 	0
WTP	11792	I forget what the last word was . 	0
WTP	11793	Abortion is a common surgery . 	0

WTP	11815	- - 	0
WTP	11816	I for one do not think that the controversy / criticism section needs to be any bigger than any one of the history , structure or equipment sections . 	1
WTP	11817	There are also multiple organizations , notably Breaking the Silence , that deal specifically with this issue ( see above discussion with Deborahjay ) , and there is a main article for the recent controversy . 	0
WTP	11818	If we included even a small paragraph for every controversy of a similar scope to the recent soldiers ' testimonies , we ' d easily get a 100K section only for criticism , because there were a series of such testimonies after each major operation , and some of the notable cases are listed here . 	1

WTP	11822	A MVA Manual_vacuum_aspiration , with WHO ( anybody know their copyright status ? ) pictures at [ [ 9 ] ] , makes it pretty clear that even surgically induced abortions are fairly simple , and not even that interestingly graphic . 	0
WTP	11823	Mostly my sense of bemused irritation comes from folks who want to portray all natural , surgical , and pharmaceutical procedures similarly . 	0
WTP	11824	I can agree with that ( while also noting that the most widely used form of induced fertilized egg / blastocyst / fetus rejections are pharmaceutical , not surgical , in nature ) , but could that mean that the article is lopsided , or how we use pictures in the article is lopsided , or what ? 	0
WTP	11825	Ronabop , I think it ' s clear that most of the article is about induced abortion , as is most of the debate over the issue . 	0
WTP	11826	While seeing such things doesn ' t really bother me all that much ( having fed a good 20-30 fetuses to coyotes in my life , and consuming at least a few hundred . . . life on a farm an all ) , I ' m divided on how to present the subject , images , and article , properly in a NPOV manner . 	0
WTP	11827	However , I can understand their motivations , in that they are wishing to " humanize " and " personalize " , abortion , and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images . 	0
WTP	11828	To repeat a refrain , many who have asked for ( and suggested ) pictures are * not * asking for pictures of an abortion procedure , or process , they are asking for gore pictures of a dead human fetus , which is not what this article is about , subject-wise ( Though it could be , if the article was renamed Human aborted fetuses ) . 	0
WTP	11829	There has been an attempt to build consensus for what are reasonable deviations from the US place name guideline . 	0

WTP	11850	The statement is potentially inaccurate and certainly unwise to feature in the lead . 	0
WTP	11851	Putting this in the lead will just cause more vandalism to the article than there is now ( which is already substantial ) . 	0
WTP	11852	The lead is supposed to be a summary of the body of the article , not an independent editorial . 	0
WTP	11853	Again what were the negative aspects of the MISSIONS ? 	0
WTP	11854	Very little is said about Henry ' s persecutions - or what happened in Ireland Vague criticism . 	0
WTP	11855	Just as America points to a broader page , rather then the USA , and just like Orthodox Church points to something broader than the Eastern Orthodox Church , so too Catholic Church should follow this precedent . 	0

WTP	11863	So I guess the issue is , roughly : Is the phrase " characterized as " equivalent to " which are characterized as " ( a present-tense passive-voice adjectival clause ) ? 	0
WTP	11864	But as I also said , I believe editors should attempt to be collectively clearer , i . e . to arrive at some kind of consensus about what the scope of the list is in this regard . 	0

WTP	11878	Nowhere in this Wiki are there references to the original publications claiming to have isolated HIV . 	0
WTP	11879	I also agree that there should be two separate pages : One for HIV , and another for AIDS , as while they may be intrinsically linked in the cause and effect consensus , they are NOT the same thing . 	1
WTP	11880	There are people who test HIV + who have NEVER developed AIDS and these case start in the 80 ' s . 	0

WTP	11899	Wassupwestcoast , there are some serious flaws in your new rewrite , references numbers 225 and 226 do not support the sentence they reference and number 226 is not a news article , it is an opinion piece which are not OK refs in Wikipedia . 	1

WTP	11990	I think we ' re running into the same thing we run into on all political Wikipedia articles . 	1
WTP	11991	The argument consistently is " well , this guy has all this criticism , so why doesn ' t this guy get equal amount ? " 	0
WTP	11992	The problem is , that ' s not how balance works . 	1
WTP	11993	You don ' t balance out articles by putting the same amount of criticism in one because this much is in the other , anymore than you determine how many characters , pictures or quotes appear in each article . 	0

WTP	12010	" Number one , whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the Constitution , what we ' re really saying is , in fact , that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a - a child , a nine-month-old - - child that was delivered to term . 	0
WTP	12011	Unfortunately , this bill goes a little bit further , and so I just want to suggest , not that I think it ' ll make too much difference with respect to how we vote , that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny . " 	0
WTP	12012	And there was some suggestion that we might be able to craft something that might meet constitutional muster with respect to caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion . 	0
WTP	12013	" Well , it turned out - that during the testimony a number of members who are typically in favor of a woman ' s right to choose an abortion were actually sympathetic to some of the concerns that your - you raised and that were raised by witnesses in the testimony . 	0
WTP	12014	Is that correct ? " 	0
WTP	12015	And one of the concerns that came out in the testimony was the fact that they were not being properly cared for during that brief period of time that they were still living . 	0
WTP	12016	According to the IL Senate transcripts , which links I just included , Obama ' s reasons for opposing the bills can be seen as follows , from his words posted verbatim : " Senator O ' Malley , the testimony during the committee indicated that one of the key concerns was - is that there was a method of abortion , an induced abortion , where the - - the fetus or child , as - as some might describe it , is still temporarily alive outside the womb . 	0
WTP	12017	As for # 1 , if you mean Obama was opposing the bills on state ' s rights , then you ' re wrong , and I ' m not sure where you are getting your sources . 	1
WTP	12018	I mean , it - it would essentially bar abortions , because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child , then this would be an antiabortion statute . 	0
WTP	12019	That determination then , essentially , if it was accepted by a court , would forbid abortions to take place . 	0
WTP	12020	Basically , Pop is her main genre . 	1

WTP	12028	RG , you state certainties , except when you say that Zeppelin are without a doubt a metal band . 	1
WTP	12029	They have one foot in the hard rock genre , and the other in the blues genre , together with the influences you mention , and I would hesitantly include heavy metal among those influences , because none of their albums are actual heavy metal ; they don ' t have it as an overhanging concept , but they do have heavy metal-ish ( I ' d say hard rock ) songs in their albums , like " Whole Lotta Love " and " Immigrant Song " . 	0
WTP	12030	And no , that ' s not slander . 	1

WTP	12180	It has been strenuously argued that as Ahmadinejad ' s own website translated the speech as " wiped of the map " that that is the term that should be used here , despite RS ' s translating it correctly as " eliminated from the pages of history " , similarly Ahmadinejad ' s website also says " the regime occupying Jerusalem " . 	0
WTP	12181	You rejected the RS to support wiped off the map because his own website says that but you then object to using occupying regime because you want to use Zionist regime . 	0

WTP	12195	You want to use " wiped of the map " because that was how Ahmadinejad ' s own people translated it yet you seem to be rejecting the same standard for " Zionist regime " . 	0
WTP	12196	Regime does not carry the same pejorative meaning and means a government not a state ( it is clear from any translation that Ahmadinejad meant government ) so clearly they can not be interchangeable . 	1
WTP	12197	Firstly , the wiki page says using entity is " a pejorative for the State of Israel " . 	0
WTP	12198	A search finds 63 , 000 results for entity being used in a translation of the speech ( mostly op-eds and blogs with a few conservative newspapers ) and 357 , 000 results for " Zionist Regime " being used in a translation of the speech ( a large number of mainstream media including Haaretz , CNN , Washington Post , NYT and BBC etc ) . 	0

WTP	12220	Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided . 	1
WTP	12221	Of course they take their view of Catholicism from a sensationalistic press rather than going to the source which says a homosexual must be treated with respect , compassion and sensitivity , also unjust disrcimination against them is wrong . 	0

WTP	12226	I have found in the past that no matter how notable a criticism of Obama , or how well-sourced it may be , that the editors on the Obama page will fight it tooth and nail , bringing in other liberal editors from elsewhere on Wikipedia and then claiming ' consensus ' regardless of past editors who provided opposite consensus who just aren ' t present at the time . 	1

WTP	12232	As to confusing , while BP is , as you say , the operator of the well , Transocean is the operator of the rig and Transocean is the driller of the well ; it technically isn ' t an operating well until the drilling rig sails off and a production rig comes in . 	0
WTP	12233	BP is the client , but Transocean is the captain of the ship ( rig / platform ) . 	0
WTP	12234	The Macondo Prospect isn ' t a well , it ' s an oil field . 	0
WTP	12235	What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean ( allegedly faultily , with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks , indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout ) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton ( allegedly shoddily ; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years ; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year ) . 	0

WTP	12254	if your answer is yes , I await your edit to the page ( as I see you have done much editing to it , and will leave it to you ) and will not argue about having this information described in the first paragraph of the " Hamas " page . 	0
WTP	12255	For example , would you agree that in the first paragraph of the " israel " wiki page , it would state that the majority of the Palestinian population and millions of other people around the world regard israel as one of the biggest terrorist states ? ? 	0
WTP	12256	No one here is opposing the idea of including the ( false ) labels that people want to attribute to Hamas , we are just asking for the same treatment as is given to other governing bodies on wikipedia . 	1
WTP	12257	Before they were elected , maybe it would have seemed logical to include this type of view in the first paragraph , but not now , since the main subject surrounding the group ( for the people it represents i . e . the Palestinians ) pertains to it ' s legal standing as a minority government . 	0
WTP	12258	Thank you for moving my comment . . . . . as for the discussion , if you agree that the wiki page for " United States " should state in the first paragraph that it is considered by millions of people around the world as the biggest terrorist state , then I see no problem in doing this with Hamas ' wiki page . 	0

WTP	12801	We both confide apparently in strict terminology , a prerequisite to good science - but be aware that such can be a hindrancewhen talking to the populace , especially when they associate with their everyday use of the word theory something that is on par with god and the scientists crazed notion of knowing virtually nothing except their own keen striving to get their mugshot in the press so the messages about new religious revelations is underminded - and be it so much as to not make the front page . 	0

WTP	12810	There is no justification to support a controversy section , unless I ' m missing something , right ? 	0
WTP	12811	America and Britain have engaged in extensive occupations in many countries and neither of their articles contain any sort of " controversy " section describing them . 	0
WTP	12812	The controversy section has little to do with the " occupation . " 	0

WTP	12814	Some people have shown impatience with the listing of Catholic positives in the article . 	0
WTP	12815	Then a historian who wondered how these Spanish torture devices had reached Sussex discovered not only that the Spanish Inquisition never used these type of devices , but that they were all local and British-made . 	0
WTP	12816	The point is that a balance has to be achieved between positive and negative . 	0
WTP	12817	These were immediately labelled and put into the local museum as " Torture devices of the Spanish Inquisition . " 	0
WTP	12818	For decades people looked at them and tutted in horror at the evils of the Catholic Church . 	0
WTP	12819	Many people ' s views of the Catholic Church have been formed by the " cold-war " propaganda of past eras , which sought to demonize Catholicism through spin and exaggeration . 	1
WTP	12820	A typical example of how this leads people to assume the worst was when some instruments of torture were found in a castle in Sussex 100 years ago . 	0

WTP	12838	So , when describing a controversy that has been given the label " denialism " ( a contortion of the English language ) , why is it a " misrepresentation " or " distortion " of a * scientific * WP article to focus on * scientists * in that section ? 	0

WTP	12851	A brief scan through parts of the article reveals some dubious points : In 1521 , the first Catholics were baptized in what would become the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia , the Philippines . [ 171 ] The following year , Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico , although they did not begin large-scale baptisms until 1537 , when Pope Paul III determined that the indigenous peoples did have souls . [ 174 ] Over the next 150 years , the missions expanded into southwestern North America . [ 175 ] The native people were legally defined as children , and the priests took on a paternalistic role , often enforced with corporal punishment . [ 176 ] In India , Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among a Christian community which had been established by Thomas the Apostle . [ 177 ] I find a lot of this information very dubious . 	1
WTP	12852	Huge numbers were converted in Mexico before 1537 , and I don ' t think there was much serious debate over whether Indians had souls . 	0
WTP	12853	WHO legally defined native people as children , Church , Governments ? 	0
WTP	12854	Where and when ? 	0
WTP	12855	" Corporal punishment " applied to everyone who wasn ' t a noble up until fairly recent times . 	0

WTP	12982	Remember , this is not a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of characterizations . 	0
WTP	12983	This perpetrates the inherent bias of this article ' s inclusion criteria which allows for characterizations made by certain notable organizations and people , but disallows characterizations made by other organizations and people just as notable . 	0
WTP	12984	Because some editors feel that these organizations and researchers are in themselves pseuodskeptical and / or pseudoscientific , thus they are ill-equipped to label something a pseudoscience and therefore their views on what they characterize to be a pseudoscience should not be included in this list . 	0
WTP	12985	Why ? 	0
WTP	12986	Recent attempts to include significant views of certain notable organizations , notable academics and notable researchers have been summarily eliminated and denied from this article . 	0
WTP	12987	So , why are we including the characterizations made by these researchers and organizations , but excluding - and moreover disallowing - the characterizations made by other researchers and organizations . 	0
WTP	12988	While per WP : PSCI only a general consensus in the scientific community can truly label a topic as pseudoscience , this article includes entries of topics which have only been characterized as a pseudoscience by one researcher or by one skeptical organization and not the general scientific community . 	0

WTP	13048	In any case , I ' m hesitant to call Obama Muslim based on the fourth-grade , partially for ethical reasons , as I don ' t believe in labelling children by religion before they can make a conscious decision , but also because multiple sources ( of which DfMF , AoH , or both , are included ) state that Lolo Soetoro and Ann Dunham emphasised comparative religion over indoctrination . 	1

WTP	13062	The Vatican sees itself in direct competition with Islam . 	0

WTP	13235	This one isn ' t going to gain consensus for sure . 	0
WTP	13236	The least disruptive course , I think , is to warn the IP ( the registered editor has already rejected warnings ) and close down the discussion threads that have no reasonable likelihood of leading to edits that improve the encyclopedia . 	0
WTP	13237	I ' ve already stricken and deleted some soapboxing and personal attacks , which has lead to some stalking tit-for-tat behavior . 	0
WTP	13238	Move to close - we ' re getting hit simultaneously by two trolling accounts . 	0

WTP	13240	The bottom line is that the implications within the two pictures are far too obvious . 	0
WTP	13241	The fact is that plenty of distasteful picketing occurs on both sides ( see http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2003/0301/protest0121.jpg ) and that silent and subdued protests are far and few between when it comes to topics this fervently debated . 	1
WTP	13242	Specifically , the fact that the pro-life protest is shown as modest and subdued whereas the pro-choice protest is depicted as obnoxious and fervent . 	0
WTP	13243	While the details are not really that relevant ( the fact that one picture contains attractive people in their mid-20 ' s and the other is a badly compressed image of 30-40 year-olds ) the subjects ' activities are . 	0
WTP	13244	Its also worth pointing out that the rally picture is of a much lower quality . 	1
WTP	13245	The one displaying pro-life supporters shows young men and women holding a silent vigil , whereas the pro-choice representation shows older people rallying and picketing obnoxiously . 	0
WTP	13246	I think the two pictures displayed alongside the " Abortion Debate " headline within the article are a bit ridiculous . 	1
WTP	13247	Take Care 	0

WTP	13249	Snare , he didn ' t say when your heart stops your brain instantly decomposes . 	1

WTP	13266	I think that saying Zeppelin isn ' t metal is kind of outrageous , too . 	0
WTP	13267	Not as outrageous to me as saying Sabbath aren ' t , but that ' s primarily because -as historically and musically questionable as it is - the ' Zeppelin aren ' t / weren ' t metal ' thing is common enough to be taken seriously in the common mind . 	0
WTP	13268	I have a few friends who I expect know more about music-on-paper than I do ( I mostly play by ear ) and I ' d be glad to ask them about this . 	0
WTP	13269	" And I don ' t know who you ' ve been talking to , but saying Sabbath isn ' t metal is kind of outrageous , " And yet it ' s a common enough opinion . 	0

WTP	13275	To quote the article , " The three companies that insure the majority of Protestant churches in America say they typically receive upward of 260 reports each year of young people under 18 being sexually abused by clergy , church staff , volunteers or congregation members . " 	0
WTP	13276	The Kingdom of Ireland most certainly wasn ' t the " United Kingdom " after partition ! 	0
WTP	13277	so . . . . you claim that israel ' s agenda is not to kill civilians , and then when someone references just that , you waive it aside as if it doesn ' t count ? 	0
WTP	13278	how about this for a reference . . . . . http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/789876.html . . . or this . . . http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1150885985413 . . . warning people that you are going to bomb / attack and telling them to leave their neighborhoods , and then going ahead with the attack regardless of whether they leave or not is by definition " targeting civilians " . . . . . . . arguing over semantics is going to leave you running in circles . . . . . . when you KNOW your actions will result in civilian deaths . . . . in the real world , that ' s called " targeting civilians " . . . . . . . oh . . . . by the way . . . . . . . where is it that you reference from when you claim that Hamas " targets civilians " ? 	0
WTP	13279	because from their mouth , I don ' t see anything that says that . . . . . . but I may be wrong . . . . . . . p . s . targeting what you consider " enemy combatants / forces " is by definition NOT civilians â¦ . 	1

WTP	13283	I think the fact you think they can ' t be shows a need for further education . 	0

WTP	13287	I have changed user name to reflect the requirements of yet another self-appointed editor to remove reference to LAShTAL . COM and am happy to change that yet again . 	0
WTP	13288	This is a wholly unreasonable attempt to delte a link that the user presumably fears might be considered " pro " -Crowley . 	1
WTP	13289	The Aleister Crowley Society site is not a social networking site , it is non-commercial , it has no partisan view to express or sell and it is considered generally to be the definitive Aleister Crowley site . 	0
WTP	13290	Inventions are not always tangible objects , they encompass theories , concepts and original thoughts of all kinds . 	0
WTP	13291	If the argument is that he wasn ' t an American when he created it , then why not change the category to " German inventions " instead of blanking it entirely . 	0
WTP	13292	He invented the concept of this theory . 	0
WTP	13293	How is it therefore wrong to call the theory an American invention ? 	0

WTP	13297	Israeli settlements being referred to as " cities , neighborhoods , whatever " is not the same as nicknaming the Israeli military , " Israeli occupation force . " 	0
WTP	13298	Thus that too is a " modern " culture thought . 	0
WTP	13299	Also the term " modern " is entirely POV too in the " modern " day the Church has 1 , 130 , 000 , 000 followers , modern people , who by choice of their faith do not agree with killing unborn babies either . 	0
WTP	13300	It puts across a POV which reads as if the Church and its followers are " wrong " to be anti-death / pro-life . 	0

WTP	13306	You could add pictures of protesters to get the idea across of what their group is like , but then it ' d make more sense to just include it in the text , except it doesn ' t really seem relevant to the article . 	0
WTP	13307	We all know what protesters look like : they span pretty much all ages , they sometimes go to events and important places , and they hold picket signs . 	0
WTP	13308	Are pictures of protesters really necessary in the article ? 	0
WTP	13309	As I said if someone wants to put a stopwatch to every episode you will find his time equal to the others . 	0
WTP	13310	We have had episodes in each of the last few season that one , or more , of the " main " characters has been entirely absent " Insheeption " being a good example . 	0
WTP	13311	Have you not listened to the mini-commentaries ? 	0
WTP	13312	Matt and Trey have mentioned more than once that Butter ' s is there favorite character . 	0
WTP	13313	Actually , there are no sources in the opening to back up any of the characters as being a " main " one . 	0
WTP	13314	Thus , I have reworked the section to remove the term and added a ref to cover Butters growing role . 	0
WTP	13315	However , when a reference is included , is isn ' t a copyright violation , it called a REFERENCE . 	0
WTP	13316	We should change the sentence back to the way it was seeing that the idea of SOAD not being nu metal is a minority . 	1
WTP	13317	This is not a legal , national , or internationally-recognized title . 	0
WTP	13318	If we used Smith ' s language , we would just use " sects " , I suppose . 	1
WTP	13319	The context of Smith ' s account makes it clear that he means " Christian sects " , but I figured " Christian churches " was a bit more understandable to modern readers . 	0
WTP	13320	I ' m fine with just using " church " , as that typically implies " Christian " . 	0
WTP	13321	Also remove Meteorites - again ancient problem well resolved , included in section " Previously disputed unusual natural phenomena " . 	0
WTP	13322	Belongs in superceded scientific theories rather than here . 	0
WTP	13323	Removed Continental drift as that dispute was resolved a half century ago so inclusion here is only historic . 	0
WTP	13324	From now a few mentions , it seems like you don ' t favor the use of the term ' denialist ' , which I can understand . 	0
WTP	13325	This is the sort of discussion that is important to have with members of the wiki editorial group . 	0
WTP	13326	They are criticism , not research . 	0
WTP	13327	Reviews aren ' t the same as histories or biographies ; they are critical commentary / opinion , and do not have authoritative weight on the histories and biogrpahies cover , because that ' s not what they are intended to cover . 	1
WTP	13328	So far I only see one source that would classify as such , that being this . 	0
WTP	13329	What Ibaranoff needs to provide is a reliable source ( or several ) that explain why System of a Down shouldn ' t be classified as nu metal ; providing sources that simply don ' t say the words " nu metal " isn ' t the same thing . 	1
WTP	13330	The MTV article cited describes SOAD as a nu metal band and provides a context for them within the genre . 	0
WTP	13331	Now , as for sources . 	0
WTP	13332	Aside from that , many of the sources Ibaranoff points to at Talk : System of a Down are album / live reviews . 	0
WTP	13333	Furthermore , one of the primary metal histories used a source for the article , Ian Christe ' s Sound of the Beast , describes them as nu metal as well , in a chapter largely devoted to nu metal ( I just double checked the book this instant ) . 	0
WTP	13334	Unless there is a reliable source confirming verifiable proof of what seems now to only be accusations , I don ' t see eeason to change this article . - - 	0
WTP	13335	We don ' t determine article content by tallying how many times a phrase is or isn ' t mentioned in a handful of online articles ( and that is a handful ; that ' s nowhere near the amount of press coverage the band has had in its career ) . 	0
WTP	13336	Also , the methodology used on Talk : System of a Down worries me . 	1
WTP	13337	Anything that detracts from the task at hand and causes blood to boil . 	0

WTP	13340	Cheers ! 	0
WTP	13341	The only criteria here is whether or not the inclusion of the word aids in the understanding of the reader , in knowing the history of the word for the animal . 	0
WTP	13342	We have already established that you clearly have no problem with having etymological information in the article , because if you had your edit would have consisted of removing the section " naming " altogether . 	0
WTP	13343	Thank you for the name calling , I think we can already see where you ' re coming from in this discussion . 	0
WTP	13344	As you are no doubt well aware , Wikipedia is not censored . 	0
WTP	13345	The version you substituted left the word completely unmentioned , which does * not * aid understanding and accessibility . 	1
WTP	13346	In fact it reduces it , because the reader can only be left in confusion wondering what the vulgar word might have been . 	1
WTP	13347	So clearly you believe we need information on the origin of the word here . 	0
WTP	13348	If so , we have to look at how we can make this section as clear and informative as possible . 	0
WTP	13349	Avoid words such as slander , traditional , liberal orthodox conservative . 	0
WTP	13350	I support the more correct wording even if it appears to others to be pro-Catholic ( which I dont think it does - facts are facts and we just want to tell the truth ) If we eliminate current wording in favor of Karanacs proposal , we lose several important wikilinks too . 	0
WTP	13351	We can ' t just eliminate important facts just to appear to be not - pro Catholic . 	0
WTP	13352	I think the present wording of the article is more correct than what you are suggesting . 	0
WTP	13353	I ' m sorry Karanacs , I disagree with your proposal . 	0
WTP	13354	Wassupwestcoast ' s argument is difficult for me to comprehend when we have spent ourselves with many scholarly works that support the current content and Wassup has not offered any scholarly works to refute the present content . 	0
WTP	13355	Changing it will make it POV anti-Catholic and factually lacking . 	0
WTP	13356	I suggest keeping the present form because it really is NPOV . 	1
WTP	13357	No ! 	0
WTP	13358	No ! NO ! . 	0
WTP	13359	( ec ) First of all , if Wikipedia could actually ruin Christmas , a lot of ass-clowns would have hijacked the Project for other purposes ; its an argument without merit . 	0
WTP	13360	Secondly , you will note that the Dede Maroz , Christkind or other names for Santa / Father Christmas aren ' t as widely read as this , one of the three main articles on the subject ( the other two being Father Christmas and Saint Nicholas ) , and certainly they aren ' t anywhere near the quality of this one ; they aren ' t a valid comparison . 	1
WTP	13361	Thirdly , the Buddha / Siddhartha argument is closer to the point , but still falls short via definition . 	0
WTP	13362	Siddhartha was a real chap , and pretty nifty on his pins , by all accounts . 	0
WTP	13363	Buddha isn ' t like a spiritual Santa Claus , though . 	1
WTP	13364	Buddha is state of being ; Santa is not a state of being . 	0
WTP	13365	As well , you are comparing a religious mythology with a cultural one ( and they are separate things ) . 	1
WTP	13366	From the article on mythology : According to F . W . J . Schelling in the eighth chapter of Introduction to Philosophy and Mythology , " Mythological representations have been neither invented nor freely accepted . 	0

WTP	13375	I think this is notable and the opening statement that Obama is our first black president in the Obama Wiki article should make mention of this , because of its historical significance . 	1
WTP	13376	How do Wiki editors think this matter should be handled ? 	0
WTP	13377	I remember reading in history books that Warren G . Harding was our first black President . 	0
WTP	13378	He was only partially black but this information was not bandied about back then for obvious reasons â¦ 	0
WTP	13379	I think the Wiki article on Harding mentions his black ancestry . 	0
WTP	13380	Harding even addressed the issue obliquely by saying that some of his ancestors " may have jumped the fence " . 	0
WTP	13381	Who have called for the destruction of the state of Israel and the etsablismeent of ( all of ) Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital ? 	0
WTP	13382	" Some people " here would include Hamas , no ? 	0
WTP	13383	So one article being wrong is grounds for another to be wrong as well ? 	0
WTP	13384	Like I said , and is also illustrated above , we have " votes " for these things . 	0
WTP	13385	Proper English is relegated to an afterthought . 	0

WTP	13390	If the user misbehaved , you should have banned the user , not blacklisted the resource . 	0
WTP	13391	( But note also that the user has only recently registered and obviously is still learning the ropes . ) 	0
WTP	13392	Blacklisting a site for reasons of Wikibureucracy sounds so hollow and ridiculous that I can only assume you are pushing some personal agenda . 	0
WTP	13393	Why not come clean on it or get out of the way . 	0
WTP	13394	My god what idiocy . 	0
WTP	13395	What does it matter if there is a conflict of interest or if edit warring took place . 	0
WTP	13396	The goal is to make Wikipedia as good as possible and , more specifically , this article as good as possible . 	0

WTP	13406	I am not deciding what goes in the lead . 	1
WTP	13407	( ec ) xandar , You are correct . 	0
WTP	13408	My position is that you started the edit war by removing a very central piece of information that had been in the article since 2006 as " utter irrelevance " , and persisting in reverting attempts to put it back by me and another person that just saw your removal as absurd ( I think claiming it ' s irrelevant is revisionism if anything ) . 	0

WTP	13410	- - 	0
WTP	13411	I think that the page should have been renamed Catholic Church and the first sentence gone the other way around saying " The Catholic Church , also known as the Roman Catholic Church â¦ " . 	1
WTP	13412	I think this is evident from the title of the book " The Catechism of the Catholic Church " which is conspicuously not entitled " The Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church " . 	0
WTP	13413	The Roman Catholic Church is the only one that officially calls itself the Catholic Church . 	0
WTP	13414	Xandar is correct . 	1
WTP	13415	Not only is HIV less than a century young , but HIV ' s relatives in primate species are all similarly recent in origin . 	0
WTP	13416	It appears to have hopped from cows to primates to humans , with the HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains in humans coming from different primate intermediaries . - - 	0
WTP	13417	A peer reviewer has made two suggestions for improvement to the article that would be significant changes . 	0
WTP	13418	Roman Catholic Church is part of Christianity and it would be inconsistent to make the comparison here , it would also be off topic for the subject matter of the page . 	0
WTP	13419	What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims . 	1
WTP	13420	It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics . 	0
WTP	13421	This is more than mere History , it has to do with the present day and the two issues of Origin and Mission go together , they are entertwined with each other and extend beyond the concept of History with regards to the church ' s activities in the world today . 	0
WTP	13422	Also , eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes . 	1
WTP	13423	It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page . 	0
WTP	13424	Currently , I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA , that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote . 	0
WTP	13425	Please add your comments and opinions to mine here on the talk page so we can come to consensus on these issues . 	0

WTP	13427	Thanks 	0
WTP	13428	We are only a couple of weeks away from resubmitting this article for FA and the vandalism is really an obstacle here . 	0
WTP	13429	Because the page sees several instances of vandalism every day by anions , I would like to ask Wassupwestcoast , our local admin on the page , to please reconsider his removal of the semi-security protection of this page . 	1
WTP	13430	We cover major events in a logical / chronological order rather than highlighting criticism or praise sections . 	1

WTP	13432	Hope that helps . 	0
WTP	13433	We generally just say what happened and not whether people are happy or unhappy about it , although critics and detractors are sometimes mentioned , particularly in some of the child articles about the " presidency of . . . " or the specific issues in question . 	0

WTP	13443	I am suggesting that the budget section is the best place , and that instead of the imprecise term " generous " , somethign like the $2bn 2001 figure but more recent would be a better way . 	0

WTP	13447	Conversely the minor restrictions recently placed by Britain would also be worth a mention unless there is a broader statement somewhere that covers multiple nations . - - 	0
WTP	13448	I think the " obnoxious and fervent " complaint has more to do with scale : the pro-choice photograph was taken at the March for Women ' s Lives while the pro-life one appears to be a smaller scale demonstration staged solely by Bound for Life . 	1
WTP	13449	I myself am against the addition of hip hop . 	1
WTP	13450	The genre is not prevalent enough in Rihanna ' s music I would say , and the influences of it that are present in her music are covered by contemporary R&B which is already listed . 	0
WTP	13451	But if more sources can be found and consensus turns to be in favor of adding it , I wouldn ' t have a problem with its addition . 	0

WTP	13505	The terms may sound silly , pompous , and old fashioned , but if that is an argument againt them , it is also an argument against both the names , but even more so the position and functions , of the " First Lady " and " First Gentleman " . 	0
WTP	13506	The titles mentioned of " First Master " and " First Lord " are in fact technically more accurate terms than " First Gentleman " , it ' s just that journalist and commentators seem to think that Gentleman is the equivalent of Lady in this context which , if you are pedantic , it isn ' t . 	0

S . / israel is logical , if this methodology ( for stating " facts " ) is used on the " Hamas " wiki page : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5182564.stm http://www.nlg.org/news/index.php?entry=entry090402-082738 http://www.humanrights-geneva.info/Israel-Lebanon-Israeli,2170 http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/opinion/03iht-edbouck.2378653.html http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1055241.html http://informationclearinghouse.info/article21992.htm http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/world/middleeast/19assess.html?_r=1 http://www.indymedia.ie/article/77507 http://www.btselem.org/english/Firearms/20060613_Gaza.asp http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3660668,00.html . . . did you want more referencing israel ' s " terrorist tactics " ? ? . . . . . . my point â¦ â¦ â¦ israel and Hamas are THE SAME . . . . . . as far as their " tactics " are concerned . . . . . israel , actually , WORSE if you take into account the NUMBER of civilian casualties â¦ â¦ so when I add to the " israel " wiki page , referenced statements about the international claims of it ' s " terrorist tactics " , I shouldn ' t expect any opposition from you , right ? 	0
WTP	13680	Now , since neither U . S . / israel claim that thier intention is to target civilian populations , we cannot choose to believe one , while dismissing the other . 	1
WTP	13681	I would just like the articles to be free of bias connotations . 	0
WTP	13682	I realize I will have to support my edit to others , but seeing the extent of your contributions to the " israel " wiki page , I don ' t want to have this discussion with you all over again in another place . 	0
WTP	13683	Provide a link to it and I ' m sure this crowd will weigh in . 	0
WTP	13684	If I were to move the " . . . considered in part , or wholly . . . . . . . a terrorist organisation . . . . " statement to a more appropriate section in the article and don ' t get any opposition from you , then it would be more in line with the method used on the " israel " wiki page . 	0
WTP	13685	I even like the wording used right now . . . . . . but . . . . in comparing it to the " israel " wiki page , it just makes sense to have it positioned in a different area . . . . . will you oppose this ? 	0
WTP	13686	I don ' t feel it should be removed , quite the contrary , there is quite the evidence and references that this is a common view held by international politics about Hamas , and therefore should be included in the " Hamas " page . . . . 	0

WTP	13802	That is the more serious proposal , covering people ' s negative opinions about Obama , and that is precisely what is discouraged on Wikipedia and has been rejected time after time . 	0
WTP	13803	That is normally based in fact , although there is a different sense ( one wholly unsuitable here ) for baseless negative assertions - but even those are assertions of opinion . 	0
WTP	13804	It would fit the Wikipedia concept of a coatrack . 	0
WTP	13805	Others refer to criticism as negative opinions about the facts of a thing , the oppositve of praise . 	0
WTP	13806	Responding to Jzyehoshua ' s point , you are referring to a different meaning of the word " criticism " . 	1
WTP	13807	What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts , which is not criticism at all . 	0
WTP	13808	And yes , I am disqualifying many of the accounts from which this was brought this up in the past - they are now banned as fake accounts , and the long-term editors here have been very wary of new accounts making similar proposals . 	0

WTP	13815	Well , that ' s a useful criticism , thank you , JoeSmack . 	0
WTP	13816	The new page could also address social ( young adults , thus orphans ) and political ( locations other than South Africa ) issues in more detail . 	0
WTP	13817	In such case , my opinion is that the Denialism section could be excised entirely and moved to the new page instead of being an awkward part of the HIV page . 	0
WTP	13818	Finally , if the issue really boils down to focusing more on the science ( which I generally support ) , perhaps yet another page could be created specifically about " HIV and AIDS Linkage " or some similar title . 	0

WTP	13883	Although the Washington Times is sometimes a reliable source for some content , it is problematic when it comes to politics due to the paper ' s strong conservative bent , lackluster respect for factual accuracy ( often mischaracterizing or printing unsubstantiated facts to support its position ) , and being very sloppy about distinguishing opinion and propaganda from factual reportage . 	1

WTP	14077	And beyond that , those who are calling psychiatry a pseudoscience per the CCHR sources are each unto themselves notable academics and researchers ( Thomas Szasz for instance certainly passes the WP : N threshhold , as does Fred Baughman , Julian Whitaker , and Mary Ann Block , to cite a few ) . 	0
WTP	14078	That CCHR is a " pseudoskeptical organization " is just a judgment of a Fyslee ( I tend to agree FWIW ) , but even if it was a judgment of another reliable source , that still doesn ' t disqualify the CCHR as a notable skeptical organization which has characterized something as pseudoscience . 	0

WTP	14143	The original question that opened this thread does seem to have quieted down which may indicate a defacto consensus . 	0
WTP	14144	You are correct that WP : Bold allows and even encourages an attitude of " Just do it " . 	0

WTP	14152	Of course , some UN or other civilian installations were hit , some with good reason ( any military use cancels the place ' s protection according to the Geneva Conventions ) ; some were hit by error - nothing and no-one is 100% accurate , and when people send rockets from the middle of the city , innocents are bound to get hurt . 	0

WTP	14165	I guess the most important thing to do now is to complete the to do list . 	0
WTP	14166	But this article is not a definitive " List of pseudosciences " but rather a " List of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
WTP	14167	CCHR is clearly not a reliable source for declaring what is and what isn ' t a pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	14168	Does this make sense ? 	0
WTP	14169	Characterized = point of view and hence this article should adhere to NPOV by presenting all significant POVs . 	0
WTP	14170	I will try to help you as much as I can since I am very interested in this subject and I think we could make this not just a good but a featured article one day . 	0

WTP	14172	If you want me to nitpick for a possible improvement I would say scrap the hearse pic and here ' s why . 	1
WTP	14173	This then raises the question of NPOV , which seems to be violated by granting undue weight to the sex abuse scandals . 	0
WTP	14174	Now , if the argument is that the article can ' t be FA unless the lead includes the sex abuse scandals , and we want FA rather than follow WP guidelines , well that ' s ok with me . 	0
WTP	14175	The abuse scandals hardly rate when compared with the other controversies that have surrounded the church . 	0

WTP	14177	I completely respect Ling . 	0
WTP	14178	Nut , but I think he ' s wrong on this one and is not taking WP : LEAD seriously : " It should establish context , summarize the most important points , explain why the subject is interesting or notable , and briefly describe its notable controversies , if there are any . " 	1
WTP	14179	The position Ling . 	0
WTP	14180	Nut advocates distorts historical perspective ; compared with other controversies , the sex abuse scandals are barely notable , and including it in the lead gives them far more than their due weight . 	0
WTP	14181	The other passage from WP : LEAD that applies here : " Well-publicized recent events affecting an article subject , whether controversial or not , should be kept in historical perspective . 	0
WTP	14182	Trying to put anything controversial about someone from the left is like pulling teeth around here . 	0

WTP	14189	We knew where we were in the 1960s and 1970s , and didn ' t really need these divisive labels . 	0

WTP	14192	The best way to proceed is to examine the September 2008 PBS interview and reference Ahmadinejad ' s remarks accordingly . 	0
WTP	14193	They are : 1 ) Move Origins paragraph to History section and move Mission paragraph to Church subsection under Beliefs 2 ) Eliminate Nicene CreedMy personal feelings on these two changes are that I dont think they make the article better or more informative . 	0

WTP	14217	Indeed . 	0
WTP	14218	I strongly believe that both labels apply to these controversies ( especially the T-shirt one ) , and the article should follow a more general tone anyway . 	0

WTP	14221	There I found the allegations of phosphorus weapon use , so I proceeded to add a few tightly written sentences including citations plus internal and external links . 	0
WTP	14222	So is the " undue weight " argument that that these allegations and countercharges among young Israeli soldiers , with serious repercussions throughout Israeli society , isn ' t as " heavy " as charges of phosphorus weapons use and can ' t appear beside it ? 	0
WTP	14223	I felt the content is relevant in light of interest among the English-language readership ( some of whom are likely to view it as fuel for criticism of the IDF and Israel ; hence my unfortunate use here of the terms " atrocities and war crimes " that I trusted was certainly not to be read as any agenda of my own ! ) . 	0
WTP	14224	It seemed to me a clear case relating to the Israel Defense Forces # Code of Conduct ( not , as you suggest , Purity of Arms ) â but as there ' s no specific incident under that heading , I posted under the heading Controversy . 	0
WTP	14225	I still feel that we ' re not communicating " on the same page " in this exchange ! 	1
WTP	14226	I am NOT talking about " bodies criticizing , " but rather IDF combat soldiers relating after the events to their situation in the field vis-a-vis their commanders , comrades at arms , soldiers under their command , and the population in the war zone . 	0

WTP	14256	I DID NOT " twist your words " . 	1

WTP	14258	Please . . . . . . when you DO make this argument . . . . . . . . remember to include all of the evidence that israeli " military action " has been successful in advancing israel ' s war against the Palestinians / Lebonese ( gaining military advantages anticipated ) . 	0
WTP	14259	Here ' s MY evidence that this is NOT true : http://a.abcnews.com/m/screen?id=6760726&pid=76 http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/palestinian-attacks-signal-failure-of-military-offensive-652232.html http://origin.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,244139,00.html http://www.ifamericansknew.org/stats/un.html http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article692233.ece 4 . 	1
WTP	14260	. . . so the Geneva Conventions DON ' T support your argument that Hamas ' actions differ from those of U . S . / israel . 	0
WTP	14261	No doubt you will bring attention to the statement : " . . . would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated " . . . in order to argue that U . S . / israeli actions are " necessary " and achieve a ( relatively ) successful military goal and that , in turn , justify the actions making them allowable by the standards of the convention . 	0

WTP	14267	Why are you pushing this common creationist falsehood about Popper ? 	0
WTP	14268	I don ' t think we should only treat the scientific aspects as a default , though we need much more material on this subject than we currently have , and as I mentioned I think the length of the culture section gives undue weight at its current size , though it could probably be expanded much further still with ease . 	0
WTP	14269	As for only treating scientific aspects , that ' s what we used to do , but the culture article was merged here to cover it all in one subject . 	0

WTP	14275	Unfortunately , the two sides are deadlocked : both cling to their preferred wording and resist any possibility of a compromise wording . 	0
WTP	14276	I have no particular attachment to the form of words I proposed , just a desire to see some wording agreed which roughly accommodates the various perspectives at play here and indicates to the reader that they will need more detail to fully understand what happened . 	0

WTP	14282	It ' s ofcourse not necessary to have a gallery as it says " The gallery tag is not a tool to shoehorn images into an article , and a gallery consisting of an indiscriminate collection of images of the article subject should generally either be improved in accordance with the above paragraph or moved to Wikimedia Commons . " 	1
WTP	14283	This is sensible advice because linking someone ' s words to a Wiki article can impose a meaning on those words that is not contained in the statement they made and consequently it can mislead readers . 	0
WTP	14284	My understanding of that statement is that it means , if it is possible to avoid linking from within quotes , avoid linking from within quotes . 	0
WTP	14285	Also Ibranoff , if you are going to keeping insisting " The sources clearly state that they are not nu metal " , you need to provide those sources so they can be evaluated . 	0

WTP	14297	OK , but as it is repeated , should the copy in the lede stay ? 	1
WTP	14298	I would suggest no , and to keep the copy in the Beliefs section . 	1
WTP	14299	In the lede it sounds quite a bit more specific and indeed almost narrow in context , whereas the rest of the lede is very general , broad , and top-down sounding . 	0
WTP	14300	However , given that I am hearing one " doesn ' t matter " and one ( apparently ) " no keep as is " , I am glad I brought it up first , and any further input welcome and indeed desired . 	0
WTP	14301	Further , I find it curious that I am being urged by several people ( unquestionably dedicated , but perhaps a bit narrow-minded ) to " use the Talk page " when those same people have repeatedly avoided addressing some of the issues I have raised here on Talk about the usability of this article . 	1
WTP	14302	Well , that might sounds a little pov as it might be different to everyone . 	0

WTP	14305	As for the ' I don ' t like it ' comment , I don ' t mind these images at all , I ' m just looking for the most suitable one , and preferably not one that ' s going to be removed every few days by someone who objects to it . 	0
WTP	14306	Now to address your point Bleh - your argument regarding sexual images is moot ; there are of course such images at commons if people want to see them , just as there are plenty of gory images of dead people and such , but there is no photograph on sexual intercourse of two individuals at the height of copulation . 	0
WTP	14307	Regarding pictures from long past wars , there obviously won ' t be anything in the form of a photograph , but there plenty of paintings etc . I had a very brief look for something suitable but there was nothing that especially caught my eye . 	0
WTP	14308	There is already a picture from a 20th century war just below in the suicide attack section , as well as the image of American graves in the lead , so I believe it would be more balanced to include something from times long past , like artwork from a chariot battle for example . 	0
WTP	14309	There is no need to show the most graphic or pornographic image just because one is available , and if an image is controversial for whatever reason there should be at least some rationale for keeping it . 	0
WTP	14310	It probably doesn ' t deserve any more than a sentence but not mentioning it could be seen as inconsistent with NPOV requirements . 	0

WTP	14314	It would not preclude attributing the material to the author of the work , but as such that should probably be made explicit for clarity . 	0
WTP	14315	What it does preclude is simply attribution of its material to the institutional church itself , as that would be the posterchild of original research . 	0
WTP	14316	Just two cents : the lack of either decree does not in and of itself preclude the use of a source here . 	1

WTP	14380	I ' m overwhelmed . 	0
WTP	14381	Even though I fail to see the meaning of that article , and how it contradicts this one , it is more accurate in its depict of the musical interrelations of the early bands , with emphasis on Black Sabbath . . 	0

WTP	14383	How do you know Black Sabbath ' s importance is false , a myth ? 	0
WTP	14384	The comment about " over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation " strikes me as odd : not only unsupported by WP , but contradicting the scientific nature of this topic which has inspired very careful research for over two decades . 	1
WTP	14385	The paragraph where Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , and Led Zeppelin are mentioned as pioneers of the genre is invalid ; it states that all three bands were reviled by critics . 	1
WTP	14386	First off , Deep Purple met indifference in their start , which is not the same as being reviled , which their albums never were . 	0
WTP	14387	With their success that followed in the U . S . , they were , however , acclaimed . 	0
WTP	14388	Secondly , Led Zeppelin never met criticism like that of Black Sabbath ; Zeppelin were , instead , criticized for not being as good as , according to Rolling Stone in the review of their first album , like The Jeff Beck Group , and Robert Plant was compared condescendingly to Rod Stewart . 	0
WTP	14389	Basically , not the same kind of criticism Black Sabbath got . 	0
WTP	14390	Sabbath were persistently rejected until their fifth album ( I dislike referring to wikipedia articles , but this is backed by the articles for all their first five albums ) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
WTP	14391	The criticism was a direct result of their alien-sounding music , which clashed with the current , which was blues-inspired Hard rock , like Zeppelin , Purple , Iron Butterfly etc . To conclude , the introduction falters and misleads , and should be rewritten more accurately . 	0

WTP	14441	Smith did not claim to " frequently seeing God " just as you say , however what is interesting about this article is when it is taken in context with Smith ' s own writings of how the community received his ideas does support his claims , if somewhat indirectly . 	0

WTP	14488	Often it adds information that is only evident to a professional ( explaining that the rhino in the picture is an african rhino ) but a caption should not add information not evident in the photo ( explaining that the rhino ' s name is Susan ) , unless this information can be sourced . 	0

WTP	14564	Like most sugeries , it is ugly because it is bloody . 	0
WTP	14565	And by the way , the medical illustration of partial-birth abortion that is all over the internet was medically verified by an eminent professor as an accurate depiction of abortionist Martin Haskell ' s procedure . 	0
WTP	14566	Stop with the tripe about propaganda . 	0
WTP	14567	However , since the lead effectively dictates the article as a whole , it is much more appropriate to tag the entire article . 	1
WTP	14568	If I could tag one thing specifically , it would be the lead , especially the inclusion criteria . 	0
WTP	14569	Do you at least agree that it is inappropriate to remove the { { bias } } tag without proper consenus ? 	0
WTP	14570	I am perplexed that you two ( Eldereft and Fyslee ) are saying that the tag should be removed , when all efforts to install such a tag have been summarily reverted without the benefit of a proper discussion . 	1
WTP	14571	- - 	0
WTP	14572	It seems like we are spending too much time discussing what is and isn ' t proper in terms of tagging , rather than discussing the heart of this issue . 	0
WTP	14573	Our current inclusion criteria would definitely allow sourced mention , especially since it is not us who are characterizing , but the sources . 	1
WTP	14574	The situation is that it qualifies as Questionable science , and because " some critics allege to be pseudoscience , may contain information to that effect , but generally should not be so characterized . " 	0
WTP	14575	It ' s all a matter of how the mainstream changes its views on things , and on how the V & RS document that change . 	0
WTP	14576	Who knows , at some point in time psychoanalysis may become a historical artifact that will easily fall into the " Generally considered pseudoscience " or " Obvious pseudoscience " class , and we ' ll then be justified in adding PS category tags to the articles ! 	0
WTP	14577	There was also some sympathy expressed by Eldereft there that " the psych stuff is worth a look . . . at some point ; no rush . " 	0

WTP	14596	Things in the UK certainly haven ' t got to quite the level that they have in the States , with Dioceses going into bankruptcy , but I really don ' t think you can that there is no problem with how the issue has been dealt with . 	1
WTP	14597	As I ' ve pointed out before , it has been enough of an issue in the UK that a previous Archbishop of Cardiff had to resign over his handling of abuse cases , and Cormac Murphy-O ' Connor also received pretty major coverage for his handling of a case when he was at Arundel ( less justifiably in that case certainly ) . 	0
WTP	14598	Ireland has also had a serious problem with many claims coming from those who were at catholic schools . 	0
WTP	14599	If Bush ' s front page for example is going to mention nice little subtlely negative implications and the controversies and criticisms surrounding his policies , and on just about every part of his bio , Obama ' s should too . 	0

WTP	14602	Thank you for the response , Wikidemon . 	0
WTP	14603	It simply isn ' t balanced in my humble opinion . 	1
WTP	14604	I see him and all of his policies made out to look fantastic here , and some of the entries make sure to point out how he ' s reversed Bush ' s policies , in a presumably positive way . 	0
WTP	14605	Even if the establishment liberal network media steadfastly refuses to cover most of it , and attacks those who do . 	0
WTP	14606	I don ' t see that , and much controversy and criticism certainly exists with Obama and his policies . 	0
WTP	14607	I wouldn ' t want that . 	0
WTP	14608	I don ' t push for Bush ' s article to be sterilized . 	1
WTP	14609	I just noticed the article has a tag reading " Note : Do not add " hard rock " here . 	0

WTP	14614	The UK of GB and I ceased to exist ; NI became part of a new entity called " The UK of GB and NI " . 	0
WTP	14615	It couldn ' t remain in something that ceased to exist ! 	0
WTP	14616	I disagree with this , and feel that use of the term ( heavy metal ) throughout the ' 70s was largely consistent with modern standards , and much of the crossing of " hard rock " and " heavy metal " very probably arose from the fact that many hard rock bands of the time did a few metal songs . 	0
WTP	14617	There are even exceptions to this ( particularly ZZ Top , Lynyrd Skynyrd , Foghat , and Meat Loaf ) . 	0
WTP	14618	The tricolour certainly is not the flag of Ireland , de facto or otherwise , just as La Bandera de EspaÃ±a isn ' t the flag of the Iberian Peninsula . 	1

WTP	15259	Now , I agree that the controversy section is severely lacking ( in quality , not length ) , and IMO one of the reasons is that this article does not have many dedicated editors . 	0
WTP	15260	There is no reason to detail each incident , and certainly not in the context of soldiers ' coming out ' to ' reveal ' something about the IDF , as indeed there is an entire organization in Israel devoted to this very purpose , which is not mentioned even once in the article . 	0
WTP	15261	Even if many notable organizations accuse the IDF of war crimes here , the article should take a more general approach , such as " The IDF was accused of war crimes for its actions in several operations , including Sabra and Shatila and Operation Cast Lead . [ ref ] " . 	0
WTP	15262	Therefore , I fail to see how something like this would not be undue weight for the article . 	1
WTP	15263	Firstly , I don ' t think it ' s our place to judge whether these actions amounted to war crimes , assuming the testaments are true and were reported correctly . 	0

WTP	15354	In addition , the fact that some HIV-positive people did not get AIDS after many years , as well as the fact that a cure or prevention has still not been discovered , supported the hypothesis that other conditions ( cofactors ) besides HIV infection might be necessary ; that is , AIDS may result from a combination of causes .

WTP	15433	More extensive description should , IMO , address issues such as the fact that most AIDS victims in Africa were never confirmed as HIV positive by testing . 	1

WTP	15436	The page on undue weight includes this : Other minority views may require much more extensive description of the majority view in order to avoid misleading the reader . 	0
WTP	15437	Thus , we see what is IMO a blatant POV term such as " denialism " instead of skepticism or " alternative explanations " in the section heading that gives lip service to other viewpoints . 	0
WTP	15438	This also suggests that the preponderance of media repetition of known information about HIV and AIDS may create the impression that minority views are " tiny " ( a subjective term ) . 	1

WTP	15474	Just like the headline figure of 4 , 00o clerics accused of sex abuse in the US , it has no context unless you add that in the 40 year period covered there were hundreds of thousands of priests and religious serving in the US . 	0

WTP	15479	If you believe that any restriction on land ownership is communist , then I ' m afraid you have a definition of " communist " that varies wildly from the commonly accepted definition . 	0
WTP	15480	In any case , this argument is entirely pointless : it ' s quite clear that the generally accepted view is that South Africa is a liberal democracy . 	1
WTP	15481	Nope , I believe the Soviet Union was really communist . 	0
WTP	15482	And , based on living here , I can quite confidently say that South Africa is really not . 	0
WTP	15483	Also , is " death " the first thing the soldier picture evokes ? 	0
WTP	15484	Without the caption , especially at the low image size in the article , it ' s just a person lying on the ground , apparently badly wounded , but not necessarily dead at first glance . 	0

WTP	15506	All of this is super easy to reference ; and yet , some editors refuse to allow any mention of it in the article . 	0
WTP	15507	How about an actual number of the victims of the abusers ? 	0
WTP	15508	This means including the strange yet notable viewpoints of organizations such as CoS . 	0
WTP	15509	If we are going to base our inclusion criteria on characterizations ( viewpoints ) then the article must adhere to the rigors of what NPOV says about viewpoints - in essence , this article must represent all significant viewpoints fairly . 	0
WTP	15510	As it stands now though , the article allows for the inclusion of items which are not pseudosciences - yet they are included in the list because some notable source has characterized it as such . 	0
WTP	15511	Again , if this article was simply " List of Pseudosciences " where we could only include entries that are either obvious pseudosciences or generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community , then we would not be dealing with this NPOV issue . 	0
WTP	15512	" Pseudoscience " is the characterization du jour and Scientology is a notable source ( not a reliable source of labelling something " pseudoscience " , but a notable source nonetheless which has made such a characterization ) . 	0
WTP	15513	But this article is not simply a list of pseudosciences ; it is rather a list of characterizations made by notable sources . 	0
WTP	15514	If this article were just a list of pseudosciences , then I would agree entirely with you - that Scientology ' s distorted view of science precludes it from representing the scientific community as a whole . 	0

WTP	15535	Some of the entries have only been characterized as such by a small fraction of notable sources while the majority of the scientific community wouldn ' t necessarily apply the same characterization . 	0
WTP	15536	Remember , this article includes entries which are NOT definitively pseudoscience - entries which per PSCI we cannot label as such even in their own articles . 	0
WTP	15537	Since we are dealing with notable characterizations , there is no excuse for dismissing Scientology ' s characterizations . 	0
WTP	15538	This is not a " list of pseudosciences " but rather a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
WTP	15539	However , this article is not about definitively labelling any topic as pseudoscience , but rather just including topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable source . 	0
WTP	15540	Enric , I personally agree with you re : Scientology ' s not being reliable at labelling something definitively as pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	15541	As such , we should not exclude their views from this article - as per NPOV . 	0

WTP	15546	But at least as a " List of pseudosciences " using WP : PSCI , it will be the exact same grey which we deal with at Category : Pseudoscience and on the individual article level - articles for those topics which reside in the grey amongst pseudo - , proto - , and fringe science . 	0
WTP	15547	This means that if there is a consensus to categorize a topic in Category : Pseudoscience , then that same consensus could be applied to include the topic in " List of pseudosciences " . 	0
WTP	15548	Absolutely . 	0

WTP	15550	Personally , as much as I find fault with the translation , I think that if that is in fact the legitimate " Official Website of the President of Iran " , then I would like us to add a cited quotation from it . 	0

WTP	15580	It could be argued that Catholics suffered more from this , since in most cases their historic faith was suddenly banned and a new one imposed . 	1

WTP	15616	Books like the Voices of Morebath show that popular involvement with the Church often decreased with the onset of the Reformation . 	0

WTP	15706	In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , [ 27 ] which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , [ 28 ] though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . [ 21 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] this phrasing and the use of the word " falsely " give rise to the idea that the other allegations of holocaust denial and anti-semitism are false . 	0

WTP	15723	When it does detract ( from the article ) , then that is due to what is in the Personal life section obviously mattering to people and having something significant in it ; it does not solely have trivial matters . 	0

WTP	15885	This is not vandalism , it is a content . 	0
WTP	15886	I can see two solutions : Personally , I prefer my suggested " technically left and rejoined " wording , because with the addition of only 3 extra words it conveys a much richer picture of what happened than either of two disputed versions . 	1
WTP	15887	The full situation is explained rather well in a succinct paragraph in the history section , but the " rejoined " summary in the intro could mislead the reader into believing that Northern Ireland tried out life in the Free State for a while before packing its bags and going back to London . 	0
WTP	15888	This sort of technical hiatus applies in all sorts of situations , and should of course be described where the issue is considered in detail â¦ but in a one-sentence summary to describe the situation solely as a " rejoining " is misleading . 	1

WTP	15931	In a speech on June 3rd 2008 , the official website for the Iranian President quotes Ahmadinejad as saying " the Zionist Regime of Israel faces a deadend and will under God ' s grace be wiped off the map .

WTP	15937	The quasi-religious defense of a monolithic consensus is the main problem that is undermining the value of this page . 	1
WTP	15938	As I said recently , the lead should focus on scientific facts , with minimal mention of social consequences . 	1
WTP	15939	Highlighting orphans in the lead here ( rather than only in the main body of text on HIV ) is itself an example of undue weight , because it over-dramatizes the social aspect of an article about a virus . 	1
WTP	15940	The social , economic , etc . consequences are covered on the AIDS page . 	0
WTP	15941	Undue weight on AIDS consequences in the HIV article leads to an undercurrent of HIV = AIDS , conflating the virus with the syndrome . 	0

WTP	15944	So as to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good , I would strongly suggest drafting a way to mention it in the lede , even if only a very minimal mention , so as to discourage such understandable but in the end not helpful edits . 	1
WTP	15945	While I fully agree with the concerns of recentism and historical balance ( consider in 1000 years what this article would look like : this flap would barely get a footnote if that ! ) , I also recognize the empirical reality Karanacs and others have mentioned , that if no mention is made in the lede , editors less informed about the editorial issues here will even in good faith bombard it with edits to mention it . 	0

WTP	15972	Steve Whitmire was not officially named as Henson ' s successor for Kermit until MUCH later , and his first appearance performing Kermit was in the special the Muppet did remembering Jim Henson . 	0

WTP	15992	Biodiversity does not have to increase . 	1
WTP	15993	The current trees produced go back to approx 550 million years back ( based on Cambrian explosion ) , that is our tree of biodiversity based on fossils , molecular similarity , etc etc . The fact that the tree converges to a common ancestor is based on evidence quite different from the evidence used to justify our current tree for biodiversity . 	1
WTP	15994	That ' s why biodiversity and common ancestor are two different theories that complement each other . 	0
WTP	15995	Saying that drift and selection do not produce diversity is therefore a very wrong statement . 	1
WTP	15996	You have to differentiate biodiversity from common ancestor . 	0
WTP	15997	Mutations , by themselves , will never produce diversity without a mechanism to retain the beneficial ones . 	0
WTP	15998	So mutation is the raw material for these two mechanisms to produce diversity . 	0

WTP	16045	Basically everything that ' s played in a minor pentatonic scale ( the final verses are in natural minor , the common minor scale , which is used by guys like Beethoven , for example ) is blues to you , and that ' s a very amateur approach , I must say . 	0
WTP	16046	I have already remarked on your less knowledgeable status as a musician which is clearly visible ; the final verses of " Black Sabbath " are in a minor scale and not bluesy in any way , but since you see them as blues , I kind of get where you ' re coming from . 	0

WTP	16121	The term apparently did exist by that point ( the first use by a critic according to this article was in 1968 ) , though it seemingly ( again , according to this article and its sources ) wasn ' t used by a writer in a context ( relatively ) in line with its current until 1971 on Sir Lord Baltimore . 	0

WTP	16126	" Highway Star " is sort of the prototype for a lot of speed metal and flashy ' 80s stuff , while " War Pigs " was obviously very influential to a lot of the doom metal and ' stoner metal ' material from the ' 70s ( Pentagram , Bedemon ) on . 	0

WTP	16145	Keepcalmandcarryon , I did not state that the treatment causes resistance to CXCR4 I merely pointed out that Hutter ' s patient did have the CXCR4 virus before the treatment which is a fact . 	1
WTP	16146	In one of the edits you reverted I had added a CNN article as a reference which had information about this issue . 	0
WTP	16147	" This finding is very surprising . " 	0
WTP	16148	As such the use of the term " Resistance to CCR5 inhibition is also less important if CXCR4 strains of HIV emerge ( these use CXCR4 rather than CCR5 as a coreceptor , from which they become independent ) , and the patient carried this virus at low levels " is fairly deceptive since it implies that this treatment does nothing for the CXCR4 virus . 	1

WTP	16335	I ' ve already addressed that argument , several times : Putting aside the veracity of the claim that the charge was " rejected " in the Hezbollah case ( it was not ) , it is irrelevant editorializing to imply that what was claimed in one different instance ( different time , different place , different organization ) is also the case in this instance . 	1

WTP	16339	The underlying facts do not seem to be in dispute , and are set out in detail both later this article at Ireland # History and also in Northern Ireland # History . 	0
WTP	16340	The treaty provided that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State , but would have the right to opt out and become part of the United Kingdom . 	1
WTP	16341	There appears to be agreement that there was clear expectation on all sides that it would do so , and this was done immediately after the treaty came into effect . 	1
WTP	16342	The whole process , which involved the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland travelling overland to London to personally present the documents , took 48 hours . 	1

WTP	16363	Maybe slightly more so in American English than British English as you indicate , but by no means is it something you ' d say in conversation with an elderly relative in the UK Â  ; ) However , as I am sure you are very much aware , Wikipedia is not censored . 	1
WTP	16364	There is a general content disclaimer , which applies to every article no matter how " basic " , regarding content . 	0
WTP	16365	- - 	0
WTP	16366	Please , let ' s assume good will and discuss this matter here . 	0
WTP	16367	You yourself partly justified Elizabeth ' s repressions by referring to the threat of invasion and internal rebellion . 	0
WTP	16368	That ' s fairly obvious , just like a history or pattern of lies , misbehavior or criminal behavior by Hamas would be relevant when they seemed to state a similar lie in 2008 or were accused of similar misbehavior or criminal behavior in 2008 or 2009 . 	0
WTP	16369	But my reference in the " Proximity to Civilians . . . " section to the Salon article about Hezbollah - - " the same accusation was rejected when it was made during Israel ' s 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon . [ 184 ] " - - has been repeatedly removed here without explanation . 	0
WTP	16370	This , as I said earlier , is a complex issue . 	0
WTP	16371	I ' m looking for a replacement . 	0
WTP	16372	I notice that one of our iconic Santa images got deleted . 	0
WTP	16373	I ' m very sorry : that crucial point got lost in all the volumes of discussion . 	0

WTP	16375	With regard to the English reformation , things like the disembowelment of priests , the Pilgrimage of Grace , the Prayer Book rebellion , the Northern Rising and the massacres of catholics that followed haven ' t been mentioned . 	0
WTP	16376	Nor does the passage emphasize the fact that in most countries the Reformation was state-imposed , people were forced to accept the new religion , their churches , church properties and the fruits of their donations were seized and handed over to the princes , and their worship forbidden . 	0
WTP	16377	You haven ' t addressed the argument above at all . 	0
WTP	16378	No one has . 	0
WTP	16379	Again , the section title is " close proximity to civilians , " a charge by Israel against Hamas , and Israel made precisely the same charge against Hezbollah . 	0
WTP	16380	Comment Well , it would be strange to " support " myself , but to repeat it : I think that the article needs a lead image that stands for " death " as broadly as possible , at least broadly for human death , which is what the article does focus on . 	0
WTP	16381	Instead of the painting ( which I inserted after suggesting it here and receiving no response for several days ) I would also agree with any other image of a human skull , although I think that the painting is very fitting . 	0
WTP	16382	The dead Gettysburg soldier is too specific for a lead image : this is not death in general , it ' s the death of a soldier in war . 	1
WTP	16383	The guy that sets our pub quiz said it was Gay And Proud , though it ' s probably just hearsay --Robert , Cambridge 	0

WTP	16393	Using the word sects , but quoting it , clues in the reader that Smith ' s 1830s use of the term may not necessarily mean what the modern reader might think . 	0
WTP	16394	It also lets us side-step the question of Smith ' s precise meaning . 	0
WTP	16395	I doubt the term sect had the same pejorative connotation in the 1830s as it does today , though certainly Smith was antisectarian , and like any Christian primitivist in the 1820s thought that sects and denominations were a corruption of the Christian church . 	1
WTP	16396	But rather than trying to parse the primary sources ourselves ( which could be [ [ WP : OR | original research ) , I think we ought to let the secondary sources guide us . 	0
WTP	16397	When Jan Shipps describes the vision story in her Mormonism ( 1985 ) book , page 9 , she uses the word sects in quotes : " this theophany answered the lad ' s question about which of the ' sects ' were right and which were wrong . " 	0
WTP	16398	Maybe that ' s the proper approach . 	1
WTP	16399	I don ' t think it ' s wrong , or necessarily non-neutral , to use a word like church or denomination in this context , but using Smith ' s own language--like Shipps does--has the added advantage of reflecting the flavor of Smith ' s early anti-sectarian views which he shared with other Christian primitivists . 	0
WTP	16400	I know some of the existing secondary sources , like Bushman ' s Smith biography , don ' t really make a distinction between church , denomination , and sect , but that ' s probably just because the authors haven ' t specifically thought of it as an issue . 	0
WTP	16401	I guess Bryan R . Wilson would be a very reliable source on the " historical usage " of the term sect . 	0
WTP	16402	I was actually looking for it in the FAQ at first . . . 	0

WTP	16406	The real issue is that DeltoidNoob ' s edit says that Smith translated " by the gift and power of God " . 	1
WTP	16407	I ' m confused about how you came to this conclusion . 	0
WTP	16408	' Crucifixion of St . Peter , by Caravaggio ' is also POV from a religious viewpoint and we should look for an alternative for this image . 	1
WTP	16409	Basically the argument boils down to censorship and this is not allowed by policy , and as someone else noted previously above we should have pictures of dead humans or animals to illustrate the topic of death not ' less offensive ' alternatives , some of which are off topic in this article . 	0

WTP	16411	I also notice that the source for throwing the rock has devoted more space to Ahmadinejad discussing Israeli-Palestinian peace talks so I ' m baffled as to why User : LibiBamizrach didn ' t include that in his edit as well considering that is unambiguously more notable than throwing the rock . 	0

WTP	16417	Isn ' t that a good thing ? 	0
WTP	16418	This would be a completely useful list , rather than the mess we are working on now ! 	0
WTP	16419	My guess as to why we haven ' t adopted this obvious and logical solution is that some editors want so badly to associate certain non-pseudoscientific topics with pseudoscience , that they are willing to throw NPOV and logic out the window just for the satisfaction of including such topics in this muddled and unencyclopaedic list . 	0
WTP	16420	Maybe you could be more specific ? 	0
WTP	16421	We can ' t allow some characterizations made by one kind of notable source but disallow other characterizations made by another kind of notable source . 	0

WTP	16423	The inclusion criteria allows for grey and - per NPOV - all significant grey can and should be included in this list article . 	0
WTP	16424	Now then , if that is a problem for us - if we cannot comply with NPOV - then I suggest ( as I have often suggested ) that this article becomes the very definitive " List of pseudosciences " and adheres strictly to the guidelines of WP : PSCI ( part of NPOV ) ; whereas we would only be able to include items which have been deemed pseudosciences per the general opinion of the scientific community . 	0
WTP	16425	I absolutely see what you are getting at and agree with you fully . 	0
WTP	16426	But where and how do we draw the line ? 	0
WTP	16427	We can ' t just allow some grey and disallow others , because " grey " equals " viewpoints " ( i . e . It is the viewpoint of the Society of Foo Skeptics that foo is pseudoscience . 	0
WTP	16428	Or Dr . Somewhat Notable has the unique viewpoint that foo is pseudoscience . ) 	0

WTP	16444	Also , most of the afforementioned articles do not share Abortion ' s hot-button pedigree , so there is little comparison between other articles ' use of graphic images and this one ' s failure to do so . 	0
WTP	16445	I cannot say whether graphic images at Gonorrhea , Feces , or Anencephaly add informative value to those articles , but , I don ' t edit them and so I will leave it to the Wikipedians who do to determine what is appropriate there . 	0
WTP	16446	Frankly , the " but other articles do it " defense doesn ' t hold water . 	1
WTP	16447	Other than being uninformative , it is my opinion that such images would detract from the quality of this article , by lessening its stringent adherance to NPOV . 	0
WTP	16448	Thus , their only function would be argumentative , and this is not the role of an encyclopedia . 	0
WTP	16449	Anything that can be depicted visually is better written in descriptive text . 	0

WTP	16563	There are bands that play ' hard ' ( riff driven , aggressive ) forms of rock , but aren ' t necessarily straight hard rock . 	0

WTP	16567	When do the sources actually say that ? 	0
WTP	16568	If " hard rock " is vague in any sense other than its direct relation to metal , it ' s because of its use as an umbrella term , which I suspect is only partially connected to hard rock as a genre in-and-of itself . 	1

WTP	16599	I don ' t think any other religion article breaks " origins " away from " history " and I don ' t think they should - the two terms are synonymous , and they should be discussing the same things . 	0
WTP	16600	As long as the lead touches on the origins of the church ( and I think it does ) , then the origins section can go in History , where it fits . 	1
WTP	16601	The paragraph on the church mission could fit very well into the beliefs section , or go lower in the article . 	0
WTP	16602	This is now very well explained in the article , just not at the beginning . 	0

WTP	16629	It doesn ' t matter what you put here , they will run you around with their own biased logic as to why it isn ' t " reliable " . 	1
WTP	16630	Burying Mission in Church will really make that important paragraph obscure and placing origins in hisory will make that paragraph disconnect with Beliefs for which it is a logical precursor based on Jesus promise to St Peter " What you bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven " . 	0
WTP	16631	These two items : Origins and Mission relate to the current activity of the church in the world today - not just history and thus they cant be considered history alone . 	1
WTP	16632	Also , I want to add that I thought all of Karanacs comments on Peer Review were fine with a couple small exceptions and I plan to address all of them eventually . 	0
WTP	16633	The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs . 	1
WTP	16634	It tells the reader the Why . 	0
WTP	16635	The church operates its many churches , missions and social ministries around the world today in response to a Gospel event discussed in the Mission paragraph . 	0
WTP	16636	Answering the question of Where did it come from is one of the first questions readers will have about the church - see the FA on Islam which actually puts the answers to this question in the lead and expands on it there as well . 	0
WTP	16637	Origins tells the reader Where did it come from which I think is an important question to answer up front since the Gospel passage in the origins section is the basis for the church existence . 	0
WTP	16638	The plans were later shelved following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , the worst oil spill in US history . " 	1
WTP	16639	It would seem to me not unreasonable to add one sentence under Domestic policy that says something like , " Obama introduced a proposal to expand areas open to off-shore drilling on March 31 , 2010 [ 45 ] . 	1
WTP	16640	I am OK either way . 	0
WTP	16641	I think the lead is just supposed to be a brief summary of what is in the aritcle and can ' t possibly include everything so we can use our judgement on issues like this . 	1
WTP	16642	That sentence is also in the Beliefs section under subsection " church " . 	0
WTP	16643	I dont have an opinion on whether we keep it in the lead or not . 	0
WTP	16644	Your point may be valid in a few hundred years at the least , when continuous demographic changes will finally have an impact . 	0
WTP	16645	But to say it now is jut ridiculous . 	0
WTP	16646	Multiple users have agreed with me on this point , so I encourage you to expand your horizons a bit â realize there are more specific articles on WP than this one about the First Vision and how Smith was treated in the 1830s â and target your edits about specific details to articles that are about the specific events . 	0

WTP	16652	People had donkeys and horses strung to carts and some who could afford it boats - - travelling a few hundred miles was equivalent to flying from London to Australia back and forth ten times . 	0
WTP	16653	My great granfather used to tell me that a whole village would come to say farewall to people travelling a distance between London and Edinburgh . 	0
WTP	16654	I agree that the Lebanese do get ahead of themselves claiming to be direct descendants of Pheonicians but to be fair , they are the closest to make that claim as do most semites in the region ( regardless of what DNA tests suggest ) . 	0
WTP	16655	It might be notable , and if so , its existance would seem relevant here . 	0
WTP	16656	Works for me . 	0
WTP	16657	While massacres and atrocities were wrought by the crusaders , nowhere does it say that the Church called for or encouraged these massacres but just the opposite - they were appalled and the massacres worked against the goals of the church . 	0
WTP	16658	Not much more than " it exists " is relevant here , so a wikilink would be the way to go . 	1
WTP	16659	There were no criticisms of the Catholic Church in Latin America - every book spoke of the Church taking a stand in every age against the abuses brought upon the people by the Spanish conquistadores and others . 	0
WTP	16660	However , I was surprised myself that what I thought had been the case in these events was actually not what historians thought . 	0
WTP	16661	We have not introduced POV into this article , I intended in every way to show the bad things done by the church throughout the ages in history . 	0

WTP	16666	Additional interpretation from the guardian link above : " The fact that he compared his desired option - the elimination of " the regime occupying Jerusalem " - with the fall of the Shah ' s regime in Iran makes it crystal clear that he is talking about regime change , not the end of Israel . 	0
WTP	16667	Two of our best scholarly works ( including Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity ) had whole paragraphs , one had half a page discussing how the evils of the Inquisitions have been overblown and they were not as bad as we have been led to believe . 	0

WTP	16700	Again , you ' re incorrect about how you ' re characterizing my edits , even as your own edits bespeak a lack of understanding of ( or a lack of focus on ) the issue . 	1
WTP	16701	The " an oil rig " wording was not created by my edit , it was created by yours . 	0
WTP	16702	http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&diff=prev&oldid=367249190 My wording had been " exploded a Transocean drilling rig " until Scjessey ' s complaint the section was too long after which I reduced it to " exploded a Transocean rig " , which you changed to " exploded an oil rig " , which , as I ' ve already established , created an entirely new link leading to a disambiguation page . 	0
WTP	16703	As to your point about piping , I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic . 	0
WTP	16704	I maintain that finding a Deepwater Horizon link within the phrase " a blowout exploded a Transocean drilling rig " is as intuitive as the example of an appropriate link at the Wikipedia : Piped link # Intuitiveness page you link for me as a tutorial , finding " Pontiac ' s Rebellion # Origins " linked within the phrase " war launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of Native American tribes " . 	0
WTP	16705	Now you ' ve changed it to " an explosion destroyed an offshore rig drilling for oil " , with no link at all , again , as if you ' ve got better things to do than properly edit this featured article . 	0
WTP	16706	( If you thought it worth a link before , why not now ? ) 	0
WTP	16707	The rig was not drilling for oil when it was destroyed by the explosion , as your edit makes it sound . 	1
WTP	16708	In fact , the drilling had completely ceased , or the cementing wouldn ' t have commenced 20 hours earlier ; in fact , the rig was basically done there , and about to undergo a routine check before unhitching from the well site and making way to another drilling location . 	0
WTP	16709	I take it you ' ve not caught much C-SPAN these past six or seven weeks ? 	0
WTP	16710	Please continue to accurately relay that the UN said the statement was a clarification and not a " backing down " or however it was characterized in the press . 	0
WTP	16711	Also , the article should note that the IDF itself stated that it had fired at school premises in early reports on the matter , for example here , and your own BBCNews citation states that Israel had first stated that its mortars had caused " carnage _at_ Fakhura school " ( emphasis added ) . 	1

WTP	16814	Terrorism is a tactic that can describe individual attacks without issue . 	0
WTP	16815	( ec ) There are also sources that call it a resistance organization that fights Israeli occupation . 	0

WTP	16817	Glyn_Moody ' s book ' Rebel Code : Linux and the Open Source Revolution ' which covers the birth of the Linux kernel amongst other things . 	0
WTP	16818	The book talks about 386BSD in quite a bit of detail and the fact that Linus was aware of it at the time on p65-67 and Linus is quoted as saying " if 386BSD come out a year earlier , I probably wouldn ' t have started Linux " . 	0
WTP	16819	Hurd is barely mentioned except to quote one of Linus ' s initial usenet postings on p45 [ 4 ] . 	0

WTP	16824	I don ' t really have too much of a problem with this dead-soldier ( though again a more " neutral " John-Doe-on-morgue-slab would be better ) . 	0
WTP	16825	If you want to put up a morgue or med-school shot of some anonymous " John / Jane Doe " corpse , I ' d probably be okay with that ( depending in that case however entirely on how likely it seems that some reader out there might be surprised and disturbed to see a deceased relative or loved-one representing this topic - - which again is just another aspect of the same reasoning and in the same way something that Wikipedia probably ought to avoid here . . . ) . 	0

WTP	16828	The lead image should be a good representation of the subject of this article . 	0
WTP	16829	As far as my " disapproval " of the dead-Pope image ( and " similarly " the dead-soldier image ) : it ' s not squeamishness , it ' s just the same reason why I thought the painting would be more " appropriate " here cropped down to just the skull . 	1
WTP	16830	That ' s all . 	0
WTP	16831	Choosing a lead image that also contains representations of the subjects of other articles weakens the effect , is distracting , is potentially confusing , and depending on the " other subjects " in question might easily be interpreted as editorial bias ( to the extent , in the case of the Pope , for example , of possibly causing offense to some readers ) . 	0
WTP	16832	As to taking it out all together and placing it in First Vision wiki article remember : King George , The British Empire . 	0
WTP	16833	As you wish , It might be useful though to make some modifications to the article so that you and I are happy with it first . 	0

WTP	16835	I think it is our duty to point out to each other any deficiencies or potential problems we will face at FAC . 	0
WTP	16836	My comments about using McBrien have only to do with his perception among the Catholic community as being somewhat of a rebel theologian and it is difficult to have his books listed in the beliefs section for that reason . 	0

WTP	16845	However , Obama never abandoned his religion or said he changed it . 	0
WTP	16846	Part of the problem in real life ( not saying it ' s here ) is that some want to defend Obama so much that they think he abandoned the church and want to wipe it out . 	0
WTP	16847	Obama ' s dispute was with Rev . Wright , not the religion . 	0
WTP	16848	The excuse is that it has been discussed before but what Mr . Saturn says makes sense , that he is United Church of Christ or Protestant . 	0

WTP	16857	the article is POV , i was denied multiple times to try to balance it , i did so while discussing it on the discussion page . 	0
WTP	16858	The radio programme quoted above is similar to other stuff produced on this page in that it contains no hard facts . 	0
WTP	16859	There is no scandal here in the UK despite many journalists looking for one . 	0
WTP	16860	It is primarily a US scandal , and , despite trawling the internet , no-one has produced evidence of any widespreaad world scandal . 	0
WTP	16861	The " scandal " is not " worldwide . 	1
WTP	16862	I have also noticed that the lead mention has expanded as i have predicted , and it will be cut . 	0
WTP	16863	I ' ve looked at the major Wikipedia RCC articles in other languages and none even discuss this so-called worldwide scandal , let alone have it in the lead . 	0

WTP	16870	There are more proofs and evidence suggesting that the content is groundless and untrue manipulated by the current Iran ' s government to justify Ahmadinejad ' s preseidency given that Iranian people have respect and tendency towards educated candidates . 	0
WTP	16871	Thus claiming a ranking system in 1976 , 2 years prior to the revolution , is untrue and groundless . 	0
WTP	16872	Prior to the revolution in Iran in 1978 , each university has its own entrance exam and no ranking system even existed . 	0
WTP	16873	This was the time that the nationwide entrance exam was started as a sample of equity and justice . 	0
WTP	16874	The entrance exam and the ranking system started in 1986-1987 and after the universities re-openned . 	0
WTP	16875	5 ) Iranian universities were closed from 1980 to 1983 due to the post-revolution anarchy . 	0
WTP	16876	4 ) Even if Ahmadinejad had taken the entrance exam in 1990 with almost double population than his time in 1976 , he would have ranked among 150 , 000 and not 400 , 000 ! ! ! 	0
WTP	16877	This is based on capacities as well and the data could confirm the fact that Iranian universities have considerably higher capacities for medical and social sciences than engineering programs . 	0
WTP	16878	The statistics shows that almost always 1 / 5 apply to engineering programs , 2 / 5 social sciences and 2 / 5 medicals . 	0
WTP	16879	It ' s clear they will never admit it , so it has to be highlighted publicly . 	0
WTP	16880	Yeah , there are so many double standards on this article , and this website in general that it would take a massive overhaul of the whole system to clear out the bias of these " editors . " 	0
WTP	16881	Yes , we shouldn ' t base our information on sources that are biased in the other direction . 	0
WTP	16882	On the other hand , a quick glance here shows no mention that there is currently any link between the AGI and PPFA , nor that there has been since 1977 , when " the Alan Guttmacher Institute was incorporated as an independent , not-for-profit organization " . 	0
WTP	16883	There is no vandalism . 	0
WTP	16884	Unless you have some to back up your assertions , this discussion is a dead end . 	0
WTP	16885	" Constant internet debate " is irrelevant here . 	1
WTP	16886	Only reliable secondary sources matter . 	0
WTP	16887	This is heading in an unnecessary and unproductive direction . 	0
WTP	16888	In general , our articles about politicians try to avoid sections devoted to criticism , and avoid criticism generally , because criticism is not really a pertinent biographical fact about people unless it is tied somehow to their life . 	0
WTP	16889	Sometimes a person ' s detractors , or problematic things about them or their actions , are of biographical importance , and they can be included . 	1
WTP	16890	For example , in his book Obama recounted drug use in his youth , something that is a significant part of his life story . 	0
WTP	16891	We don ' t call it a criticism or a controversy , it is simply an event that happened . 	0
WTP	16892	Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative . 	1
WTP	16893	It just doesn ' t work like that - we would have to calibrate Obama ' s article against not only other presidents , but all of his political rivals , those of heads of state of other countries , and so on . 	0
WTP	16894	And to what end ? 	0
WTP	16895	It is not our job here on this page to clean up the Bush article or speculate about what makes Bush a controversial figure , but if it is misfocused you are free to go there and try to improve it . 	0

WTP	16901	How exactly is the term " pro-life " not " Catholic " ? 	0
WTP	16902	As far as I know the term is a concise encapsulation of the Church ' s stance on these issues . 	0
WTP	16903	Still , I can see how the article can be improved through something like your suggested edits . 	0

WTP	16906	Multiple reverts are never a good idea on this page . 	0

WTP	16909	Maybe an article about weapon unloading . 	0
WTP	16910	Maybe in another article , although I can ' t think of one where it would be directly relevant at this point . 	0
WTP	16911	Therefore , it should not be in such a visible article . 	0
WTP	16912	It is clear that anyone not living in Israel would not correctly interpret this picture . 	0
WTP	16913	The patrol is in the territories , so the locals would obviously be settlers , but this is not about " cooperation with settler groups " . 	0
WTP	16914	From what I can tell from the picture , it ' s a joint patrol / weapon unloading by the IDF and local security forces , and this has nothing to do with the " settlement movement " or anything of the sort . 	0
WTP	16915	The above comment shows exactly why this picture shouldn ' t be in this article , as it can be broadly , and incorrectly , interpreted . 	1
WTP	16916	The object of a " theory " is to enduce debate , which in turn stimulates research and which in return bears fruit in the form of a " fact " , creativity is more important that knowledge ( " Einstein " ) . 	0

WTP	16918	I believe that aptitude would go further in real life , this write fest has certainly " evolved " into a one hell of a discussion , 	0
WTP	16919	Catholic Charities is one of the largest charities in the United States , I think it is in the top ten - per a Forbes article referenced on its wikipedia page . 	0
WTP	16920	I would also like to point out that the good things the church does - its current missions , orphanages , schools , universities , Catholic Charities and Catholic Releif Services only get passing mention with no elaboration on the vast number - millions of people helped by the church currently each year . 	0

WTP	16922	While the LGBT population of San Francisco is certainly one of its most internationally recognizable elements , it is one aspect of the many things that are recognizable about San Francisco and should probably be included in the lead , I would prefer that all the items listed there maintain a parallel structure . 	0
WTP	16923	The final paragraph in the lead does not need to have an overly technical representation of the gay and lesbian population of San Francisco . 	1
WTP	16924	The section has been treated no differently than any other paragraph that has contained criticism of the church . 	0
WTP	16925	Entropy1 , don ' t let me discourage you from trying to improve this article , but in this case I think you are trying to introduce conclusions that are not supported by mainstream scholars , including Mormon mainstream historians like Richard Bushman . 	0
WTP	16926	But the proposed material here , such as the newspaper articles , is not appropriate in this article . 	1
WTP	16927	The First Vision is a very important part of post-1900 Mormonism . 	0
WTP	16928	if the tone of my edits was not neutral ( this is how X is called by Y ) , or if my attempt to clarify the reasoning of ( X ) why it / they use this name were offending , then that should be discussed on this page or modified accordingly in the article ! 	0
WTP	16929	but it was removed and the removal reasoning was not clarified here and the discussion was left open because chose not to take part of the discussion ! 	0
WTP	16930	in that sense the article is not balanced , although i would say that as far as i can see , it does not introduce false information , but it defiantly shuts off a whole perspective of it ! 	1
WTP	16931	I agree . 	0
WTP	16932	It requires that all majority - and significant-minority views be presented fairly , in a disinterested tone , and in rough proportion to their prevalence within the source material . " , the last post in the discussion ( before my responses regarding the discussion ) was by Sean . hoyland , i confirmed to the constructive input that shows that no one but i agrees that the term IOF should be used in the intro , it is clear that this term is not welcomed by some editors , and seems offensive to some , never the less , it still represents a major perspective that the article is completely ignoring ! 	0
WTP	16933	regardless whether we agree on it or not ! 	0
WTP	16934	Can you please clarify how i am vandalizing the article ? 	0
WTP	16935	but lets not get drifted off the topic here , i will quote " The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting perspectives on a topic as evidenced by reliable sources . 	0
WTP	16936	Though I deeply respect my former professor Anderson , I don ' t think we can make much use of his BYU Studies article in Wikipedia , given that no non-Mormon scholar agrees with the underlying conclusion of his article . 	1
WTP	16937	frankly I ' m offended by you calling my edits vandalism ! 	0
WTP	16938	but i would rather keep the discussion revolving around the core issue of this discussion . 	0
WTP	16939	Thus , Obama ' s and most other Democrats pages stay clean . 	0
WTP	16940	They simply put you , me or anybody else who tries for a legitimate edit , through what is obviously a run-around , until we give up . 	0
